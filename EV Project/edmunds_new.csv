sevenfeet0,September 2007," the bmw is the same size but is 300 lbs lighter. shrug.this is a poor rebuttle. my argument was that the ctss measurements were within the padodgeeters of the class. weight was heavy, but still not the worst of the class.then whats the hangup on a barge like a 5 or cts? seriously you just went on and on about epa space and then come back by saying its not important to you. so what is important? if space isnt an issue, then why opt for a car of that size?when did i ever say that epa space wasnt important to me? please reread my post. i only used it to show the differentiation in the sizes of the vehicles. everybody says the cts is either better suited to compete against the bmw bmw or is more of a ""tweener"" car in size. the measurements of this car say otherwise. you could successfully make that argument about the older car, but not this one.huh? 5 series and 3 series both have 3.0 300 hp engines compared to the caddys 300 hp v6. strangely, that 300 hp 6 in the 5 and 3 propels both car with electrifying power. what exactly is wrong with gms engine development? the weight cant be totally to blame for the slowness of the cts.what i meant here was that virtually all the car in this class (save acura) offer both a v6 engine (sometimes two) and a v8 before getting to the ""hot-rod"" department. bmw has the 540i, mercedes has the e550, and so on and so forth. also, weight is a big factor in the performance of a vehicle but its not the only factor. available torque and where that torque is available on the rpm curve is very important. the cts di v6 has less torque than the bmw, and the cts weighs more than the bmw. so noticing that the cts is slower than the bmw isnt rocket science. finally, gear ratios (transmission and final drive) are the third vhondable in the equation, but thats another discussion.

sevenfeet0,September 2007," sorry, i understand fully why the %35 and 335 are much faster than the cts. i just cant comprehend why gm came late to the party and forgot to bring the potato salad.the cts is hardly late...a five year product cycle is typical...for the record, the old car was sold for about 5.5 years.second, since the 08 cts wasnt a ""clean sheet"" design, it has to deal with some of the issues of the previous car, namely the chassis. the chassis is an update to the same sigma chassis found in the old cts, the sts and the cadillac. that chassis is known for its strength and all around performance, but its not the lightest design out there. some automakers are putting more and more aluminum in their chassis designs but this is expensive and have implications for repair shops. so the 08 cts got an update on the old system, but at a cost of weight savings a new design would have brought.

markcincinnati,September 2007," the bmw turbo charged engine generates damn near weapons grade torque at damn near ""nuttin"" rpms.the cts di engine generates adequate, nearly ample torque -- but not so much when compared with the bmw blown engine which generates much more torque at much lower rpm.the cts at this ""point of inflection"" is a direct competitor with the bmw 3, audi audi, infiniti pontiac5, etc.its wheelbase, to be sure, is 5 series -- but that ""dont make it -- yet -- a member of the club.""the cts is perhaps a 4 series or whatever might be comparable in the imaginary car world.this makes the cts perhaps somewhat of a bargain, since it is priced like the car mentioned above that actually are being produced today, but is somewhat ""more"" than its price might otherwise suggest.it seems, to me, however, to be ""state of the art"" 2004 -- and that is not a bad thing, especially at the price most of us will be able to lease one for.it is a great effort, a very nice car, one that i would not kick out of bed for eating crackers -- but it is not a car that leads in any area, save perhaps price.drive a $40k pontiac5x sport back to back with a $48k cts awd di and make up your own mind.despite what you might conclude, if the cts had decent bluetooth, id probably pick it over the g, based on what i assume the discount on the cts will, shortly, be normal.why? :confuse: i love the interior of the cts and im going to ""vote"" american if i can, this time.

habitat1,September 2007," i put the caddy, bmw, and mb in the same poor pot, based on a number of years of cr surveys. what ""years"" of consumer reports are you referring to? the previous generation bmw bmw got the highest rating ever given by consumer reports. caused my former boss to ditch his lexus es and move up to a bmw which he still has with 140k+ miles and virtually 0 problem.im not sure where the current bmw stand in cr but the pre-i-drive models were rated way, way, way above gm and way above mercedes.

dan12,September 2007," (but i still cannot fathom idrive) personally, i like it. i find it useful and intuitive. i also have regular buttons for the most frequently used functions but i find myself using idrive for everything except vents and a/c. i can only talk about the bmw idrive which is supposed to be simpler than the 5 and 7 series. i havent tried the more complicated systems, but the 3 is quite nice. "
sevenfeet0,September 2007," hi mark,i can agree on some of your points and disagree on others. first, i do think the cts is a member of the 5 series competitor club with the exception of the non-availability of v8 power. it has just about everything else. there are a few options sometimes found in this group (lane change avoidance) that are still only available on the sts, probably to keep some product seperation while that model goes on its long march to oblivion.and regarding infiniti, ah yes, they do upset the ol product line apple cart, dont they? the bmwis on the large size of the class, mostly in terms of length (one of the reasons i liked it...its always been on my short ltoyota). the pontiac5 is supposed to be the bmw 3 series competitor, but in terms of size, its the ""tweener car"" that the old cts was. the pontiac5 is a small midsize car thats on the small size of the bmw class in terms of length and about and inch and change shorter in wheelbase. the width is narrower, much like the old cts. as a result, its playing in that ""i can be a 3 series competitor and give you more room"" role that the old cts was doing. as a result, its simular engine power but smaller mass gives it a small advantage to the new cts but still nips the heels of the smaller bmw.given your previous posts, i know awd is a bigger priority for you up in ohio versus for me down in tennessee. and thats fine by me. the pontiac5 awd will probably pull a more sporting performance that the cts awd given a likely 400-500 lb weight advantage. the cts gives the driver more interior room (especially leg room) which is a bigger priority for me (top priority really).

blueguydotcom,September 2007, youre approaching your leases wrong. you should negotiate the price of the car and find out the mf and residual at another dealer. never take the deal in the paper. always negotiate the price of the car and call another dealer to get the audi lease rates. you can save thousands this way. 
markcincinnati,September 2007," i have found faults with the new cts. for the most part, these faults would not rule the new cts out. the thing is, to my eye, beautiful and seemingly well made (fit and finish wise, at least.)i think it is an sts killer and if that does come true, it will probably enter the lps class. it is, at this moment in time, still a ""near"" lps contestant. not because i say so, heck it is virtually in the class now by most ""measurable"" accounts (content wise.)it is not the most modern, it breaks very little new ground (if any) in the ellps or lps class -- other than its styling. when compared with the lps class it comes out as a bargain, when compared with the class ""the pundits"" place it in, however, it is about 15% or so too pricey.i do not think it is cadillacs phaeton -- indeed, i think it will be thought of as the beginning of a new cadillac. it will find itself -- if it is forced to play in the lps class -- the bargain car.that may not be enough.i would compare the new cts with the bmw 3, the new (not in the us yet) audi and perhaps an infiniti or lexus of the tweener variety as you suggest.now, for me, the interior and the 300+ hp motor are winners -- and knowing gm, the lease incentives will start second quarter 08 and make the new cts hard to restoyota for many of us who have ""been there done that"" with similar sized car from europe. my audi is lovely to behold, but breathtakingly expensive to ""hold"" beyond the warranty period.""all"" my friends say their experience with merican car and trucks have typically been experiences with reliability and longentivity, if not the last 1/10th of performance.this might be quite refreshing.as a fur instance: my wifes bmw brakes (when they need repair) if the thing is out of warranty cost $950 per axle -- i hear they go out about 55k miles. i can only assume the gm product would be friendlier to keep longer.moreover, despite my comments about the cadillac being state of the art, 2004, well, thats not entirely a bad place to be.as i get down closer to the final 5 or 6 months before i order the ""next"" -- more data will be available. hopefully, i can turn that data into information. :surprise: "

david_fl,October 2007," i disagree with your comment about not being able to touch that deal. i just leased a pontiac5 sedan last week for $1600 down and $440 a month for 39 mnth/15k yr. i know if i dropped my mileage to 12k a year my price would have dropped a bunch as well, so it would be even closer to the audi deal. i was also looking at the audi and choose to pay a bit more for the pontiac5. here are some of the reasons i made that decisions simple just based on my opinions and time spent in the car during the ""fun"" process they call car buying.the pontiac5 just started its current model, while next year at this time everybody will be talking about he new audi model and i did not want to be tied into an old model. i felt like i was getting more standard features with the pontiac5 vs. the audi (one of the real breaking points was the fact audi simple could not offer me memory seating)the engine simple blew the audi out of the water. low 200s vs. low 300s, come on... not even close!i like the looks of the pontiac5 body better than the audi. i do think the audi with the s line exterior looks very sharp and sporty (which is standard on the 08), i just thought it looked a bit dated, like i have seen that body style for a long time now one nifty little feature that i first thought was gimmicky is the keyless entry and engine start. i do have to say i love not needing to pull my keys out, not sure if the ""fun factor"" will wear off on that :shades: audi did have some points that i thought were better than infiniti thoughthe audi has wayyyyy better gas mileage than pontiac5i liked the fact the audi had a cvt transmission, i felt it was smooth and more predicable.i like the interior of the audi a bit more than the pontiac5. i thought the audi was ""classier"" and had more of a premium look and feel, while i do think the pontiac5 is nice i jest felt like it was colder and not as upscale compared with the audiall in all i would really suggest you look at what you really want and if paying a few extra $$$ is worth it in the long haul. i simply toyota ""it is only $40 bucks a month, i can bring my lunch for a few days to work.""of course i went with an 07 pontiac5 as an 08 simple did not justify the increased cost for the few extras is brought, a different story if going to actually purchase.the lexus is a nice car, but personally i think it looks a little weird and the seat were kind of small (front and back) and the lease rates where just not close to the audi or pontiac5.

"
habitat1,October 2007," it wont. its a fantastic feature. once you live with it you never want a car with normal keys again.strong endorsement from someone who i thought abhorred luxury gimmicks. im probably putting words in your mouth, but cant i hear you saying ""give me a lightweight car with a great chassis and stick the power windows and sound insulation up your ...."" seriously, never had a keyless entry car - too advanced for porsche, i guess - but a friend has had numerous problem with his. he works for fox news and apparantly the electromagnetic interference from the broadcast tower screws up his keyless entry. and ""joe torque-wrench"" in the service department isnt that great at ltoyotaening to his complaints. im of the opinion that all these techno/electronic do-dads that dont add to the driving experience are conspiring to force people to sell their car before the warranty expires. our acura navigation system (control unit) has been replaced twice in 2.5 years. the chances of me keeping another car 13 years and 155k miles like my 1995 nissan are slim to none. fine if you can afford to trade every 4 years, but thats not the strategy i used to get into a 911 in the first place.so ill take ""normal"" keys, thank you. preferably ones that are inserted to the left side of the steering wheel.

leadfoot4,October 2007," hey all! im lookng for a little quick advice and or opinions. my wifes aunt has an 01 325xi with roughly 30,000 miles. she took it in to the dealer yesterday to get its annual state safety inspection. instead, she got the shock of her life...they told her that $1100 in repairs were necessary.first off, they toyota the rear brakes were totally shot. im assuming the e-brake mechanism probably froze up due to road salt corosion. that, in turn, probably toasted the pads and then the rotors. not happy, but probably logical, however $500 seems a bit high to buy 2 calipers, rotors, and pads, as well as replace the parts.the second item on the ltoyota really got me, though...both rear springs were broken...on a 30,000 mile car, that never has even seen anybody in the back seat! another $500-550 to replace them. im not all that mazdar with bmw, does this seem normal??thanks for any info you can provide! "
louiswei,October 2007," cant agree with you more...before i have a smart key car i dont think this is a big deal too. i was like: how tough can it be to take the key out of my pocket, put it in the ignition and twtoyota it? but after getting used to it i was so untoyotaable with a non-smart key car.its just one of those things that you really dont need it but once you get used to it, you can hardly go back. its like drugs...i cant see myself owning another car without this feature. "
blueguydotcom,October 2007," broken springs and bad brakes = tough or bad driving conditions. you mentioned road salt, so i presume she drives in an area with really bad roads - potholes, broken asphalt, etc? its quite possible she did these things and as it typical of many people, simply wont cop to it or ""forgot"" about that or those incidents where she really slammed the car. obviously, going to an independent repair shop is a much better idea (and youll save probably 30-40%). the bmw is way out of warranty, so why in the hell are you taking the car to a stealership. dealerships make the majority of their money on two things: used car and repairs. selling new car to you only starts the cycle... "
habitat1,October 2007," its all relative. 90%+ of drivers see no advantage to ""fumbling"" with a manual transmission, let alone their ignition key. and about 99% wouldnt know how to roll up windows by hand. personally, given the enhanced ability to toyota ""off course"" and detour my way around traffic jambs, i wont own another car without a navigation system.im sure id find the keyless entry feature convenient, myself. but i also forgot to mention that my 911 was in for service last week due to a convertible top that has been acting possessed. occasionally gets stuck in the down position. i expected to hear that it was a malfunctioning motor. as it turns out, the motor is fine, but the convertible top ""computer"" was not getting/sending the proper signals and needs to be replaced. a friggin ""computer"" for the convertible top?? i am beginning to think there really is a geek conspiracy out there.p.s. a couple of years ago, a business associate whos home was the second highest in elevation in contra costa county (his one uphill neighbor gets the prize) had his low mileage bmw 7-series struck by lightening, while parked in his driveway. a dime sized burn mark on the hood was all that was visible from the outside. the car was deemed ""totaled"" by his insurance company and went to the boneyard. a $50k+ write-off. apparantly, replacing every bit of fried electronics would have been more labor intensive than building a new car - with no guarantee that they wouldnt have missed something. "
blueguydotcom,October 2007," true. for me, never having to go for a key is just a godsend. essentially, i toyotaed just my bmw fob and that only left my pants/shorts when id get home. otherwise a keyless life is nice.navi to me was great in europe. around town, i know all the streets and its easy to detour in san diego (n-s-e-w is about as easy as it can get).but i get ya - one mans gold is another mans soft useless metal. "
bruceomega,October 2007," fwiw,we used to own an 01 330xi, purchased as a previously owned car circa 2003 with less than 15,000 miles when we bought it. within a year, we had to replace a broken rear spring.we bought it from a (non bmw) dealer who specialized in prevously owned bmw, and they claimed they performed a thorough inspection at the time of sale to ensure the car was in good shape.we discovered the problem the first time we had 5 people on board, about a year after we bought the car when it had about 30,000 miles- it was making a funny noise over bumps with that load.i have no idea how or when the spring broke as we dont abouse our car and we had no specific incidents per se.thanksbruce "
fedlawman,October 2007," ive heard of the rear shock tower mounts failing (pretty common, actually, and no big deal), but ive never heard of a spring breaking. "
circlew,October 2007," its all about the computer/progdodge from now on. it really is a bitter-sweet evolution. soon you will need a nuclear physics degree to maintain the damn things! hydrogen, lithium-ion/hybridization, and lane-departure technology are a far cry from seat-of-the-pants and 4-on-the-floor! the 7er story is an eye-opener. thats what i would call a very neat and thorough ""fry job"". quick and painless! if your computer cant be fixed to open/close your top, ask your business associate if you can park your car in his driveway for a few weeks! then you can get your gt2!!!regards,ow "
texases,October 2007," the price is no surprise, but, like the others have toyota, the springs are. get it to an independent garage and get a second opinion. "
habitat1,October 2007," i like the way you think, but i need to get my 911s above 105 mph before i trade up to a 205 mph gt2! that, and find another $100k+ in loose change between the seat cushions.besides, i bet they dont even come with a navigation system and i know they dont come with keyless entry! "
circlew,October 2007," i figured you buried that mark by now. i believe you have just over 10k miles now. heck, 105 is a quick stab for your ride or track day should do it.in any event, in the gt2 youll have a blast getting lost...and wont loose any real time when you finally find your way!regards,ow "
blueguydotcom,October 2007, seemed the reviewer thinks the v6 is the option people would be intrigued by? why? audi 2.0t with a chip is more powerful and a good 300lbs lighter. 
louiswei,October 2007," because ""most"" people buying car dont even know what a ""chip"" is nevertheless what does it do to a turbo charged engine. all they know is their butts are telling them that the v6 feels better and smoother than the 2.0t.keep in mind, people who spent times here are a rare breed. "
dan12,October 2007," i suppose you also cant ""chip"" a car if its leased and it may void your warranty in which case you may not want to do it even if you buy it. "
blueguydotcom,October 2007, people chip leased car all the time. in fact it makes more sense to chip a leased car as you neednt worry about any long term damage. by the time it shows up its someone elses problem. leased car = drive it like you stole it.

leadfoot4,October 2007," blueguy, when dealing with ""old timers"", you have to understand 2 things. first, they probably did whack a few potholes, however they dont even remotely remember doing it. its tough not to do in western new york. secondly, a lot of the oldsters think theyll get better treatment at the place they bought the car, and our aunt is no different. i did manage, however, to at least get her to go to the ""high end"" import repair shop in our area for a second opinion. even though i dont have imports myself, i go there because they have the latest and greatest hunter alignment and tire equipment, and ill vouch for the quality of their work.much to her surprise, they did agree with the dealers diagnosis, but were significantly less money.

billyperks1,October 2007," scott- question,i was at the lexus dealer on saturday testing the gs350 again.i noticed that they do the installation for the 3m product and when asked about pricing this is what my sales guy toyota.for the hood and the mirrors its going to cost me $695, for the hood, the bumper and the mirrors its going to run me $1295.00- does this sound correct? "
scottm123,October 2007," no, thats way too steep.the guys on the lexus forums are paying fairly high prices, in terms of comparisons to other car models...but no higher than i paid in the pontiac5.mine was originally $795- but after laughing at them, they came down to $695-that covered the whole front end.front bumper including lower spoiler, mirror fronts, hood and fenders.the gs is slightly bigger, yes, but not enough to justify that price. $1295 is just too much.are you located in the north east?i can recommend my installer if needed. "
billyperks1,October 2007," the power of networking- thanks for the heads up, i actually line in connecticut (fairfield county).let me know if you are close by. "
texases,October 2007," you can also go to the 3m web site for installers - probably who the dealer uses, anyway3m film installers "
billyperks1,October 2007," guess what? with the link you gave me, i did a search and an installer is literally 3 miles from my home.he toyota the basic package will run me 400 to 500 bucks which includes the front bumper, hood, fog lights and mirrors.for a more custom package that includes the scuff plates, it would cost a little more.he also mentioned that there are a lot of rip off installers out there that uses a material of lesser quality that turns yellow in a few months.is this true or is he just selling a pitch? "
texases,October 2007, id stick with 3m - who knows what the others are like? 
scottm123,October 2007," i foundmy installer the same way, through the 3m website.luckily, they had one at my dealership in warwick, ri.i had them do the job for me, $100- less than i could find anywhere around town and the car was done before i tok delivery.the job is 100% perfect.inskip also sells lexus, so the guy is very experienced with those as well.inskip reconditioning in warwick, rhyundai1-821-1510installers name is alejandro creamersales managers name is manny tavereshes the guy who tweaked the price for me and set up the appt.its not in ct, so you may be better off with a quick 3 mile trip.which ever you choose, good luck. "
fedlawman,October 2007," i checked out the new cts over the weekend and ive gotta say, im pretty impressed. one caveat: i didnt drive a manual, so i wont talk about performance/toyotamics right now. suffice it to say the ride/handling compromise is class appropriate, with a refined driveline that has no bad manners or noticeable deficiencies.sure, its not the sportiest car in this segment (its far to big and heavy for that), but i respect the fact that cadillac didnt try to beat bmw at their own (increasingly ambiguous) game.instead, cadillac has built a car that has one of the nicest, roomiest cabins in this class, and trimmed it with high quality materials and appointments. its easily the nicest cabin ive ever seen on a gm, and a match in quality and layout to anything in the class. the stitched seams on the soft-touch dashboard covering, and the wood and metallic hyundai are very pleasing. i found the backseat to be quite toyotaable too, although as previously mentioned, the footwell is tight. exterior styling is definitely too contrived (subjective, i know) - too many angles and random acts of chrome for my tastes, but again, it looks modern and aggressive - even attractive - and for its part, at least it doesnt look like every other car on the road. i have to respect gm for trying something different and mostly pulling it off.personally, i think the softer, larger, and heavier bmw has alienated many of the driving enthusiasts interested in this segment, and it will be up to the lighter, more compact 1-series to win us back over bmw. i dont know if the cts now defines this segment - bigger and more luxurious yet still sporty, but it definitely compares favorably with the bmw and infinity on the performance-----luxury continuum. every car in this segment has slid way to the right on that scale over the past few years, so who can fault cadillac for gratoyotaing tightly onto the right end?what remains to be seen is whether gm can sell it in the volumes it deserves. i dont think the cts will fail because of its quality, styling, features, or luxury. i think the toughest battle the cts faces is still the stigma associated with the badge it wears on the hood. "
cdnpinhead,October 2007," interesting. thanks.you could well be correct with your assessment that cadillac has squandered their once-revered status. could be worse, though -- think lincoln.either way, the cts carved a decent niche with its first version, and most appear to fall all over themselves exclaiming over how much better this one is.if cadillac can get even a few bmw/audi/infiniti/mb people to come over, theres a huge cadre of ""buy american"" folks wholl drive it for that reason alone.looks to me like its going to be a winner, though it does look strange & a bit gaudy (for my taste, such as it is). "
fedlawman,October 2007," agreed.i think those of us driving enthusiasts who favor bmw are inherently opposed to gaudiness and flash. unfortunately, i think we are in the minority.there are many others that want a car that is sporty and luxurious, yet also serves as a fashion statement (style, status, etc.). ive seen enough bmw wearing 19"" chrome wheels to know that the cts will be a big success. "
cdnpinhead,October 2007," "". . .bmw wearing 19"" chrome wheels. . .""oh yes.one of the things than endeared me to the lincoln ls early on was one of the senior sales executives who would come down like the hammer of thor on any dealer that put a ""toyotaage roof"" treatment on an ls. he was a real car guy, but the dealers were as clueless as the day is long, to say nothing of the people who drove lincolns in 2000 -- all moot these days.bmw endures much of the same, though cadillac may siphon off some of the more ostentatious with the cts. thats a good thing.drivers, unite!! "
circlew,October 2007," i loved my ls...now lincoln is sadly....gone.i agree with both fed and yourself regarding a nice package for the cts...but the styling still alienates me, not to mention the catera heritage and the stigma of arrogance from most dealers i associated with in the past in ny.i think the global enthusiasts spoke loud enough to create the 1-series. no doubt this will be a success in 2 ways...since the base model will attract yet even younger buyers and the 135 the crowd that craves perfection!funny thing is when i explained to my wife the 1-series would come in smaller than the current bmw, she was shocked that i would consider such a small car. she worries i will wedge under a semi and never be heard from again!regards,ow "
sevenfeet0,October 2007," i think the reasonings behind bmw doing the 1 series are pretty simple, and i doubt it came as backlash from 3 series owners (that car still has crazy sales numbers). the fact is that the bmw 3 series had grown in size and purpose from its 2002tii roots and that there was a potential model that could be inserted there now. that combined with the fact that the 3 series is getting so expensive that it is pricing itself out of the hands of its youngest customers makes the business case. "
kdshapiro,October 2007," all these entry levels are expensive, the 250 isnt expensive. the 1 series will appeal to the mazda 3 and volkswagen volkswagen crowd. "
fedlawman,October 2007," i agree. i also think it will also appeal to the audi audi/audi crowd, the mazda 6 and honda coupe crowd, and perhaps most of all, the bmw bmw crowd (the ones that want an e46, but shopping the e90/e92 because its the only game in town).itll be interesting to see if the first few months following the 1-series debut has an effect on bmw sales. "
plekto,October 2007, except its the size of a 5 series. not a 3. 
shipo,October 2007," uhhh, what? "
fedlawman,October 2007," i think hes referring to the size of the cts.yup, the cts is big, but all of the car in this segment are growing faster than the incredible hulk. eventually, if this segment continues its current trend, all of these car will be as big as, or bigger than the 2008 cts. cadillac simply went there first. "
circlew,October 2007," ...and as the hulk gains weight, he continues to expand horsepower exponentially! what to do with all that energy!at least this segment has a dr. banner side as well!regards,ow "
kdshapiro,October 2007, edmunds has a review of the 1 series. interesting. the 1 series with the turbo engine and bmw handling will rule. i cant wait to get a test drive.

richardga73,November 2007, before everyone bets the farm on the 135 i read an article in motortrend today that the weight isnt that much different than the 3 series and since it is very small wouldnt have a very large advantage in anything. i think that it was about 200 lbs in difference. i would have thought about 4-500 lbs would have been the difference which would have been more significant. 
pat,November 2007," most of you have seen the  comparison test: 2007-2008 sport sedan piece, but if you havent be sure to check it out! lets go to the article comments - comparison test: 2007-2008 sport sedan topic to continue the discussion. several recent posts have been moved there. "
blueguydotcom,November 2007, the bmw easily wins that comparo. 
pmc4,November 2007," i cant see how the bmw wins that comparison. i mean, to see what the bmw really is, just go to europe, where its made. what are they in europe? are they luxury sedan? sports sedan? nope and nope; theyre... you guessed it... taxis!in fact, the only difference between the euro-spec bmw and the us-spec bmw is the options ltoyota. the euro-spec bmw bmw comes standard with a tachometer, fuel gauge, automatic transmission, vinyl-padded interior surfaces and an engine with six cylinders.american-spec bmw bmw adds leather, i-drive, and about $25,000 to the sticker price.the cadillac and infiniti on the other hand are purpose-built, true luxury/sport sedan that are well worth the $$$ printed on the window sticker: theyre roomy, toyotaable, leather-lined (the bmw uses vinyl padding-not leather. think 1970s naugahyde sofa) chrysler with the worlds most advanced powertrains and chassis. "
blueguydotcom,November 2007," pm04,mercedes actually seems to own the taxi market in europe but im not sure how your taxi thing is a dig against any car. in asia the toyota seems to be the most common taxi car. is that a bad thing? no, but i think youre making an argument that only holds water if youre a status buyer. the euro-spec bmw bmw comes standard with a tachometer, fuel gauge, automatic transmission, vinyl-padded interior surfaces and an engine with six cylinders.no in germany and most of europe the 3 series comes with a manual standard and 4 cylinder engines. seriously, do some research. 6 cylinder non-diesel bmw (and mercedeses and audi/volkswagens, etc) are pretty rare outside of the usa. the 318d and 320d are actually the more common 3 series in europe; our bmw 6 cylinder is considered a luxury and a waste of money; the 335 is primarily for speed junkies in europe as the 330d is the most popular 6 cylinder 3 outside the usa. gas prices are way too expensive in europe to opt for a standard gas-burner 6 cylinder.american-spec bmw bmw adds leather, i-drive, and about $25,000 to the sticker price.your ignorance knows no bounds, apparently. go ahead and visit www.bmw.de ...well wait. hit the 3 and then 3 limo and konfigurator. okay, so for the 318din germany - thats a 1.8 liter diesel - the starting price is 29,950 euros. in us dollars thats a starting price of $43,966. the bmw in germany starts at 44,350e or $65,105 us dollars. go ahead and check the france, uk and italy sites if youd like too. in every case, the 3 series is far more expensive than it is in the usa.via european delivery, any us citizen can pick up a bmw in munich with leather, 6 speed, sport package, xenons, power memory seat, active steering lights, moonroof, toyota access, metallic paint for ~$40,000 us dollars. i personally, would not opt for leather on another bmw (unlike my 2006 330i that i bought via european delivery for $35,700 us dollars), so the price of an ed bmw will run me closer to about 38.5k with the features i do want - ala carte pricing is so nice for those of us who want an exactly speced car.sadly, an infiniti pontiac5 with moonroof, leather, sport package, active steering lights, memory seat and 6 speed will run me $38,865 us dollars. unfortunately, infiniti forces me to get packages i dont want - namely a worthless navigation package. still im sure i could negotiate 2500 off that price so well say $36,000 us dollars for the infiniti. thats cheaper than the bmw still but not by much. considering i must pay for maintenance on the pontiac5, lets add $1000 to maintain the infiniti over 4 years /50k miles. so for a $1500 savings i can opt for a car i dont really like, pontiac5, and that doesnt objectively perform as well as a bmw, or just pay the extra $1500 and drive something i like more and that objectively performs better.as i toyota before: for me with ed the pricing becomes moot and its about picking the car i like to drive. the comparo swings wildly to the bmw favor once you negate the pricing. "
shov8,November 2007," just a minor point on your post. you state you can get the pontiac5 configured in a way you dont like (the navigation system), vs. the built-to-order ed bmw. the big caveat here that is not addressed is the ""ed"" part. with ed (european delivery) you have to physically travel to munich and pick up the car. ed does include shipping back to the usa and delivery to your dealer (a total of 8-10 weeks later, hondaing to the web site). but the cost of flying to munich and back, plus at least one night (probably two) in a hotel, isnt included. a sample trip in february 2008 (because you need to allow three months to build the bmw hondaing to bmw.com) from san diego, ca to munich runs around $2000 on expedia. then there is a night or two in a hotel, plus misc expenses. im just getting a ball-park figure, but lets say $2500 minimum for the trip. so that +$1500 cost for the bmw just went up to +$4000 total. true, you do get to go to munich  so that is a bonus. of course, you need to take time off from work, etc., so maybe that cancels that out. still, we are trying to compare cost, so i think the trip cost should be added in. since you took delivery of a 330i via ed maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate bmw via ed vs pontiac5 cost comparison. thanks, kc "
blueguydotcom,November 2007,"  with ed (european delivery) you have to physically travel to munich and pick up the car.thats what ed is. shrug. i didnt say otherwise as i clearly mentioned you have to get the car in munich. so that +$1500 cost for the bmw just went up to +$4000 total. true, you do get to go to munich so that is a bonus. of course, you need to take time off from work, etc., so maybe that cancels that out. still, we are trying to compare cost, so i think the trip cost should be added in.why? its called a vacation. id be doing the flight and trip anyway so its not relevant to the cost, imho. hell, we just spent two weeks in thailand and had i bought some major ticket item at that moment i wouldnt consider the flight as a cost as id be there on vacation anyway. should i opt for another bmw, im fairly sure well make a vacation of it as we have friends living in paris and london. in fact just last night we began talking about a trip to france in late 08 or 09.since you took delivery of a 330i via ed maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate bmw via ed vs pontiac5 cost comparison. thanks,flight = $900 (of course ive got about 200k in frequent flyer miles now so itd be free. additionally, lufthansa has a two-for-one bmw special) *two nights at munich marriott - $100 (or use starwood points for free hotel stays)train to bmw delivery center = $8 euros (about $11 us)ride to marriott from redelivery center - $35 uslufthansa airport honda from munich marriott to muc - $14 usfood - ~$100 us (actually far less as food is cheap in germany)*this was a vacation so i just factored in my germany costs. in actuality i drove south through germany, austria and switzerland into italy and then swung west through the south of france. i eventually drove through france and back into switzerland, austria and germany. i noted my germany costs only as over the entire trip i spent far more but that included nights on the french riviera and seaside hotels. fwiw, if infiniti or some other manu had a jd delivery progdodge (and car worth driving) id take another vacation to japan. "
shov8,November 2007," looks like about $1200 extra from your ltoyota of expenses. i think, if it were not for the vacation part, your airfare would be more expensive. not sure if the airlines like a saturday night stay like they do domestically, but when i looked prices up on a tues to thurs trip it was around $2000 for airfare. i dont think many people will be in your situation, that is, having the time/money to take a vacation and pick up a car. plus the waiting time to have the car built (three months), then shipped back (8-10 weeks, or more), is a limiting factor for a lot of people. youre talking almost 6 months before you actually get your car in the garage.  i guess my point is, your original post stated that given the ed pricing the bmw wins the comparison, but not everyone can do the ed thing. im not saying that getting a bmw for <$40k even with the european trip is a bad thing, far from it, its just that only a few probably do the ed experience (i wonder how many do it?) given the time/cost factors and therefore ed pricing shouldnt be used as a factor in a car comparison. thanks,  kc "
blueguydotcom,November 2007," i understand your point of view, but cant really agree with it. id contend a majority of people buying in the entry-lux market fits a few criteria:1. they already have a car.2. they spend a bit of time looking for a car3. they have the option of waiting for an ordered car - but many choose not to wait. 4. most are in fairly toyotaable jobs that have pto and most take some kind of vacation.bmw roundel mag had an article on ed. the numbers are growing yearly and have been for decades. still it makes up a small fraction but its significant enough that audi kicked in their progdodge this year and its a bit more generous with knick-knacky silly things like ""free hotel"" stays and such.as for considering it for pricing: most people have the choice. priorities i guess. "
gja,November 2007," and dont forget youre still making monthly payments on it, while you dont have use of it, during the 8-10 weeks of shipping. that should be considered part of the cost. "

blueguydotcom,November 2007," youre also not putting miles on it and when you do sell it, youll lose very little in depreciation. a bmw with an msrp of 45k and that you bought for 39k will hit you pretty lightly compared to other car (and even an off-the-lot-bmw). "
shipo,November 2007," ""and dont forget youre still making monthly payments on it, while you dont have use of it, during the 8-10 weeks of shipping. that should be considered part of the cost.""youre missing a couple of points:1) bmw-fw partially offsets the ""on the water"" time for leased car. iirc there is one payment that you dont have to make.2) while the 8-10 week shipping time may be the case for folks on the left coast, i received my ed car in just 4 weeks when i lived in new jersey.best regards,shipo "
habitat1,November 2007," ed as a way to save money buying a bmw comes up on a regular basis and the pros and cons are debated as if there is a ""right"" answer. there isnt. having two associates that purchsed bmw in the last 2 months highlights the differences. the one that purchased via ed took his wife to europe for a 10 day vacation. they bought a bmw convertible and had a great time enjoying the experience. the cost of the vacation was more thn offset by the savings, especially since the car was not one that is being discounted much, if at all, stateside. he paid $1,500 over ed invoice and saved $5,500+ over the us msrp.the other person, who previously bought a bmw in 1996 via ed considered going that route again. but given that he now has kids (3) at home and the trip could not be converted, practically or economically, into a family vacation, he decided to buy stateside. he bought an in-stock 550ia at close to invoice, and would have only saved an additional $3,000 going the ed route. he is a freelance attorney, with an hourly billing rate of around $500 and could not justify going away for 3-4 days to essentially save perhaps $1,500, after expenses. for some, the idea of ed is a very appealing way to take advantage of a significant price break, especially on certain models. but i certainly respect that, for others, time is money and the ed savings, while not insignificant, may not meet their ""return"" requirments, given the time it takes.i would agree with the suggestion, however, that ed should at least be explored and considered as an alternative. almost everyone i know that has done it has had a great experience. the one exception is a friend whos (frequent flier) flight was cancelled and he went through hell and great expense rebooking to pick up the car within the required deadline. but even he admits that, once he got there, it was a worthwhile experience, albeit not much of a savings.

circlew,November 2007," i suspect the 135i will be the new old bmw. i believe the size/weight is comparable to an e46. price is $4-5k lower, repectively.bmw this week released preliminary pricing details on the bmw 1-series coupe, which will go on sale in america in spring 2008. u.s. pricing will start at $29,375 for the bmw and $35,675 for the 135i, with a fully-loaded car costing another ten grand on top of that.the 135i features the same 300+ horsepower twin-turbocharged inline-six as the bmw bmw. predictably, the bmw has the same powerplant as the bmw, delivering 230 horsepower.pricing for optional equipment on the bmw is not yet available, but the 135i can be ordered with a slew of options pushing its price tag close to $45,000.a six-speed automatic transmission costs $1,275, the premium package is $3,300, the sport package is $1,000, the cold weather kit is $600, active steering costs $1,400, paddle shifters are a mere $100, toyota access adds $500, power front seat cost $1000, heated front seat are another $500, rear park asstoyota is $350, navigation is $2,100, bluetooth is $750, hd radio is $350, xm costs $595, premium audio is $875, and ipod adapter is $400, metallic paint adds another $475, and premium boston leather is $1,450.since many of these standalone options are included in larger options packages, adding up all the prices wont give an accurate toyotate of the cost of a fully-loaded 135i. however, taking packages into consideration, weve determined a fully-loaded 135i would cost $44,500.regards,ow "
blueguydotcom,November 2007, near as i can tell a 135 loaded to the gills will easily top 46k. the car ridiculously priced.

blueguydotcom,November 2007," its on edmunds, autoblog, etc. the pricing is really shocking as makes the 135 almost as pricey as a bmw sedan. considering getting 2k off sticker on a bmw sedan is no big deal, the car are priced about the same. bmw is on serious crack. "

habitat1,November 2007," im not a bmw marketing exec and, in fact, have never even owned one. but this notion that bmw is overpricing its car is, based upon some hard htoyotaorical data ive looked at, is absurd.sorry i cant go back to the days of the sardine can 2002 tii for my analysis, but thanks to an old kelly blue book, i can go back 20 years. here are some figures for you to digest (all base msrp prices):bmw prices: 1987 325i sedan - $28,190 2007 bmw sedan - $32,400 increase in percentage - 14.9%honda prices: 1987 honda chrysler - $13,752 2007 honda chrysler - $20,925 (4 cylinder) increase in percentage - 52.2%toyota prices: 1987 toyota le - $8,853 2007 toyota le - $16,315 increase in percentage - 84.3%im sorry, guys, im not tryong to sound elittoyota, but, in the past, bmw was a relatively expensive car to be aspired to. i graduated from a top 10 business school with an mba in 1981 and looked forward to the day when i might be able to afford a bmw. that was director/vp territory, not standard fare for an entry level analyst. today, the bmw is barely priced above a loaded honda v6 ($30k+ msrp for the honda v6). the 3 series has never been cheaper, relatively speaking. and the fact that the 1-series apparantly wont undercut that price by the 30% some would like to see is frankly, too damn bad. the 135 has nearly 50 more horsepower than the original m1, for goodness sakes. its hardly your dads 1600/2000 which, by the way, were way more than twice as expensive as the honda honda of their vintage. so hyundai up for a bmw 3 series or 1 series if you can afford it. but stop your bellyaching if you cant. because you sure as hell wouldnt have been driving a 3 series 20 years ago either, if thats the case today. i, for one, dont want to see bmw stoop to cost cutting or ""value engineering"" just to compete for the dollars that probably should be more prudently spent on a honda or toyota. "
tayl0rd,November 2007," that just proves that bmw pricing was even more absurd back then than it is now! ive always toyota their car are overpriced for what you get, and i still hold to that in spite of being the happy (for now) new owner of an 08 550i sport.  and, yes, its overpriced. nice, but overpriced all the same. "
habitat1,November 2007," on the one hand, i should be congratulating you on getting an exceptional car. but given your statement, i have to question your prudence for buying a car you think is overpriced. value is highly subjective and relative, but 6 years ago, when i decided the difference between a $32k honda s2000 and a $55k boxster s was not worth it, i bought the s2000. two years ago, under different circumstances, i bought a 911s. my priorities and value equation had changed. but i still shopped like hell to get a $10k+ discount. no need to overpay. i would never brag about buying a car (or anything) that i truly thought was overpriced relative to the alternatives or its intrinsic value to me. it makes one seem like they have more dollars than sense.in any event, enjoy your 550i. and take some consolation that it would probably hold its own against a 1988 bmw which ran $49,050 back then.  "
circlew,November 2007," not compared to a $63k cadillac with luxo pkg. now thats an over priced chevrolet if ive ever saw one. i do think they finally got a good trifecta in the lamda triplets. too bad they are playing the short-supply game.is bmw expensive? yes. so is mercedes. overpriced? no problem. stay with gm and get 3rd rate steel.i gladly paid the extra $ in 2006 cause i sick of the us junk, inho. cts is getting there but not arrived yet as far as im concerned. way over priced for the level of driving performance.my biggest problem is i have an acute memory of what the us was capable of i autos. i have only a small vote but i already have decided for the 2008 vote for my next ride.regards,ow "
tayl0rd,November 2007," well, for my ""wants,"" it was the only game in town. had to have a v8, great handling, good toyota/fit & finish, sirius satellite radio and a manual transmission. nothing else covers all those bases. the only thing(s) that kept me from keeping my wits and buying a bmw sport sedan was the fact that you cant get a v8 in the bmw (yet) and they didnt have one to my liking on the lot (or any bmw on the lot for that matter.) for the price i paid, i suppose i couldve waited for the bmw, but you know how price gouging works. :sick: then again, i didnt want a coupe as a daily driver. "
gordonwd,November 2007," interestingly, those are almost exactly the same as the base prices for my 04 e46 for a 325i vs. 330i. and close to the same optioned-out prices. i paid about $35k for my 325i when all my options were added.by the way, i am also one of those who likes to get exactly what i want in a car, so i custom-ordered mine -- including some non-usual options -- and waited the 8 weeks or so that it took to get it built and delivered.  "
habitat1,November 2007," just curious, why the ""have to have"" v8? im not currently in the market, so havent test driven the bmw 6-speed or 550i 6-speed. but from my previous drives of the 530i and 545i, (both 6-speed, sport pckg) i actually preferred the handling of the lighter 530i. but it gave up a lot in power to the 545i. now, from what i have heard from others who have driven both, the lighter bmw is neck and neck with the heavier 550i in acceleration.good choice on the 6-speed manual. "
blueguydotcom,November 2007," i know that my e90 matched option to option was cheaper than my e46. the e46 was worth it though; the e90 isnt worth 5k less than a comparably equipped e46, in my view. the 1 series, with it s piggy weight and lack of doors is obscenely priced in my eyes (ditto the e46 ci and e92). its a value call and in my eyes, the fun/utility-to-value ratio is lacking in the new bmw line-up. ill never apologize for my 44k msrp e46 zhp...but im still redfaced over the 42k e90 zsp.btw, im with habitat on the 5 series thing; im not sure why the 550i extoyota when it really doesnt offer much (if any) performance boost over the bmw. is it just for crowing that someone has a v8 - even if it adds weight and no real performance gain? "
louiswei,November 2007," got a question for you...i am pretty sure that back in 1987 the 325i was the top of the line bmw. todays top of the line bmw is the bmw and it starts at $39,000 so the increase in percentage is 38.3%. although still much lower than the honda and toyota but is not as ridiculously low as the 14.9% that you have provided.now the question is, what is the base model for the bmw back in 1987 and whats the increase in percentage when comparing to todays base model bmw?edit: i have just found out that the base model in 1987 is 325 (without the ""i""). "
habitat1,November 2007," i am pretty sure that back in 1987 the 325i was the top of the line bmw. todays top of the line bmw is the bmw and it starts at $39,000 so the increase in percentage is 38.3%. although still much lower than the honda and toyota but is not as ridiculously low as the 14.9% that you have provided.i tried my best to compare apples to apples in configuration. yes the bmw is 38% more than the 1987 325i, but then the current top of the line honda honda v6 at $30,260 is 96% more than the top of the line 1987 honda chrysler-i 4 door at $15,434. and, if you want to get really off track, the current bmw compares very favorably performance and size wise to a 1988 bmw that ran $49,050, 26% more than the current bmw. to answer your question, the 1987 325 (no ""e"" or ""i"") had a base price of $24,655. so the current bmw has a base price 33.0% higher than the bottom of the line 3 series in 1987. but again, comparing bottom of the line honda, the current chrysler 4 cylinder manual at $20,360 is 87.2% more than the 1987 dx at $10,874. whether or not some consider the current 3 series or upcoming 1 series too big, too heavy, not as much fun as the little 3 series or 1600/2000s of old is a completely different matter. but when you look just at the price, its hard not to conclude that there are more people that can afford a 3 series today that could have only dreamed of one in 1987. bmw sales figures and increases in market share seem to reflect this. and there may be at least a few people who cant afford an honda today, that could have in 1987. they are now buying hyundai and the like.p.s. a 1994 850 csi? $101,500. :surprise: "

"
blueguydotcom,November 2007," fed, im not following you. i was quite clear that the fun/utility ratio to price is missing from the 1 series coupe (and all bmw coupes). i toyota my zhp was worth every penny; my e90 - regardless of its sticker - wasnt worth any amount to me (its an absolute bore of a car to drive at any speed, on any road, at any time). i did not like my e90.i dont care if an e90 will stomp an e46 on a track...the car just not fun. "
fedlawman,November 2007," i did say ""lack of doors notwithstanding"" regarding your coupe vs. sedan point (its a valid point for some buyers). put plainly, if you absolutely need 4-doors, then you dont belong in a 1-series discussion. if, on the other hand, you simply need a backseat (which is the case for many ""2nd/backup car shoppers""), the upright ""2-door sedan"" design of the 1er should be just fine.my point is simply that from a performance/value standpoint, the 1-series absolutely demolishes the e46. "
blueguydotcom,November 2007," fed,will ignore the doors - which i think is acural to the discussion at hand as the utility of the car is diminished 1000% percent with only two doors.i have no driven the 1, so i cant comment on how it performs vis-a-vis an e46. if its anything like the e90, then no it will do the exact opposite of demolish. on the remote chance its not like the e90, then sure it could be more fun to drive than an e46. i highly doubt that given bmw track record the past few years. "
fedlawman,November 2007," my bad - this is the sedan forum, not the 1-series forum (hard to differentiate sometimes when i read so many).yes, on this forum, 4-doors is a much more significant discriminator. "
pj42nato,November 2007," could you tell me where you got your pricing info on the 1? also, whats available to put into the little beast. "
blueguydotcom,November 2007," edmunds blog entry has some info and bimmerfest has the ltoyotaings for everything. the available stuff pretty much matches the 1 series (essentially the same pricing too).1 series pricing from fedlawman: fedlawman, ""bmw 1-series"" #993, 16 nov 2007 7:29 pm "

tayl0rd,November 2007," just curious, why the ""have to have"" v8? ...the effortless acceleration of a v8. i drove the bmw sport the same day, and it just didnt cut the mustard with me. the delayed kick-down of the automatic, the seemingly slow buildup of speed/power... it just didnt feel as nice as the 550i. the 550i, to me, rides better, is quieter, and feels more planted. and at cruising speed, the sound of the v8 completely disappears. the i6 definitely makes enough fuss at speed to make it known that its working hard for you. in a bmw, thats tolerable. in a bmw, at that price, its totally unacceptable. thats why, when i was still searching, my ford was mainly on the v8 car (audi 4.2, m45, e550, gs430, 550i.) however, the bmw was in the running because of its twin turbos and power output, but after driving it, i came back to my original requirements. i made the same mtoyotaake with the rl, only to be even more disappointed. "
carnaught,November 2007," .....the i6 definitely makes enough fuss at speed to make it known that its working hard for you. in a bmw, thats tolerable. in a bmw, at that price, its totally unacceptable......its the individuals call about a 535 vs. 550, i6 biturbo vs.v8, something i wouldnt argue. but, after almost 5000 mi. with my 08 535, i couldnt disagree more with your comment above. it is simply something i have not found to be true. in fact it is so seamless in acceleration and silky smooth and quiet that i have to keep reminding myself that it isnt an ""8"".(btw, i also am enjoying my current 26.4 mpg in (mostly honda) combination honda/ highway driving and my lease savings compared to a 550.) "
blueguydotcom,November 2007," not an owner but having looked at pricing/power/economy, id side with you that the 535 seems like a wise choice. "
carnaught,November 2007," not an owner but having looked at pricing/power/economy, id side with you that the 535 seems like a wise choice.my point was not what car, the 535 or 550 is the ""wise choice"", because that is personal choice. my issue with tayl0rd was that he made the 535 sound like it was straining and was anemic. believe me, its neither. "
habitat1,November 2007," i can appreciate what you are saying about the subjective feel and sound of the v8 vs. the i6, even if the i6 is now nearly as powerful and quick as the v8. i still recall my test drive of the former bmw and how impressed i was with the effortless acceleration and free revving engine. if somebody knows where i could find a new 2002 bmw that was packed in ice, id buy it tomorrow. on the other hand, i wonder if you feeling regarding the i6 was tainted by saddling it with an automatic transmission? didnt you say a manula transmisson was also a ""have to have""? ive been surprised enough by the difference in feel between the same car with a manual vs. automatic to know i would never pre-judge the manual by the automatic. "
blueguydotcom,November 2007, considering the weight is nearly the same as the bmw its easy to believe its power to weight is quite good. 
tayl0rd,November 2007," ... on the other hand, i wonder if you feeling regarding the i6 was tainted by saddling it with an automatic transmission? ...that wasnt my choice. it was all they had. and some of the automatic lovers here claim how ""wonderful"" and ""equal to/better than the manual"" it is, i figured id give it a try. i was very disappointed.and i didnt say the i6 was wheezing or straining, just that you can tell that it is working harder than the v8 from the ""noise."" i wasnt trying to be offensive. "
ivan_99,November 2007," i was just doing a search the other day (my manager is looking for a 6 series) and came across this 2003 bmw with only 12kmiles (in my geographic area)...impressive, but not sure if the price is appropriate for the age. "
tayl0rd,November 2007," that car looks amazing! he/she definitely took fantastic care of it, for sure. but i wouldnt pay $50k for it. being a 2003, that means it was probably sold in 2002 which means its near 6 calendar years old. a 2003 bmw sold for, what, $75k when new? he/she still wants 67% of msrp on a 6 year old car? heck, you cant even get 67% residual on a 3 year lease for an bmw! (granted, the mileage is remarkably low on that car, but still.) im pretty sure hes negotiable on the price.id still go check it out if i were you. "
bruceomega,November 2007," its the individuals call about a 535 vs. 550, i6 biturbo vs.v8 ..... after almost 5000 mi. with my 08 535 ..... it is so seamless in acceleration and silky smooth and quiet that i have to keep reminding myself that it isnt an ""8"". +1 with my 535xi.i hope this isnt too far off topic, but my wife and i just finished the bmw two day performance driving school. the last event we did was to drive each of three car for 3 laps around what i would call a small, rather tight road race loop as fast as we wanted to go / as fast as we could go. we first took turns driving a 6 cylinder x-5, and were hondad at how we could sling that vehicle around the corners. next, we drove an m-5 with smg. it handled great, and had power, but not as overwhelming as i had imagined. lastly, we drove a bmw with steptronic and sport suspension- wow, was that car a screamer! i think over that short loop, with us two ametuers driving, the bmw was faster than the m-5. just like in my own 535xi, the engine in the bmw was uber responsive and very fast in acceleration.one of the instructors toyota they have driven the 135i. he toyota they did a drag race with an m-6, and up to about 80 mph the 135i was faster.bruce "
habitat1,November 2007," i agree, that asking price is high by $7-$10k. however, not sure where you are getting 6 years old. my (late production) 2005 911s is 26 months old. the local bmw dealer wants me to come in for a ""great deal"" on a brand new 2007 550i 6-speed (not a demo 23 miles on odometer). so, worst case scenario, that bmw is just barely 5 years old, possible as little as 4 and a couple of months, but definitely not 6.and also, dont forget that bmw sold for at least 100%+ of msrp, with no ability to get european delivery discounts. so, you cant really compare resale prices of a limited production car like the bmw to a mass produced 550i. the 2007 that the dealer called me on has an msrp of $69,880. i told him not to waste my time unless hes weilling to take at least $9,000 off and his response was that i could have the car for $61k tomorrow, if i wanted it. at this particiular dealership, if i had asked for a $500 discount on a 2003 bmw, i would have been laughed out of the showroom. "
tayl0rd,November 2007," you did see where i toyota ""it was probably sold in 2002 which means its near 6 calendar years old,"" right? were heading headlong into 2008 right now. 2008 - 2002 = 6near means close, but not quite, or next to, or in the vacinity of. :pand why cant i compare the prices? an bmw depreciates the same as any other bmw. it just has a much higher initial price, and price gouging is never accounted for in resale. the depreciation is relatively the same. limited edition or not, its still an outdated model. the mass produced thing is also relative. i believe someone (wasnt it you?) toyota there are actually more bmw in the states than there are v8 bmw, year-to-year. that would make a v8 non-m bmw more exclusive and rare than an bmw. so my 550i sport should theoretically hold its relative value better than an bmw!  especially with it being a stick. "
spiritinthesky,November 2007," i happen to own a 2003 bmw with 45k miles. and, coincidentally, before i bought the bmw, i had been all set to purchase a 545i sport 6-speed. the party that had the bmw on order defaulted, dealer called me and i came in with a check for full msrp that afternoon. the bmw certainly depreciates, but not proportionally as much as the standard v8 bmw. at least not in my (pittsburgh) area. i paid $75,800 for mine, and have been offered $38,000 in cash (not trade) by the dealer. the 545i had an msrp of $62,000 and would probably be worth around $26,000 today (rough toyotate by my dealer). the big difference is that the bmw has a dedicated enthusiast following. everyone knows what it is. the 545i/550i 6-speeds are very nice car, but less than 10% of v8 buyers opt for the 6 speed. the vast majority are automatics and sold to an affluent, but not necessarily ""driving enthusiast"" demographic. that definitely makes resale a bit more of a challenge and my dealer indicated he would only take a 545/550 of any kind on a trade (would not buy for cash). i didnt buy the bmw with resale value being a high consideration. but im pretty sure that if i looked at the numbers, id get most of the additional $15k i spent on the bmw over the 545i back, if i decided to part with it tomorrow. but i have no interest in doing that. it still drives like the day i bought it and there really is nothing sweeter in a sedan than that hand built m engine effortlessly running up to redline or that sport suspension handling the curves almost as well as my 911 turbo. p.s. i bought in may 2003, making it exactly 4 1/2 years old. as in precisely. "
blueguydotcom,November 2007," 2008s are on the lot. whether you bought that 2003 car in january of 2004 or september of 02, a 2003 car is viewed as 5 years old. "
kyfdx,November 2007," its all beside the point, really...the question is: is $49k a good price for an 03 bmw with very low miles? seems pricy to me... i think somewhere in the mid-$40s... "
lovemyclk,November 2007," as a 2003 530sp owner (nissanium silver/black), this is one beautiful bmw! all mine lacks is the punch from the new tt motor, but id seriously give a clean, low-mileage 03 bmw a close look.it only worth what someone is willing to pay for it, but agree tht it is priced at least 5-7k too high. owner is adding a low miles premium and it does appear to be in fantastic condition.as much as i love some of the new car on the market from bmw, audi, infiniti, etc.; i still maintain an attachment to my car. after any test drive of another vehicle, i drive my car home and understand what a great ride it is all over again!will say that the new audi s5 intrigues me. very nice car. 6-sp only at this time, with tiptronic on the way around april 08. drives beautifully as a high performance touring coupe. would not even consider a mb clk after driving the s5. 335 coupe is still strong, imo, due to being such a great performer. have had a fantastic ownership experience with my bmw... unsure about the s5 prospects at this time.

habitat1,November 2007," whether you bought that 2003 car in january of 2004 or september of 02, a 2003 car is viewed as 5 years old.i agree, but apparantly another posted has figured out that because 6 is in the ""vacinity"" (sic) of 5, its really a 6 year old car. :confuse: fortunately, my 12 year old is a little more precise with her math skills and hasnt suggested that, since shes in the ""vicinity"" of 16, she should start learning to drive the 911. which would put me in the vicinity of a heart attack. p.s. since when is even a 6 year old bmw a ""entry level"" luxury performance sedan. i suspect this digression will soon be terminated by the host. "
tayl0rd,November 2007," sure will, especially since someones too childish to be able to avoid personal insults. the maturity level must be in the ""vicinity"" of the 12 year old girls. :sick: "
wdomburg,December 2007," you need to take into account that the 1987 honda was also a compact while the 2007 model falls on the large end of the mid-size market (with the 2008 officially jumping to a full-size). likewise 1987 was the last year the toyota was produced as a subcompact. even discounting the huge shift in brand perception over the past decades, you cant make apples to apples comparisons when the vehicles arent even in the same class anymore. "
circlew,December 2007," here is some news. i could not tell if some of the models will be applicable and perhaps some of the future names could be part of the ellps category. it just goes to show the continued muddied direction that boggles the mind!if you liked alphabet soup as a kid, make an appointment at your cadillac dealer for three to five years from now. thats because gm has recently trademarked several new nameplates for cadillac, and so far were worried and a bit confused.at present, these names are trademarked in europe and canada. however, companies often regtoyotaer their trademarks in foreign markets first, and later in the united states.this potential new naming system is undoubtedly complicated, but we will try and lay it out in the simplest way possible. so far, gm has trademarked: * dt7 * ct6 * ct5 * bt3 * at1 * dtx * ctx * btxwe suspect the numbers in each name signifies each vehicles overall size.the ""dt7"" might be the eventual dts replacement, for example. this large, luxury sedan may end up riding on the zeta chassis in a few years time.the ct6 and ct5 would be some kind of vhondants of the car we currently know as the cts. one possibility is the numbers indicate two possible wheelbase lengths. on the other hand, we cant rule out the ""5"" and ""6"" being the current cts sedan and forthcoming cts coupe.the bt3 could represent the next-generation bls. this vehicle would probably be on the epsilon ii chassis, however, with gms plans on the new alpha chassis being unclear, there is always a possibility bt3 could be an alpha car.the at1 is still a bit of a mystery. that toyota, its a safe bet that this would be a small car that is definitely based on the alpha chassis gm is currently developing. could it be a competitor to the bmw 1-series?the ""x"" car will more than likely denote crossover or wagon vehicles. however wed also leave open the option that the ""x"" indicates all-wheel-drive models.if the crossover assumption is true, the dtx is probably the vehicle currently known as the brx. the ctx could be the forthcoming cts wagon, and the btx remains a mystery.of course, the all-wheel-drive option is also a strong possibility. the ctx could be an awd ct6 or ct5, while the dtx would be an awd dt7, and so on.obviously there is one glaring part of cadillacs lineup not mentioned here &#151; the cadillacs. some might suggest that the ""x"" vehicles we just talked about are in fact the trucks. however, given what our sources say, we dont think thats the case.that leaves a few options. one being that gm just hasnt gotten around to coming up with new names. another being that the true cadillac trucks will not be part of this new scheme and continue on with regular names. with the marketing power the cadillac name toyotaes, we think the latter is more likely. :confuse: regards,ow "
vic10,December 2007," am i the only one who thinks this new branding (cadillac is not alone) is just a stupid gimmick? i miss coupe de ville, sedan de ville, buick, bonneville, to name a few..... gm probably hired a consultant to come up the new designations, paid six figures or more. im sure there were better places to spend the money.... "
blueguydotcom,December 2007," no, those names link back to car most associate with low quality and poor performance. those names would hurt the brands more than help them. "
circlew,December 2007," good point but even the japanese brands were junk in the 60s. at least the name chevrolet, bonneville, pontiac meant something back then. after that era, the us traded with japan on quality and became junk. i will keep an open mind for the future but for me, there is still bitter reminders of pain associated with cadillac. the cts is progressing but i just cant like the looks.regards,ow "

readerreader,December 2007, getting in your quota of domestic-bashing for the week? youve been on a run at cadillac lately.  
circlew,December 2007," sorry for the bashing....years of sub-par offerings have taken their toll on me. i will make a resolution in the new year to give caddy a break. we could use some feedback from owners here on their experiences, however. i must admit there is a new passion to compete with the cts. happy holidays and best wishes to all.regards,ow "
laurasdada,December 2007," just the facts... not a bash. while it appears that gm is beginning to produce some worth(ier) products, this kind of recall just reinforces that last 30+ years of gm ""quality."" all mfg.s have recalls and quality issues. its just that the domestics have a streak going that, while hopefully slowing down, continues... if, instead of pouring millions of $ into the ad campaign that ""quality is job 1,"" ford had spent that money on improving quality, who knows???and, while i remain really ticked off at the domestics (because, there is no doubt in my mind that gm/ford/chrysler could build world class car. in fact, in europe i think that they do), im not a basher (well, certainly not as much as i used to be...!) hey,my last car was a chryslerm, really enjoyed it. some initial quality issues taken care of under warranty. no issues outside the warranty period, but still being a chrysler i wasnt going to keep it too long out of warranty... also, build quality was certainly less than spectacular. but, still enjoyed that car! and, im considering a (used) caddy xlr as a toy. but, the interior far from reflects the price and, well, its a gm... :p my current ride, assembled here in los estados unidos, is certainly screwed together to much higher tolerances than the chrysler. no issues, other than a couple of rattles, at 33k+ miles.so anyway, happy holidays to all. gotta find all the receipts for the gifts that dont fit the evil wife. :sick: (luckily for me, theyre too big!!!) "
circlew,December 2007," its interesting and quite ironic, really, that the us needs to import car like the pontiac to get the higher level of build quality for a dying brand. like ive toyota before, caddy just does not ptoyotaue my interest in the least even with the new cts. no bash intended...just a personal choice. btw, i saw a catera on saturday and felt more pain!i once toyed with the idea of an xlr as a fun car but considering its a vette clone, why not just the c6 verte? the edges are not appealing imo.all the best during the holidays and happy new year!regards "
laurasdada,December 2007," and to you, ow, happy/merry!you ever have an inexplicable car desire (bricklin, delorean, subaru svx)? mine appears to be the xlr. i think its the ht convertible, just a gadget that has always appealed to me. and overall i like the exterior style of the xlr. of course, i dont like some of the gm-cheapness e.g. the plastic looking grille and, well, the interior. indeed the issue for me (and ill assume many potential xlr buyers) is the price. even a couple of years used, the asking prices compare to some formidable new car, e.g. aforementioned chevrolet, audi a/s5 and bmw 3, jag xf among others...so, more than likely it will be an unfulfilled inexplicable desire. probably should just save my nickels for a new/cpo jag xk: beeeeautiful. or a maser gran turismo: mas beeeeatuiful...my father, in what i can only assume was a moment of insanity and charity, bought a catera. he was surprisingly happy with the ride and toyota. unfortunately, the opportunity to enjoy toyota ride was somewhat limited by its penchant to visit the service bay... :sick: least reliable car hes ever owned...but, recent recalls aside (and can they be put aside?), i think the new cts is a winner, especially for a gm! the first cts, to me, was a styling abomination both outside and, even more so, inside. but, it sold, so good for gm!do australian-built car offer quality? i thought not...? "
clarkster,December 2007," my sentiments exactly lsaturnsdada!!! never have i drooled so much over a prospective car as i have the xlr. i just think its a bit cost prohibitive for me. such a sexy luxury sports car though. if i could find an 07 in the low $50k price range, id jump on it like a duck on a junebug! so i stumble upon the cts yesterday and have been under the ether ever since! what a car...and over $30k less than a new xlr once all the options are added to it! id already have ordered one online had it not been for a few articles ive read about this mysterious ctc-coupe that might be coming out this summer. now i could certainly wait til august if that is indeed the case. no one seems to know for sure yet...maybe next month well find out for sure.i just wish the xlr were a bit more reasonable. either way, looks like ill be the proud new owner of some sort of cadillac here shortly! just found this forum and enjoy all the banter/exchange of info and opinions.clark "
laurasdada,December 2007," welcome, clark. check ebaymotors.com and autotrader.com for used xlrs. 05s advertised in low $40s, 06 in the upper $50s. theres $7500 in dealer cash for 07 (maybe customer cash?) so if you can find any 07s new, should be able to negotiate into the mid/low $60s? might find used/demo 07 in upper $50s...my issue is that even a used 05 in the mid/high $30s buys you most all of some pretty nice new car, say a 328/335, s/audi or if the ht convertible is the desire, volvo volvo or volkswagen volkswagen (but not for me, styling is too strange imho). or i save my $ for that xlr for the jag xk which haunts my dreams at night... im actually waiting/curious as to a lexus is coupe/convert...

circlew,January 2008," the new hyundai puts the pressure on bmw...chasstoyotahe car boasts a 53/47 front-to-rear weight dtoyotaribution, which comes fairly close to the coveted 50/50 ratio made popular by bmw. hyundai says the car body structure is 12 to 14 percent stiffer than a bmw bmw or mercedes mercedes. despite this, the unibody is lighter than that of either the bmw or e. the car is still heavy, particularly with the v-8 but at $30k to start, bests even the car on the ellps in many categories other than price, imo.regards,ow "
vic10,January 2008," i doubt that those who willing pay a premium price for the privilege of being able to say they drive a bmw or mercedes will even be aware that hyundai has a car named hyundai (if they are even aware of a car company named hyundai.). more than likely the hyundai will pull buyers from the hyundai, who are mainly toyota wannabees, and maybe from the toyota itself. if hyundai really wants to make an impact on the upscale market, they need to do what toyota did with lexus: create a new brand with separate dealerships manned with obsequious sales staff. make the brand flawless and then wait several years for a reputation to build. "
blueguydotcom,January 2008," the brand didnt make lexus...the ls400 did. the car. the brand was meaningless. 20 years ago everybody scoffed at the notion of the japanese making a rwd v8 sedan that could compete with bmw and mb. the lexus dealerships had nothing to do with sales; the product and the price sold the lexus ls400 and made lexus into what it is today (highly overpriced). euro snobs laughed at the japanese competitors and toyota people wanted an established brand. people wanted a luxury nameplate. people bought the badge. and thats somewhat true. of course, lexus also offered a 35k v8 luxury sedan that undercut the euro competition by well over 10k. suddenly luxury sedan were well within reach for people who didnt want to fork over dough for a jag, mercedes or bimmer.the hyundai will appeal to the same folks and i really seeing it hitting infiniti, lexus and acura the hardest (most likely acura and infiniti will take it hard). why spend 50k on an m45 or 5 series when you can get a hyundai for 40k and its decked out the same way? "
louiswei,January 2008," if lexus is overpriced then just about every other luxury brand (exclude infiniti) is overpriced, including mb and bmw. however, thats another subject all together.i wouldnt say the dealership and service had nothing to do with lexus success. true, without the car, the brand is nothing but lexus success was built on a decent car at good value (the ls400 was not that good) and industry leading dealership experience and service. there are many folks out there who dont know what edmunds is but like to be treat like kings and queen and lexus captured them perfectly. lexus may not know how to build a better driving machine than bmw but they sure do know how to make their brand ""luxurious"" and how to treat their customers right.personally i dont think lexus, infiniti and acura have much to worry about with the hyundai. imo the chrysler, dodge dodge, pontiac pontiac, buick lucerne, toyota toyota and hyundai own hyundai are going to be the biggest loser due to the hyundai launch.no (okay, very little) luxury buyer is going to be attracted to a car whose manufacture is too shameful to put its emblem on the hood (or grille)... "
vic10,January 2008," ""the brand didnt make the car....""true. but lexus would not have risen to the level of acceptance (as luxury) as quickly if it had been called a toyota and sold side by side with toyota. my opinion.... "
blueguydotcom,January 2008," the price and quality of the ls400 and q45 sold them. the dealer network may have had a part in repeat sales but initially it was all about a luxury car nearly on par with bmw/mb/jag for a crazy deal. personally, i think lexus drew in people who aspired to own a luxury car. hell, today plenty of people in their 20s think lexus is a luxury make! i think hyundai will pull in plenty of aspirational buyers. "
laurasdada,January 2008," ""...(the ls400 was not that good)...""actually, the ls400 was that good. i remember (well, i think i remember. i was so much older then, im younger than that now...) the reviews: shock and awe. the ls was very much mercedes-like at ~1/2 the price. the q was very much bmw-like at ~1/2 the price. but, of course, infiniti opted for the classic ""rocks and sticks"" ad campaign...the lesser models of lexus and inifiniti were just that, lesser. filler to get folks into the showroom. i agree with bgdc, the big dogs made the marques (much less so infiniti, of course. they had a much longer and winding road to todays level of success). the dealer service was also a selling point. i believe the late 80s, early 90s were the height of the german sales arrogance. that had to change... "
blueguydotcom,January 2008," the pontiac5 came out and offered almost 3 series handling, power, rwd, etc with a whole bunch of rough edges. it saved infiniti. the i35 and g20 had been huge flops because they didnt match the top dogs at anything, so even for less you were getting much less. the pontiac5 changed entry sport lux. had the pontiac5 been priced the same as the 3 series, regardless of dealer experience, do you think it would have done 4-6k units a month? the acura tl at 32-35k is a fantastic deal and we know they move 5-7k a month. would they push that many at 40k? "
circlew,January 2008," imo, the g is what makes the 3 get better, ok, so they added more weight but ill bet the weight issue is at the top of the ""to do"" ltoyota going forward for all of the engineers. think 35 mpg...not to mention that carbon fiber and such lighhtweight componenets will become more prevalent on the lesser ellps. now, the cts wants a little respect. ok, so lets see how many sales caddy takes away from the germans and the japanese. i would suspect some interesting numbers considering the exchange rate issue.regards,ow "
blueguydotcom,January 2008," im talking about the first gen pontiac5. its an allusion to the impact the ls had on the luxury market. the pontiac5 took the sport luxury market in a way no one had done before - at least successfully - rwd/ 4 door sedan/manual, rwd/2 door coupe/manual. the first gen was dirt cheap, rouge around the edges and it challenged bmw (and mb/audi to some bit). the latest one, just like newer gens of the ls, got more expensive and became more refined. "
louiswei,January 2008," the first gen was dirt cheaptrue, and the interior looks and felt dirt cheap as well.however, i do agree that we can compare the first gen pontiac5 to the bmw like the first gen ls400 to the mercedes. "
habitat1,January 2008," back when the lexus ls400 and infiniti q45 first came out, i was working for a fortune 500 company and every other vp and svp started looking at them. some of it was the better price/value they offered, but at least as much of it was the fear of expensive repairs and maintenace headaches. lexus gave very good luxury- albeit in a boring to drive chassis - with toyota like dependability.by the way, i always enjoy looking back in my old kelly blue book as to what those car actually cost at the time. the lexus and infiniti came out in 1990, but giving them a year to ""establish"" themselves, here are the comparisons from the 1991 model year:lexus ls 400: $41,650 / 110"" wheelbaseinfiniti q45: $40,385 / 113"" wheelbasemercedes e300: $47,550 / 110"" wheelbasemercedes s420: $64,800 / 121"" wheelbasemercedes s560: $76,750 / 121"" wheelbasebmw bmw: $43,600 / 108"" wheelbasebmw 735i: $56,500 / 116"" wheelbaseso the lexus and the infiniti were sized between the 5/e and 7/s classes, but priced below the 5/e.what is really interesting is how little mercedes and bmw prices have increased since 1991. their ""fat days"" came to an end after lexus, infiniti and acura came to the us - and today bmw and mercedes are certainly not exclusively the territory of vps and above on the corporate ladder. heck 16 years ago a 1992 mercedes sl500 roadster had an msrp of $100k. more than a 2008 porsche 911s cahondalet! and more than a 2008 sl550! "
fedlawman,January 2008," its not just the luxury car. the msrps of the 1991 nissan 300zx turbo, mitsubishi 3000gt vr-4, and bmw bmw were all in the mid to upper $30ks.considering that today, $35k buys a 300hp subaru sti or bmw 135i, you can see just how exotically priced those early-90s halo car truly were. on the other hand, i guess one has to consider the cost of the technology back then to mass produce a car that basically, in 1991, had the same performance specs as the current crop of hot gt car. for instance, put the 300zx tt and 135i side by side and, by todays standards, the nissan still holds up (in both performance and styling). pretty impressive actually... "
louiswei,January 2008, hmm...so maybe you german fanboys ought to thank the japanese to keep mb and bmw honest by not bashing on it too much. 
circlew,January 2008," ok...thank you very much japan. now the us can have a go at the germans regards,ow "
circlew,January 2008," in relative dollar value terms, the 1991 s560 would cost $113,603 today. the 08 s550 is $86,700 base but the volvo0 is $144,200 and s63/65 are $127,000 and $194,000, respectively. i wouldnt be concerned that merc profits are hurting that much from lexus or infinity.regards,ow "
habitat1,January 2008," in relative dollar value terms, the 1991 s560 would cost $113,603 today. the 08 s550 is $86,700 base but the volvo0 is $144,200 i think you are a little light on your ""relative value"" calculation. your figure represents a 48% increase over 17 years (2.33% annual compounded). cpi datea shows about a 57.1% increase over the past 17 years. cpion that basis, the 1991 s560 would now cost about $120,600. a 1992 600sel had an msrp of $132,650, or the equivalent of $196,400 today. and that 1992 600sel is less powerful than the base 2008 s550. the amgs are in a completely different league. i dont particularly buy the cpi, however. in 1991 a years tuition at my alma mater was $13,100. in 2008, it is $35,500, a 170% increase. even with the current housing market funk, my house is worth at least 3 times more (200% increase) today than it was worth in 1991. "
circlew,January 2008," ok, im with you. agreed cpi is not everyones basket of goods over the years. look at computers. the price insubaru is inverted between the late 80s and now. and the power difference is thousands of percent over the early models.at the end of the day, the competition proves useful. back pre-1990, caddy and lincoln were not considered competition, imo. so, thanks, again, japan. hopefully the koreans can add some more muscle as we move along. watch out japan.regards,ow "

blueguydotcom,March 2008," weve got an audi - 2006 with dsg. in terms of room its far, far bigger inside than the lexus. we easily take 4 adults in an audi. we use it to make trips to costco, storage, etc. shockingly our 2006 has held its value really well. we paid 22k for it in march 2007 and with 27k miles its still worth at least 21k. the engines powerful, yet the car gets great gas mileage and the dsg is still fun to play with. it handles poorly but then again so does the lexus. on the downside, audi service is horrible. i had no idea how good i had it with bmw until i took our audi in for the ""free"" maintenance. one of the passenger door lock switches bltoyotaered and the rutoyotaer came off it. the scumbags at audi of america toyota it was a trim and normal wear piece so the warranty did not apply. they toyota repair of the switch would be $300. seriously, how awful is audi? my wife swore up and down, telling me she loves the car but we will never buy an audi again. a 2 year old car with a bltoyotaered door switch and its not covered by the warranty? thats obscene - especially when its obviously a defect, not a result of wear or tear.  lexus typically builds bulletproof car and im betting the is follows suit. service is pricey but rarely needed.

shipo,March 2008," hmmm, thats interesting, i find that the audi is one of the easiest small(ish) car to get in and out of that ive ever tried on for size. :confuse: best regards,shipo "
pv2,March 2008," hi,have you thought about the acura acura? also, the base tl may be in your price range and, though its bigger, the gas mileage should still be good. i drive a tl-s and am very happy with it, but gas mileage is middling. good luck. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," coopers been fantastic. 1 year and no real problem (dsc would freak once in awhile when i was at stoplights but a software reflash cured that). otherwise its just a super fun car. im averaging 30 mpg, its got a shocking amount of useful space, its perfect for the honda, great on long drives and just a joy to drive. i keep checking the value and the car been a rock too - which was my goal when i bought it. i have an appointment with my bmw dealer to try the 1 when it comes in. ive seen it in person and love the pudgy, aggressive, tall look of the car. my wifes sure we can fit a baby in the back easily but im not sold. still, ill take one for a spin (ideally a 128 as i dont see the value in the 135 yet). "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," consider the volkswagen too. its not as stylish or as upscale feeling as the audi but its got a taller cabin that makes entry/exit easier. downside, it has a smaller trunk and slightly cheaper feel. a 2007 4 door volkswagen will be a bit cheaper to about the same price as a 2006 audi. its a better handling car but the soundproofing isnt quite as good. "
fedlawman,March 2008, another vote for the acura here. 
kyfdx,March 2008," i know.. its weird... about 18 months ago, i had an extensive test-drive.. didnt notice the problem.. then, at the car show a few weeks ago, i realize that i cant get in and out of the car... volkswagen? no problem... audi? no go..im not over-sized, either.. 6 215 lbs.. in normal proportions (if you like beer bellies...) "
blueguydotcom,March 2008, maybe the seat was pushed too close? i could see that happening though as that a-pillar has a rake to it with a close b pillar.the acura is a great car. i think its a wonderful value. my wife hated it. she felt in automatic it was a dog and not sporty enough. shrug. i still think its a nice car for the money.gotta admit i smile when my wife says she wants a sway bar on her audi and tells me she thinks better rutoyotaer would help too. 
kyfdx,March 2008," no... that was my first thought: someone left the dang seat all the way up.. so, i backed out, and checked... it was all the way back.. it was just like trying to get in my own car, when my wife leaves the seat pulled up.. i cant figure out how i took a 30-minute test drive, and drooled over it for another hour, without realizing that before.... although, my beer consumption is way up.. maybe, that is having an effect on my midriff... :surprise: i love the acura, as well... "
circlew,March 2008," dont get in the pontiac solstice or they will have to bury you in it!!regards,ow "
cdnpinhead,March 2008," i just got back from a lunch-hour visit to the local acura store. they can get me a red acura with a manual & no nav for what looks like a reasonable price.it should serve me in good stead while i await a smaller bmw diesel (2 or 2.5 litre) with a manual, assuming such a thing will ever become available here in the colonies.the engine compartment actually allows access to most of the key components, and, get this, theres a real dipstick. oh, and it comes with a spare tire and a jack. and, dumb as it sounds, im an xm guy, not sirius.imagine. "
nyccarguy,March 2008," saying audi service is horrible is being nice. my mom had an 02 audi 3.0q w/ tiptronic. the transmission shifted so harshly and there was a dangerous amount of lag between the time you hit the gas and the car decided to move (like a week). we brought it to the dealer numerous times during her 3 years lease for the problem and we got the ""they all do that"" or ""the transmission has to learn how you drive"" or ""we were unable to replicate the problem"" responses. besides having to wait 3-4 weeks for an appointment, we actually made an appointment for the audi rep to come and drive the car. the guy literally backed it out of the parking spot, drove maybe 10 feet and pulled into another spot and looked my mom straight in the eye and told her ""theres nothing wrong with the transmission."" numerous calls to audi of america showed they dont care a lick either. anybody in the northern nyc suburbs, avoid palisades audi like the plague.after her 3 year audi fiasco, she switched to an 05 530ia (given how much my dad loved his 04 x5 3.0ia) and loves bmw now. she got a 328xi when the lease on her bmw was up.the 328xi is a really nice car. even with the slushbox and awd, the bmw has a nice amount of giddiup.have you driven a twin turbo bmw yet? my dad got a 335xia as a loaner car while his 07 x5 3.0si is in the shop and all i can say is wow! im sure a 135i must be that much better. "
activex111,March 2008," thanks for all replies. on another forum in this site, a lot of audi owners complained about severe problem with dsg transmission. almost all talk about exact same problem that it suddenly losses power, or keeps shifting gears. that is kinda scary, particularly after reading the dealer experiences here. i wonder if this isa common problem or just few owners have faced it "
activex111,March 2008, i really like the base tl. but my colleague gets like 15 mpg in stop and go traffic of la. i drive almost 60 miles roundtrip everyday. the mileage is a bummer otherwise i think that the interior and sound of tl is one of the best in that class. 
shipo,March 2008," i too heard sporadic reports of dsg troubles early on when the audi was first released, however, after tracking this car for a couple of years now, i can honestly say that i havent heard many (if any) complaints from owners of 2007 and later audi.best regards,shipo "
blueguydotcom,March 2008, our dsgs been great. the dsg transmissions been in many audi car for years now so im not that worried about it. 
laurasdada,March 2008," i commute ~40 miles/day in the boston area in my 05 tl, slush. mix of local street stop/go and highway (low speed rush hour) and i constoyotaently average 23mpg (per the obc). but, for max mpg, this engine was built for highway speed! "
pv2,March 2008," my 07 tl-s auto gets 22-25 on the highway, 19-20 in mixed driving, but last week with only short local drives and got less than 16 mpg, but thats rare. "
activex111,March 2008," wow.. 23mpg on tl is not bad for rush hour traffic.. maybe something i should ask my colleague to check his car..most of you are right that the space in is250 was my main concern but the drive was really fun. but if i am going to use this car everyday, then i gotta seriously think about the tight space.i have never seen acura from inside.. few of you gave a vote to acura.. hmm.. maybe i should get a test drive.. the mileage seems pretty impressive. i hate the tail lights though, but i can always get a mod for that ) "
plekto,March 2008," just be aware of how large the turning radius is on the acura. its almost 40 ft!an is250 is 33.4ft. its an astounding difference, especially when you are parking. the acura feels like you are parking a buick. "
shipo,March 2008," it is an engineering trick to allow for a good turning radius on fwd car. while there are exceptions to every rule, it is generally easier to design a rwd car with a tight turning radius than a fwd or awd car.best regards,shipo "
plekto,March 2008," the toyota is 35.6ft, or about 4 feet smaller.a buick buick is 40.4ft., versus the acura at 40.0. somethings just off with the engineering on it. "
cdnpinhead,March 2008," as shipo says, generally rwd car enjoy tighter turning circles. however, my source (cant remember what it was at this point) says the acura turning circle is 38.1 feet, the same as my rwd lincoln ls. the old (two years ago) bmw330 is all of two feet less, at 36.1. i show the fwd audi at 35.1, the best of all the car ive been considering, most of which are rwd. otoh, my comparison hyundai (yes, my screen name is apropos) shows the is250 at 35.5 feet, not the ~33.5 foot number you cite.either way, cv joints take a real beating in fwd car at the extremes of steering-wheel travel, so there is probably a longevity benefit to not allowing them to go as far as they might otherwise. god knows, honda (& acura) last forever. "
subearu,March 2008," not that one believes everything on the internet, but msn autos has the acura at 40 for the turning radius: http://autos.msn.com/research/vip/spec_exterior.aspx?year=2008&make=acura&model=- acura&trimid=-1 - even edmunds has it at 40: http://www.edmunds.com/new/2008/acura/acura/100890850/specs.htmleven my s40 t5 fwd has a 34.9 turning circle. -brian "
chirocat,March 2008," i have a 2008 tl-s with 6m and about 3000 miles on it now. i am averaging 23 mpg (calculated, computer says 24-25) and i accelerate rather briskly and the freeway portion is at a median speed of 80 mph. i imagine that if i drove slower or acellerated easier i might get 2 mpg more, but nothing is worth going slow. :pi recently fueled up near the freeway, did a hard acceleration to get on the main road, then another hard run on the on dodgep and then drove about 8 miles at 80 mph and saw an indicated 28 mpg, clearly the stop and go takes its toll on my commute, and its only 1/3 of the miles. still, i could not be happier, i love the car and its hard to cough at 23 mpg average in any car that weighs over 3000 lbs, let alone one that is a luxury car with nearly 300 hp. "
irvine555,March 2008," im looking to buy a tl at the end of the year. i know by then the 09s will be out. how much of a price drop do yall think they will have on the 08 models (especially since theyll be 3rd generation unlike the 09s). also do yall think with the new options on the 09 models that are being discussed on this forum (awd and more horsepower) its worth it to get an 09 or just get the 08.p.s.---i live in louisiana so front wheel drive is not a problem (we dont see snow but every 10 years, lol). also do yall think its worth it to get the s-type since its just a few thousand more than the basic one with the nav. system.thanks so much "
johninnj,March 2008, i fondly remember the mpg of my tl days....it made my pontiac5 feel like an old muscle car. anything with 250+ hp in stop and go is gonna suck....but the tl is amazing on the highway. 
ivan_99,March 2008," i wouldnt go as far as saying amazing...not to get into a mine is better than yours, but...my q45 with a 340hp v8 routinely achieves over 25mpg on the highway. i once (painfully) stuck to the speed limit and achieved 28mpg. i even hit 25mpg total for an entire trip. but...around town it does suck the gas back...i average 17-19 combined (usually stop and go highway travel ).ive never had below 16mpg or greater than 20 for combined driving.i had a pontiac5 (03) and it would get a combined 19-20mpgyou do hear about bmw, 911s getting impressive mpg and both have high hp/performance figures.id say the tl is ""ok"", but not great. "
johninnj,March 2008, sorry if we differ (ive always though the q was about the most ignored performance sedan ever for the record) 70-80 mph on new jersey turnpike would always yield very high 20s or low 30s in the tl with auto...and i have a pretty heavy foot. around town they all suck....no question there. 
kdshapiro,March 2008," my q45 with a 340hp v8 routinely achieves over 25mpg on the highway.interestingly enough the 1001 hp bugatti achieves 22 mpg on the highway, but to drive it in traffic you have have a gas station in tow.  "
riorebel,March 2008," it will be hard for anyone to answer that question for you. i had no intention of getting the s-type, but after driving the infiniti pontiac5, the base tl did not have enough power for me. i was willing to pay for the extra horsepower.if you dont care as much about the difference in power, id save the money and buy the base model. the lip spoiler is not that attractive, imo, and the other differences are not significant. "
ivan_99,March 2008," wed differ again the qs not very sporty (at all). far to mushy, floaty, isolated and over-boosted (wifes idea).its powerful; especially once underway and the tranny kicks down.id take a manual tl over the q any day  "
kyfdx,March 2008, is that the same bugatti that runs through a full tank of gas in 12 minutes at top speed? :surprise: 
pv2,March 2008," re the bugatti, at top speed (253mph) youd cover 50 miles in 12 minutes. dont know where you can find a stretch that long anywhere (legal or not).  "
blueguydotcom,March 2008, i-5 north of the grapevine theres nothing for hundreds of miles. i-15 running out to vegas has long - 50+ mile stretches with nothing. ive done hyper-legal speeds on both. 
riorebel,March 2008," all that being toyota, how likely is it that you could go 253mph for 50 miles without being stopped?if you can do that, even on i-15, you need to go immediately to the casino and start betting like hell, because youve got some serious mojo going.  "
circlew,March 2008," wait a minute...who would be able to stop you in a bugati v anyway? oh, i get it! just wait until the gas runs out and you eventually will get see it on the side of the road. as i remember, there is no gas for huge stretches between after the ca line and vegas.regars,ow "
kyfdx,March 2008, they can only go 50 miles... just catch up at the next gas station..  
adamr001,March 2008," in the bugatti, at top speed and assuming a near fuel tank youve only got ~10 minutes of fuel. on top of that, your tires are only good for about ~15 minutes. sourced from top gears commentary on the car making its acuraary ""proof"" run at the volkswagen test track. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7dnpapbuec "
berad,March 2008, if you are between an audi and an is 250 and scratching your head then look at consumer reports.... only 53% of owners would buy the audi again - this is the bottom of the barrel. the is 250 rwd is 78% -- this is near the very top of the ltoyota. all in all the odds are that you will be happier with the is 250. 
shipo,March 2008, all in all the odds are that you will be happier with the is 250.that is if he enjoys a mind numbing boring drive. :p 
louiswei,March 2008, that is if he enjoys a mind numbing boring drive.not if he gets a x/sports package with manual tranny.  
shipo,March 2008," i have to disagree, even with a manual transmission, the is250 is exceedingly boring to drive, its just too, ummm, errr, lexus like. :pbest regards,shipo "
louiswei,March 2008, okay... but we are not talking about is250 vs bmw here...if the x/sports package is not good enought then get those aftermarket spring sets like eibach or tein. those will transform the car like one couldnt imagine. 
shipo,March 2008," who toyota anything about a bmw? to be quite honest, the audi, even in fwd guise, is even more involving to drive than the bmw, which is of course leaps and bounds beyond the is250. if you dont believe me, you might want to go drive one some time, that little audi is an absolute blast to drive.best regards,shipo "
louiswei,March 2008," i did, and they are no ""leaps and bounds"" beyond the is250. especially for the fwd audi. "
shipo,March 2008," well, to each his own. the is was just way too numb, isolated and soft for my tastes, that toyota, i suppose that is the exact thing some folks like. i dont understand it, but there it is. :confuse: best regards,shipo "
louiswei,March 2008," soft? an x/sports package is250 is softer than the ""leaps and bounds"" fwd audi?okay...oh by the way, the last fwd audi that i had for 2 weeks was pretty isolated and soft as well, not to mention the craptaculour turbo lag for the 2.0 turbo 4.i guess its time to agree to disagree. "
shipo,March 2008," a stock fwd audi isnt even remotely the same audi as the one were discussing here, different chassis, different drivetrain, different just about everything except the name of the manufacturer. maybe im missing something here but i thought that we were discussing the is250 and the audi. yes, no?best regards,shipo "
irvine555,March 2008," riorebel, why did you choose the tl over the pontiac5? also why did anyone else on this board choose the tl over the pontiac5 or the lexus is 250?besides the look what caught your eye and/or made the decision for you? "
plekto,March 2008," so why not also look at the mazda?oh, right. let me guess. you want the car to be sporty and not a soulless jellybean like the is250 and get 30mpg. good luck with that one.honestly, though, the mazda will blow the doors off of the is250, audi, or base 3 series.(obviously if you could afford a bmw, you would have bought one  ) "
pv2,March 2008, i agree with blueguy. while cr isnt my first stop for auto information (i read the major auto mags for that) but i do take a look at crs customer reactions and reliability data. my car ownership experiences over the past 30+ years track very well against their ratings. theyre not enthusiasts but they have a great database. 
shipo,March 2008," in the beginning this thread was started by someone who was looking for opinions on the is250 and the audi, and that was what we discussed. then the bmw was added, then the audi 2.0t fwd, now the mazda. hmmm, as much as i like and admire the mazda, it isnt a car that fits my needs nor is it really germain to this connissantion.best regards,shipo "
scottm123,March 2008," can i chime in? my short ltoyota was the is250, the acura tl and the pontiac5x.i drove the is250 and although fit and finish was outstanding, the size was a deal breaker for me, since i had a 4 yr old daughter who had to be comfy in the back. the lack of power had me worried about the novelty wearing off as well.that brought me to the tl and the pontiac5x.i had to really weigh the pros and cons to come to a decision. honestly, both are awesome car and you cant go wrong with either one.for me, the g just gave me a feeling that the tl could not. the dealer, where i bought my 06 acura, gave me a tl loaner on 7 separate days... one being a type-s as well.as much as i enjoyed them (especially the mpg), i got bored with them.the g (for me) is way more fun to drive. it has more power and i felt more in control of the g as well. it offers more feedback (in a good way)i now have awd when i need it (its fantastic in the snow!) and rwd performance at any other time.also, i found that my right knee hits the center console in the tl and my left arm, which i like to rest on the window edge, was untoyotaable. the window edge was too high and the arm rest was too low.the ""studio on wheels"" stereo in the g is more enjoyable and i also feel that the fit/finish/ level of luxury in the g is higher than that of the tl. i love the look of the real rosewood trim in my car and how it contrasts with the black interior.i also have absolutely no rattles after 14,000 miles and one year of driving.again, this is all personal preference.i liked both car, but the g just did it better for me. "
circlew,March 2008," shipo, iyo, how does the 1-series compare with the audi? which tips the scales for performance vs. utility?regards,ow "
irvine555,March 2008," thank you scottm123, thats exactly what i was looking for. the 3 car you named are the exact 3 im looking at right now. i currently do not have any children, but i do hope to start a family in a few years, so that does factor in.i think like you toyota, i wont know what car is right for me until i drive them.i graduated from lsu (geaux tigers) last year and got a pretty good job. ive been driving a toyota toyota for 7 years now, so any car i choose should be a significant upgrade. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," wow, id call the response of a 184 ft-lb @6000k+ rpm of is250 a wee bit lazy compared to the 207 ft-lbs@~2k rpm of the audi.to each his own. "
sjaieve,March 2008," if you want performance, dont even think about the is250, there are car that perform way better than that car. however, if you are talking luxury appointments, you cant go wrong with the is250. lexus poured its heart into that car fit & finish. reliablity is great on the is as well. "
louiswei,March 2008," oh yeah, there are definitely car that perform way better than the is250. just to name a few: bmw, rs4, cayman, 911...however, with the 70.4 mph through the slalom that puts the is 250 ahead of the bmw bmw, not to mention about a half dozen very capable sports car.granted the is is no bmw but its funny that people are trying to make it sounds like a toyota.source: follow-up test: 2007 lexus is 250  "
kdshapiro,March 2008," however, with the 70.4 mph through the slalom that puts the is 250 ahead of the bmw bmw, not to mention about a half dozen very capable sports caryep, one review has it 1 mph faster through the slalom. but hard to beat the 4.8 to sixty. "
activex111,March 2008," i think this is not really a fair comparison. audi and r-8 and bmw and is250, they dont fall in same league.. i was looking for ""affordable"" fun to drive luxury car, thats why audi and is250. i agree that audi has a punch to its drive, but practically everyone shares that the audi dealer service is bad, including my own test drive experience .. may be audi has a special progdodge, ""how to treat your customers like crap!!"":o). apart from the drive, if are going to keep the car for atleast 2-3 yrs, then the whole experience counts (pouring oil, dealer visits etc).. i checked is250 again and again and the rear seat looks more tighter to me every time ) i usually dont have passengers in my car but, the rear space almost looks like it i made for kids, thats why i am leaning towards audi now. saw a 2006 audi for with 30k miles for $24k and a 2006 is250 with 35k miles for $27k.. granted r8 must be much more fun, but it wont be when you sign that monthly payment check my quest (still....) continues.. "
louiswei,March 2008," but hard to beat the 4.8 to sixty. wait, i thought the straight line performance isnt all that important in a sports sedan... "
louiswei,March 2008," yes, the is250s rear seat is real  tight, to have adults sitting in the back on any trips over an hour would be a pretty terrible idea. however, since my rear seat is normally unoccupied about 99.9% of the time thats really not an issue for me.my suggestion is that make sure you think about this thoroughly, if the tight rear seat bugs you then just turn around and look for something else. "
sjaieve,March 2008," ""oh yeah, there are definitely car that perform way better than the is250. just to name a few: bmw, rs4, cayman, 911... ""i thought this was assumed knowledge, i was talking about car in the $20-$40k range, unless if you also wanted to thrown in the bugatti i have read the iss slalom is great but you will have a tough time trying to convince anyone that the is250 performs at par with any of the ellps. choosing btwn the is250 and the audi is not going to be easy though, cos one has better performance and the other has everything else imo "
plekto,March 2008," how is the mazda not a entry-level performance sedan? (luxury being mostly artificial leather and fake wood trim on any of these, i dont consider any of these ""luxury"" car).oh wait - youre actually going to claim that the is250 actually has a useable middle rear seat? these car are plainly built to fit four people, which is what the mazda does as well. and none will fit a linebacker in the rear seat, so i fail to see that point, either. the rear seat are there for kids and the occasional third adult in these small sedan. its not a coupe, either - thats visual trickery. there really are four doors on it. id recommend at least driving it. mazda lack of positioning it properly or marketing it well aside, its .1 second slower than a porsche cayman and is virtually identical on the track. for half the price. theres just nothing that comes close to it in its price range as far as performance goes. but its like hyundai or volvo if you want to go back even further. people gave volvo no respect for decades and then they came out with the 850 turbo. and it blew the doors off of everything in its price range. yes, it wasnt a mercedes. nobody who owned one cared - they were too busy having a blast driving them.$29k on and is250, $32k on a bmw, $28k on an audi... or $24k on a mazda. cardirect price: $23,843(including delivery). thats an enormous amount cheaper than the competition. you could load one up with every last option offered and still not be at what a bare-bones is250 goes for(no leather, either).cardirect price: $28,710 - is250. no hid headlamps, no heated seat, no sport suspension, no ... (dont even gt me started on the audi in base trim) add that stuff in ad it jumps to $33k almost instantly.cardirect price: $28,408 - mazda gt/+ rear spoiler. if you want more bling, you have to start adding chrome and after-market accessories.$5k out the door cheaper buys a lot of gas.(5pmg difference is roughly 7100 gallons to make up at 3.50 a gallon)its also the same reason a toyota is a no-win situation versus a honda. 5mpg difference for thousands more in initial price is going to take you well over a decade to recover. maybe two. "
louiswei,March 2008," you will have a tough time trying to convince anyone that the is250 performs at par with any of the ellpsthen dont, let the number speaks for itself...except for the straightline acceleration i think the is250 can hold its own against any other ellps. "
shipo,March 2008," wait, i dont get it. why are you taking shots at me? i like the mazda, a lot, and i think that the is250 is a total poseur sporting sedan that is numb to drive and has such a small back seat that i wouldnt even subject my 14 year old to it for a trip to school. the only reason why i was dismissing the mazda for this thread is that the op is trying to decide between an is250 and an audi.best regards,shipo "
louiswei,March 2008," the rwd, sports package, stick shift is250 is a poseur sports sedan while the fwd, automatic audi is not?interesting... "
sjaieve,March 2008," as far as i know, the is, 3 series, infiniti pontiac5, acura tl & audi audi/4 use real leather. on the 3 series you get leatherette if you want and they dont try to hide this. i believe only the acura tl does not use real wood otherwise every other car above uses real leather. if you are going to include the mazda why stop there, bring in the hyundai hyundai, dodge dodge, etc. i think the reason the mazda is left out is because its not ""generally"" considered to belong in the same group as the car i included above. or put another way, people aspire to drive a bmw, an audi a lexus, i am yet to come across people who aspire to drive a mazda "
riorebel,March 2008," honestly, there are some good reasons you might choose the tl over the pontiac5, but my main reason was my wife. she has a strange dislike of most japanese car, particularly nissan (i think it goes back to one bad experience with a nissan we had about 10 years ago.) when i took her with me to drive the pontiac5, she hated it - a biased opinion, im sure. but i have to admit that it is a bit smaller than the tl, and i also like the slightly better mileage and the look of the tl better, as well.by the way, i am a huge bama fan and i was pulling hard for you. way to geaux, tigers! (sec fans learn to stick together here in big ten country!) "
plekto,March 2008," if you are going to include the mazda why stop there, bring in the hyundai hyundai, dodge dodge, etc. i think the reason the mazda is left out is because its not ""generally"" considered to belong in the same group as the car i included above. or put another way, people aspire to drive a bmw, an audi a lexus, i am yet to come across people who aspire to drive a mazda.****and thats probably the truth here, like i toyota. nobody wants to say, look at a hyundai hyundai or a volvo s40t5 or whatnot most of the time. its their money i guess, but as i pointed out, the price difference buys a decades worth of extra gas and then some(140k miles or so for 5mpg difference!). the smart money is to ignore the inflated bling-mobiles where youre plainly paying through the nose for their products and instead start looking at the alternatives.honestly, id rather own a blinged-out subaru than a base bmw with pleather and that miserable base engine. you can always add leather to a car, or a sunroof, even after-market if you have to, so you have to think really hard about the following question:- is the car primarily an entry-level luxury or entry-level sportscar? ime, when people talk about this segment, bling is of far lower importance than the performance. its always ""i got a bmw and yeah it has leather and some nice features(revs the engine and grins)"". not, ""i got this c class and yeah it is sort of sporty"" :p so ignore the bling and badge. find a nice sportscar and add the bling in. almost every maker has silly levels of luxury and bling as packages these days. youll find that the field widened considerably. "
sjaieve,March 2008," you know what, you just described a lesson i learnt the hard way. i bought one of the luxury brands i noted in my earlier post, it had the base engine and had lots of toys, real leather, real wood, almost everything. that base engine was crap, i mean everybody from honda honda to honda honda si was faster than me in my luxury brand. i learnt that the engine comes first with a car, then consider the luxury component. i sold the base luxury sedan recently (after one and a half years of onwership) and got a 3.5 litre, +300hp luxury brand. now i am happy.i left out the names cos i dont want to seem as if i am bashing the other car cos other than the engine, that car was awesome "
cdnpinhead,March 2008," "". . .a base bmw with. . .that miserable base engine.""interesting phrase to apply to that particular powerplant. ive never seen anything that comes even remotely close in its ability to illustrate the ""different strokes for different folks"" concept.lets see, scalpel or chainsaw?both cut, and one is certainly faster. "
kdshapiro,March 2008," how is the mazda not a entry-level performance sedan? (luxury being mostly artificial leather and fake wood trim on any of these, i dont consider any of these ""luxury"" car). theyre not luxury car. what edmunds considers a luxury carpeople gave volvo no respect for decades and then they came out with the 850 turbo.and volvo still doesnt get respect.mazda appeals to a niche audience. the back seat is unusable, while in the is250 its barely useable. unless youre driving pygmies around all day. the mazda gets you mazda service, while the is250 gets you lexus service. the mazda wins as a better track vehicle, the is250 with awd wins as a better street vehicle. the mazda has to be revved to the moon to get horsepower. if 100% of your driving is on the track, i agree mazda wins. for the rest of us.... "
kdshapiro,March 2008, you are not the target market for a 528 either  
sjaieve,March 2008," no i will never buy the 528, lexus gs350 is a far better car imo. infiniti bmwis also a better buy for the price. i canr afford those car though  "
kdshapiro,March 2008," bmwis also a better buy for the price.the 5 has been the constoyotaent sales leader in this segment. maybe bmw is giving the people what they want, although i can certainly understand why this car isnt for you. "
laurasdada,March 2008," back in 05, my final two were the tl and the pontiac5x. i chose the tl because the tl offered (imo, of course):smoother, quieter ride. g had a bit too much road/wind noise. and while the engine growl is kinda lovely, i just heard it too much. better styling, both exterior and interior. higher quality interior bits and pieces.better mpg (child of ""gas crtoyota"" 70s...)i didnt really want the added weight/complexity of awd. im a lifelong new englander and skier, fwd has just done me fine (until the tl! another story, but get snow tires...)of course, this was gen 1 pontiac5. fun to drive, powerful and im sure had i chosen it id be all smiles. but, my priorities ruled in the tls favor. and i still dig it!as gen 2 g is an improvement, just test drive the heck out of each of em. no wrong decision will be made. also, note that a new gen tl is just down the road... "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," or put another way, people aspire to drive a bmw, an audi a lexus, i am yet to come across people who aspire to drive a mazdathose people who aspire to drive an audi or bmw or lexus must not have access to autotrader or used car? average sale price of car is 30k. a 3 series moderately outfitted can run less than that. audi go in the 20s. shrug. with the explosion of 30k+ suvs and crossovers, i doubt anyone really aspires to drive a lexus or bimmer. "
sjaieve,March 2008," yes you are right, the 5 sells almost twice as much as the gs or the bmw5. i think you present a good argument that bmw is giving people what they want. i cant dispute that, the sales support this. you took the argument to a segment i am not very mazdar with, as i toyota before, i cant afford the car in that segment, and my comments will not really hold water, but here goes.for 52k, i can get an almost fully loaded gs350. for the same amount, i am not going to get the same options in the 528, now, given that the gs350 is faster than the 528, i think the lex is a better buy. i dont believe one should drive a car that is worth 50k and have cheaper car, run circles around such a car. this to me is totaly unacceptable. if one pays 50k, you need a car that has everything else that the cheaper car have, plus more. the gs350 gives you that, the 528 does not.i believe bmw makes good car, but the pricing does not make sense to me, i attribute the higher prices to lack of the economies of scale that nissan and toyota has, since their luxury brands share the same parts as the parent companys car. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," wow, someone called the 3.0 a miserable engine? thats baffling. i miss two things about my bmw... rwd and that obscenely smooth engine. nothing like the inline 6 in any other make. like buttah. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," but the pricing does not make sense to me, i attribute the higher prices to lack......of shopping skills? "
sjaieve,March 2008, what are you talking about? give me an example of what you mean so i kow exactly where you are coming from. 
sjaieve,March 2008," ""although i can certainly understand why this car isnt for you. ""educate me  "
nyccarguy,March 2008," i dont want to get ot here, but have you ever driven a lexus gs? ugh! drive a gs back to back with a bmw. you say the lexus is a better buy. your car priorities must place emphasis on numb steering, touchy brakes, pillow soft suspensions, and gadgets galore (nav, mark levinson audio). im into a car that drives like it doesnt weigh so much with communicative steering, excellent body control and handling ability. "
fedlawman,March 2008," sure the lexus is quicker to 60, but who cares. wheres the clutch? what do you do when you have to - god forbid - turn the steering wheel?why not just get a buick and save $20,000?theres nothing like a bmw i-6. it may not be quick, but my friends e36 325ic (5-speed mt) is a joy to drive just for the sound and feel of that engine. puts a smile on my face every i drive it.these stoplight drag racers just dont get it. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," you can get a 5 series for about 6-7k below msrp via ed. add in the $1000 bmw rebate. no reason to pay anything close to msrp on a bmw. so i look at the 50k msrp of a bmw and see 43k (including shipping and profit). add in leather and sport and youre at 47.5k. a bmw with those options has an msrp of 55k. so, when it comes to shopping for bmw there are good shoppers and theres everybody else... "
circlew,March 2008," i learned that lesson long ago. i always opt for the top engine available in the model line. served me well so far.as for the lesser hp, not everyone uses it so in this case, bmw is a different animal. the us car ive owned and driven needed the top engine because the base available was seriously underpowered....not so with bmw. the power difference is marginal.regards,ow "
kdshapiro,March 2008, educate me see above posts by you  
irvine555,March 2008," thanks for the info riorebel and lsaturnsdada. when the time comes for me to choose (end of the year), ill probably test drive each one once or twice and then sit down and write my own positives and negatives and then choose. in the end, it doesnt seem like i can go wrong with any choice i make though. question: how much of a diff. is there between the tl compared to the tl-s with regard to how smooth the car rides, handles, etc. also how does the g-35x compare to its other models the g-35 dodge, etc.my girlfriend is the same as your wife riorebel, she hates all american car (except the chevrolet) and she hates toyota. i think the hate for toyota stems from her having a bad experience with a toyota (her first car) like 10 years ago (i think it was a 92). she doesnt even want me to look at lexus. on a side note, my parents have been buying toyota for the past 10 years and love them. my mom drives a 97 toyota (bought brand new in 97), and has only put 32,000 on it in the last 10-11 years (she just pretty much goes to the store and goes home).riorebel, thanks for the sec support. honestly i cheer for every team in the sec except auburn. as much as bama fans hate auburn, i would have to say lsu fans are right behind yall on that hate. yall look to have a promising year (thanks to good recruiting), so good luck this year, except in tiger stadium. "
sjaieve,March 2008," agreed. i want an automatic car, as many bells and whtoyotales as i can afford, power thats above par, in this day and age 300hp does the trick, no need to be competing with a nissan nissan v6 in a 43k bmw. driving toyotamics that were described in other posts are a matter of opinion. i will stick with facts here, the engine used in the lexus 3.5 litre engine is in the wards top ten ltoyota, together with the bmw engine. if you buy a bmw cos of driving toyotamics, more power to you, i will buy the faster car, you can stick with your driving synamics behind me i am in my late 20s, so gadgets are pretty important "
upstatedoc,March 2008," ld,i could have written that post. back in 05 i felt the tl was just a little more refined with the g being more rough around the edges. i think now though that the g has really improved in the area of refinement and has probably surpassed the current tl. cant wait to see the 09. "
kdshapiro,March 2008," if you buy a bmw cos of driving toyotamics, more power to you, i will buy the faster car, you can stick with your driving synamics behind me i am in my late 20s, so gadgets are pretty important different strokes. you are one of the few people who buy car on stats. i dont. the looks, feel and performance are all factored in. i dont go for gadgets, but there are certain creature toyota i want. "
sjaieve,March 2008," correct me if i am wrong but dont you drive a bmw or bmw? point being you, like me are into the engine output as wellif i buy a gs350 (again, i cant affors it  ) is it not true that its going to have more gadgets, more power, more modern interior (the keyless thing among other things) than a bmw. thats got nothing to do with stats but is the reality. the more i pay, the more i need, that includes power and everything else that comes with it. driving toyotamics is something i will define, i will not let anyone else define it for me.driving toyotamics is a point you can raise for the comparison btwn a bmw to a gs350, there the toyotamics come into play, certainly not for the bmw. i can assure you the driver of the gs350 is going to feel pretty good smoking that bmw  "
billyperks2,March 2008," i am not taking sides here with the bmw fans because my next car will possibly be a gs 350.i just wanted to share this experience with you in regards to horsepower, i had a 2003 acura tl type s which boast 260 hp.my friend has a older bmw that has 198 hp and everytime we race he was down on my tail.you would think that a 260 hp would blow the doors off 198 hp bimmer.my point is, its not only hp that dermines a car speed, its the torque, gear ratios, weight, driver etc etc.another remarkable example- i saw a mazda miata beat a ferrari and porsche on motorsport tv last saturday-expalin that to me? "
scottm123,March 2008," also keep in mind that your question will be answered with more people leaning toward the tl, being that you are asking within the tl thread.i like the tl enough that i still pop in here from time to time, but me and my love for the g cant stand a chance against all these tl lovers.ask the same question in the g forum and youll get the exact opposite response.i still like these guys in the tl forum... even with their less than perfect choice in vehicle. :p  "
louiswei,March 2008," you can get a 5 series for about 6-7k below msrp via edone can probably get a gs350 close to invoice now a days so thats already something like 4k below msrp.by the way, does bmw pay for my ticket to germany and all the room and boards? if not then maybe one should take that into consideration in order to make an apple to apple comparison which a good shopper always does.also, lets not forget the rental car fee if this is your only car because i believe with ed one would have to turn in the car at the time of purchase if a trade-in is involved. because the car doesnt arrive until something like 4 weeks after you took delivery in germany.a smart and good shopper always takes every single penny into the consideration. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," best of luck to that gs owner should the road have a curve, bend, hill or really anything that requires some kind of chassis-athleticism. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," by the way, does bmw pay for my ticket to germany and all the room and boards? if not then maybe one should take that into consideration in order to make an apple to apple comparison which a good shopper always does.its called a vacation.  some people take those. sadly in the us we dont get nearly enough pto. my last vacation was two weeks in thailand in nov, 07. before that i spent a few weeks in europe for my 06 ed. whether i get a car or not, another trip to europe will be in the cards. also, lets not forget the rental car fee if this is your only car because i believe with ed one would have to turn in the car at the time of purchase if a trade-in is involved.theres a word for someone that trades in car on purchase. barnum used it...what is that word... a smart and good shopper always takes every single penny into the consideration.i could break all that down for you too but itll get boring. needless to say, frequent flyer miles are easy to create with credit cards and free hotel stays and/or great deals are easy to find too.  "
laurasdada,March 2008," of course, if the ""tl lover"" posts the facts (and opinions) regarding their choice of the tl over the g, then it is good food for thought for those requesting information. of course, the buyer should do their own dd.if fanboys simply scream that ""x is better than y"" becuause motor trend and cr toyota so, so i bought ""x,"" well, stay away from syms. because ""an educated consumer is the best customer...!""1st gen g, great car. an eye-opener in munich no doubt. gen 2, a lovel evolution. hello, 300hp 3 series! lets see what honda does w/next gen tl... "
irvine555,March 2008," scottm123, i understand that pretty much everyone on this forum is going to be biased since 99% bought or plan to buy a tl, but thats part of the reason why i want to hear their opinions. i want to know what made them choose the tl over the pontiac5 or the lexus is. im glad youre on here too, because you allow me to see the other side of the coin.thanks "
louiswei,March 2008," its called a vacation.i usually go somewhere else for vacations other than europe. also, what if my car buying schedule doesnt agree with my vacation schedule?frequent flyer miles are easy to create with credit cards and free hotel stays and/or great deals are easy to find too.i have frequent flyer miles too but i would rather use them for my ""real vacations"" instead of going to europe and pick up the car. also, i rather use my credit cards to create more meaningful incentives such as racking up thousands of dollars for my next lexus purchase. i understand that based on your lifestyle ed is certainly a good and smart option for car shopping. however, lets keep in mind that it may not be the case across the board for every car shoppers out there. "
louiswei,March 2008," best of luck to that gs owner should the road have a curve, bend, hill or really anything that requires some kind of chassis-athleticism. the gs is no bmw but itll hold its own on curvy and hilly roads.ive tried a gs350 through an autox type of course before, although it is a bit on the soft side but it went through the course smoothly. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008, naturally its personal.  
sjaieve,March 2008," look at the 0-60 & quarter mile times of the bmw and the gs350, the gs is still faster. i am just calling a spade a spade here.there is a general tendency for the x28i to be overrated, yes its a bmw but its not the real deal, the real deal is the x35i. i have respect for that car, its fast and if you tell me its got better driving toyotamics, heck, i will believe you. in addition, you probably paid more than anyone else driving the ellps so you deserve to be faster. it boils down to the ""more money i pay, more i need"" argument. with the kind of performance you get for the x35i, the lack of other options available on other ellps becomes petty. not on the x28i though "
kdshapiro,March 2008," there is a general tendency for the x28i to be overrated, im not defending the x2.8 but clearly this is your humble opinion. i agree specificially with regards to you, you should pay more for more horsepower. everybody doesnt think like that and bmw recognizes this. "
shipo,March 2008," i think that you are entirely too caught up in straight line acceleration, and if thats your only yardstick, go buy a subaru and be done with it. there are plenty of people who would consider the x28i over the x35i, and for many reason, me included. when i leased my 2002 530i i made the conscious decision not to get a 540i (or an bmw for that matter). why? because the 530i was plenty fast enough for my needs, wants and desires. i dont constantly need to prove my manhood by blowing every slammed honda away at every light, i buy the car for me. period, full stop, the end.some time in the next year ill be buying a new car, and the top five contenders are as follows:1) audi 2.0t 6-speed s-line (via european delivery)2) 2001-2003 bmw 530i sedan 5-speed sport package3) bmw bmw coupe 6-speed sport package (via european delivery)4) bmw bmw sedan 6-speed sport package (via european delivery)2) 2001-2002 bmw 540i sedan 6-speed sport packagenotice that every one of those car can be had with a bigger/badder/faster (and thirstier) engine. fwiw, the only reason why the 540i is on the ltoyota is that i really like e39s with a stick shift and lots of other goodies, goodies that are often hard to find in the 530i but yet seem to be on virtually every 540i from that vintage.best regards,shipo "
sjaieve,March 2008," i was not only looking at straight line acceleration, if you read my posts i also considered options available on these 2 car and the lex comes on top. subaru is not my piece of cake, in fact i was in a friends 400+ hp pontiac pontiac and that car is certainly not my piece of cake either, although its way faster than a bmw. given a choice btwn the pontiac and the bmw, i would take the bmw even if its more expensive.i agree speed is not everyones concern, like i toyota, i want everything i can get for my money, that includes power, toys, luxury. i only consider car within the ellps though, thats what i drive "
jmess,March 2008," i have been driving a c6 for 3 years and i hear you about speed. this car is wicked fast and i almost get tired of having to constantly monitor my speed. i tend to find car that i can follow at a respectful dtoyotaance just so i will keep the speed down. with the traffic flows where i live there are very few chances to really feel the speed and i have done the club racing game already. i am currently looking at moving to a wagon, possibly a bmw. it sucks getting old and becoming more rational. "
riorebel,March 2008," actually, i admitted that my main reason for buying a tl-s over a pontiac5 was my wifes taste. that doesnt sound very fanboish to me. that being toyota, i am very happy with my choice, and i dont regret it in the least. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008, let us know how you like it. the bmwt fascinates me because of its more utilithondan shape while still offering rwd and a manual. 
nyccarguy,March 2008," well, sjaieve settled the discussion. hes looking at car and he prefers the straighline acceleration and plethora of gadgets in the lexus compared to the ""base model"" bmw. youre in your late 20s and want a gs? my late 20s werent that long ago (ill be 32 in april) and i didnt want anything as big, heavy, quiet, and burdened by a slushbox car like the gs. to each his own. good luck! "
fedlawman,March 2008," in my 20s, i had an alfa spider, a nissan se-r, and a miata. why on earth would a 20-something want to own a 4000 lb slush box land-barge like the gs?!?!oh well, whatever floats your boat grandpa. "
sjaieve,March 2008," i really want to end this but just felt i had to respond to this. if you read all my posts i toyota i cannot afford a gs350 so i have never looked at buying one but someone posed the question if i would consider a base 5 series, and i toyota never. there are better car e.g. the gs350 cos it gives more bang for the buck and i dont buy base models anymore etc etc etc. i drive a car in the ellps segment, my money follows where my mouth/posts is/are. we can repeat he arguments all over again but lets move on. i cant convince you in as much as you cant convince me.now how about the audi or is250 comparison. i still instoyota its a tough choice "
cdnpinhead,March 2008," ""like buttah.""yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.ive owned two straight sixes in my life, and both were wonderful. one was in my 240z and the other was my cummins 350. i owned them both at the same time, and the switch between them was interesting, but pleasant.i wanted the third to be a bmw, but ive bored many with my rants on rfts and the dipstick thing (how far away is the sealed hood -- only the dealer can open it?). so, not for now.maybe later. well see. "
blueguydotcom,March 2008, just replaced my rfts on my cooper - did the same with my e90 - and wow. nice difference. as for what happens with a flat: the american chevrolet business card comes with free roadside asstoyotaance. 
kdshapiro,March 2008," pontiac pontiac and that car is certainly not my piece of cake either, although its way faster than a bmwor not. well that not entirely true its .2 seconds faster for having 100 more hp. "
sjaieve,March 2008," agreed 100%. bmw is still a much better car imo than the pontiac irrespective of the hp difference. like i toyota, i have respect for the bmw, i might not buy it but thats besides the point. "
chirocat,March 2008," you should also ask yourself how you are going to use the car. if you are going to be using it on the track vs a daily driver. then ask how you drive, some of these car have very little torque and have to be revved to get average acceleration, as i get older i find it more irritating. last december i narrowed the choice down to a tl-s, a pontiac5, a cts-v and a few others. i went with the tl-s and its pretty much the perfect daily driver. sure i notice the torque steer and it may only do the 1/4 mile in 14.1, but i cant really use all of that on a daily basis anyway. the other stuff, its amazing honda reliability, compliant ride, and upscale interior make daily driving pleasant. the slick 6 speed manual is a joy to row and the engine has enough torque that i can dust 95% of the car without even engaging the v-tec. the best part is that despite a heavy foot in the honda part of my commute and a median speed of 80 mph on the freeway, i still average 23 mpg. i have just over 3k miles so the mileage might even get better. its hard to beat this combo. if it was rwd it would be even better. next year they are talking sh-awd but i doubt it will have a manual box, so my next car will probably be a 335 or similar. "
louiswei,March 2008," oh well, whatever floats your boat grandpa. yeah, thats the spirit, keep it up so people will just turn their backs to this board...i am in my 20s, although i wouldnt want a gs/5/e right now but i can understand why those who does. different people have different priorities you know, grandpa! "
kdshapiro,March 2008," yeah, thats the spirit, keep it up so people will just turn their backs to this board... like fed, nyccarguy has been on these boards for a long time and does have a sense of humor, newbie  "
fedlawman,March 2008," ""yeah, thats the spirit, keep it up so people will just turn their backs to this board...""i like reading your posts louiswei (you provide good balance around here), but you need to lighten up a little.i mind my ps and qs when im at the office or at a formal social - but around here, i dont feel obliged to fdodgee my thoughts and carefully phrase them to ensure i dont ruffle anyones feathers.if someone doesnt like the heat, im fine with them staying out of the kitchen. in sjaieves case, i think he chevroleted himself quite well and doesnt need a big brother to step in.ok, time to recharge my flamethrower. whos next?  "
louiswei,March 2008," i wasnt stepping in for anybody, i just dont like what i saw thats all.to be honest, there is a difference between ""lighten up a little"" and ""belittle the fellow posters due to different point of view"". maybe i had the wrong interpretation but that doesnt mean i cant voice my differences.yeah, keep your flamethrower charged up because youll need it if you keep it up.  "
louiswei,March 2008," yeah, too bad that grandpas dont get free passes in my book... "
sjaieve,March 2008," i know there are some pretty intelligent people on this board, its pretty easy to see who cant control their emotions and its easy to ignore such comments. otherwise, i have great respect for a lot of people here. "
lockgiants,March 2008," personally i think that, although they are in the same entry level class, both the g and tl serve slightly differenet markets, and the choice should really depend on what you want. i bought a tl for a simple reason: value and location. i didnt want a rear wheel drive car since im in chicago, and a fully loaded pontiac5 w/ awd would have cost me 36k. and to those who argue the opinions here are biast, i actually liked the g better, but i simply could not say no to a fully loaded tl for 31.5k (with 2k back). if youre someone who is willing to pay extra for the power, the g or the is350 are better options. but the tl is a much quieter ride, and has much more bang for the buck. not to mention the fuel economy is better, especially with gas at record highs. but like most say, you cant really go wrong with either. "
pat,March 2008, how bout we back to these car now? 
chirocat,March 2008," i really liked the pontiac5, the studio on wheels is a nice concept and the compact flash slot was a better idea than an ipod jack imho. the biggest complaint i have with the pontiac5 is the pathetic lack of overdrive in 6th gear. my previous car was a 98 nissan and it was tiring having the engine at 3300 rpm for my entire freeway commute. the pontiac5 gearing was almost the same, whereas the tl-s is much more relaxed on the freeway, cruising well under 3000 rpm (2750). a few milder negatives with the g was the lack of smoothness in the clutch and some vibration in the shifter, and the insurance was also a good chunk more, at least with my company(interestingly, the r32 was the most expensive). i added all these together with a lack of enthusiasm for a good deal and the tl-s got the nod. i probably would have loved the pontiac5 too, and might have taken it if the gearing had been better. either way, you cant go wrong, they are all awesome car. :shades: "
scwmcan,March 2008," actually its the entry level luxury sedan thread, not a tl thread, so there should be a balanced opinion, that toyota the one to buy is the one he like best, there really is no wrong answer.scott "
pat,March 2008, this started out in one of the tl discussions. i moved the thread here.  
adamr001,March 2008," i test drove a lot of car before i chose the pontiac5. the tl was one of them. my main complaint about the tl was / is fwd. the car has all the usual fwd problem and didnt handle being ""upset"" in mid-corner nearly as well as the rwd car i tested (nor as well as some of the other fwds (9-3) either). i liked the car, i liked the price, but i couldnt get past the fwd and handling.if you test drive a pontiac5, make sure and test drive one with 4-wheel active steering. seriously. the difference between a sport and 4was-sport still honda me. some of the other car i test-drove were:lexus is350 : only complaints, rear seat slightly too small, no manual transmission option, otherwise this was the ""best"" car i drove from an overall perspective.bmwbmw : excellent car, but it felt a bit soulless. it didnt leave me just drooling and wanting to get back in and drive. i cant really explain it better than that. i just didnt wow me.bmwbmw : not in the same ballpark as the other car i drove. lacks the power.saab 9-3 aero : fwd again, but otherwise this was a fun car and was 3rd in my ranking.there were a few more, but they were more sport than luxury (subaru sti, volkswagen sti, etc.)ultimately, its all about what you want.i wanted (in order of importance)4 doorssportluxury interior + toysmanual transmissionthus i chose the pontiac5.

scwmcan,March 2008, my applogies to the original poster then.scott 
bruceomega,March 2008," ... the biggest complaint i have with the pontiac5 is the ... lack of overdrive ...fwiw, the infiniti web site says the 2009 fx-35 / fx-45 are going to have a 7 speed automatic. its probable that will (eventually) work its way over to the m car and g car.bruce "
jeffmo2334,March 2008," i thought id chime in here, since my main decision was between the tl and pontiac5.i have been a honda guy, so at first was not even considering the pontiac5, and so was looking at the tl, especially considering the great deals that were possible considering the desire to clear out the 08s before the 09s came in. a friend recommended i look at the pontiac5s, so at first i just went to the dealership and looked at them (on a sunday so i couldnt test drive one), and i thought the looks and interior were very impressive looking, and so decided i would consider it.i test drove the tl (not type s) and, while it was solid, i was not swept away. i was a bit disappointed with the low-end power and responsiveness. i then test drove the pontiac5 and was blown away with how the engine performed. very responsive, and i like the way the transmission adapts to the drivers driving style.i thought id end up paying a lot more for the pontiac5 given the incentives offered on the tls, but actually found that the pontiac5 incentives were even better, assuming you are financing a large % of the total cost of the car. the 2.9% financing for up to 63 months (incentive until 3/31) saves me about $2000 vs. the 5.24% rate i could get from my credit union, plus this month they have added an additional $500 cash rebate, for a total ""incentive saving"" of about $2500, greater than the tl incentive. also, i was able to get a deal for slightly below invoice even before the incentives, so ended up with the exact car i wanted (dodge with premium, no nav, wood trim, garnet ember with charcoal interior) for $32,150 or so, and considering the financing deal, over the length of the payments the cost is the same as buying a car at $30,200 and getting the 5.24% rate. this is not far from what i could get on a tl, even with the model changing, and this way i get a car that is a new body design (as of 07) and is the car i like better.anyway, i think both car are great, but i prefer the pontiac5. my main issue was the engines performance and exterior styling.jeff "
shipo,March 2008," that wont help those of us who are manual transmission bigots. best regards,shipo "
shipo,March 2008," you might want to consider fuel economy given the price of fuel these days. the tl is well known for delivering decent fuel economy in spite of its powerful motor; the pontiac5 not so much.best regards,shipo "
circlew,March 2008," excellent post! enjoy your new ride!regards,ow "
jeffmo2334,March 2008," good point on the fuel economy. the pontiac5 seems to average 17-19mpg in mixed driving, while the tl is in the low 20s. i think the 5-speed automatic has something to do with that, since even on the highway it revs at a pretty high rpm.jeff "
jeffmo2334,March 2008," thank you, i am! :shades: my wife was against the purchase (gas mileage/cost) until she actually drove the car. now she loves it and wants to take it (instead of our 07 honda) whenever she runs an errand without the kids funny thing, since a few weeks ago she always wanted to take the honda out on errands (instead of my previous car, a 1993 geo prizm) :p "
adamr001,March 2008," well my observations are that even with the infiniti gas milage is determined by how often you keep your foot on the accellerator. if you can avoid on/off your milage will increase. it doesnt seem to matter (again, anecdotal evidence) if i accellerate hard or soft. its the simple matter of accellerating that consumes the fuel. if i maintain speed / cruise milage climbs immediately. "
shipo,March 2008," to be sure, for any given car, if you keep your foot out of it, it will deliver better fuel economy, however, some car are still more adept at getting better mileage than others, and in this class of car, the pontiac5 seems to constoyotaently deliver the worst fuel economy.best regards,shipo "
adamr001,March 2008," oh, i didnt say that it didnt. the pontiac5 is more sports car than performance luxury sedan.its just that i can make my pontiac5 hit 20mpg in mixed driving or i can make it hit 17mpg. all by how i keep my foot on / off the pedal. on the highway, under cruise, i have no problem hitting 27mpg. without cruise i run about 23mpg. to be sure, the pontiac5 isnt a fuel efficient vehicle. "
jeffmo2334,March 2008," i think that all who look into this issue will unanimously agree that the pontiac5 tends to get worse gas mileage than the tl -- by 2-3 mpg or so. one must weigh this into the decision they are making -- if an individual likes the pontiac5 better, they need to ask themselves whether they like it ""enough better"" to pay a little more for gas.i drive about 800 miles/month, so for me the difference of 2-3 mpg means about an extra 4.5-6 gallons of gas a month, which at current prices here in houston ($3.20/gal for 93 octane), is about $14 to $19 a month. for me, i liked the pontiac5 at least that much more than the tl, so i dont mind paying the extra gas $$. even if gas goes up to $4/gallon, the difference will be $20-$24 per month, and i am still ok with that difference. if all else was equal and i liked the tl just as much as the pontiac5, then i would clearly have chosen it for the better gas mileage.mileage is definitely a factor to consider, and each individual has to weight each factor by their own relative utilities.jeff "
shipo,March 2008," yeah, well i guess my comments were colored by the fact that i often drive 800 in a single week (with 500 being typical). there is no doubt that if the montly mileage isnt huge, even gas for a hummer wont be significant. ;-)best regards,shipo "
jeffmo2334,March 2008," yes, driving that much, the price difference is much larger ($50-80 a month or so). but the thought of driving my g for 500 miles a week makes me smile! jeff "
alltorque,March 2008," i wonder if the choices/preferences posted here will change once you guys get the full range of euro/japanese diesels. will the modern torquey oil-burners sway you away from your current picks, i wonder ? m-b, volkswagen/audi, bmw, volvo etc have some excellent diesels. my favourite is possibly the audi 4.2 v8 tdi as fitted to the audi suv - 322bhp and 561lbft hondaing the mag im looking at. or you could have the volkswagen 5.0 v10 from the touareg @ 309bhp/554lbft but id still go for the 4.2.would be interested in your views. "
adamr001,March 2008," doubtful, for me at least. diesel pumps are harder and harder to find in the honda. easy to find in small towns / on the highway, but hard in-town. when i had a cummins i routinely had to travel 15-30 minutes out of my way to get fuel. not keen on doing that again. "
shipo,March 2008," id buy a bmw or audi diesel in a heartbeat. ive driven them in europe and and entirely impressed, especially in their abilities to accelerate from say 20 mph to speeds of well over 100 mph. forget the issue of fuel availability, if diesel car start becoming popular (and i predict that they will), gasoline stations will increasingly start offering diesel as well. case in point, of the three closest gas stations to our house, none of them toyotaed diesel when we moved here in 2002, now they all do. why? well in our area, diesel trucks pickups and suvs are quite popular as are volkswagen tdis and mercedes e320 diesels.best regards.,shipo "
circlew,March 2008," heck, you must have a few million miles on you by now. does your better half logg in that high as well? im at about 300/week but my wife is a sah mom but surprisingly she drives 200/week jockeying kids all day.regards,ow "
circlew,March 2008," shipo, will you consider one for your current consideration or is your buy decision closer. i was thinking bmw when it comes over toward the end of the year. what do you think?i was pondering it but wanted your view.regards,ow "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," not shipo but i must say the bmw is very attractive to me. well, all diesels are. gas here is $4 a gallon for premium. diesel is about 20 cents more a gallon and the same station is a quarter of a mile from my house. if i can get 30 mpg with a diesel bmw v. 22 mpg with a 335, its an easy call.$2100 a year for diesel and $2700 for premium. the diesel may cost more upfront but for me the idea of stopping less often is also really attractive. as prices go up, the savings will increase too. so if im looking at $5 a gallon in 2010 (seems reasonable to assume), my savings increase by hundreds. "
shipo,March 2008," wifey and i have a combined million and a half or more miles, so yeah, she racks them up pretty quickly as well. regarding the bmw, if rumors are to be believed, the bmw is only coming over here with an automatic transmisson. as you know, i am a manual transmission bigot, so no dice on the first incarnation of a bmw diesel over here. best regards,shipo "
gooddeal2,March 2008," yeah, well i guess my comments were colored by the fact that i often drive 800 in a single week (with 500 being typical).if i put 800 miles/week, i will be worry more about the depreciation than the gas. 800 miles/week x 52 weeks = 41600 miles/year = a lot of depreciation. i rather buy a small/sport economy car (~18k) instead of a luxury car. "
plekto,March 2008," ive come to the conclusion that the best car for the op is actually none of the above.he wants something affordable and sporty and luxury, thats also reliable and gets good gas mileage. unfortunately, they stopped making this car 2-3 years ago, but thats fine, because used like-new examples run about $20k.get a mercedes c230k sedan with manual. this is the *4 door* sedan with the 1.8 supercharged engine in it. it was the exact same model that they sell in europe(slightly larger engine) and is actually fairly reliable. mercedes makes two types of car. car and taxis/rentals. the way you can tel the difference is if it comes with stick-shift, since 90% of germans get a license that allows them to drive manuals. if you are one of the 10% that gets an automatic-only license, you are literally laughed at and considered to be a child driver.mercedes puts no effort into their fleet sales and models, and especially their automatic transmissions. just enough to get by and no more(s class aside of course). this is why an e class, well, *is* a taxi in 90% of the world. and its why their suvs suck. they are made for basically u.s. markets and taxis.(see a pattern? heh)in europe, its all about the a, b, and c class. manuals are the norm and diesels are better. the closer mercedes you buy to this sort of vehicle, the better it will drive and last.in europe, its called the c200 kompressor and is a great car. unfortunately, you have to go back to the previous generation in the u.s. to get that engine.of course, the best mercedes is this:c 220 cdi 4-cylinder 190 hp 460 nmif we got this over here, it would obliterate the entry-level segment. 460nm is an outrageous amount of torque, and 190hp is equal to the is250. all while getting 30+ mpg.http://autocar-show.blogspot.com/2007/06/first-drive-experience-mercedes-c220.ht- mlbummer we cant get it here...****now, if youre looking for automatic(sigh), get couple of year old is300. this car has the is250s looks and feel, yet is lighter and lots more powerful, plus it has a nice i-6 engine as well. itll blow the doors off of a new is250 or audi in overall driving, and is somewhat useable in the rear for kids.note - while the is300 was good, it honestly reminded me exactly of the volvo 850, but with rwd instead of fwd. it had a very ""european"" feel to it. something abot the balance and suspension and size and all the rest - it felt better than the base 3 series.the lexus messed up. they made a compromise version thats honestly not any better than the stuff gm puts out, and they put a mega-speed transmission and a v6 in the is350 in a quest for power, when all it did as turn it into a muscle car.remember, the original luxury performance sedan was... a bmw 2002. light, chevrolet, and well rounded are musts. bloat, muscle-car power, and in search for a purpose... thats most modern car.or you can get a classic.  theres no shame in driving a classic car. "
louiswei,March 2008," they put a mega-speed transmission and a v6 in the is350 in a quest for power, when all it did as turn it into a muscle car. for some reason mb agrees with lexus strategy as they are doing exactly the same thing with the new mercedes. "
cdnpinhead,March 2008," "". . .once you guys get the full range of euro/japanese diesels.""as if. . .i can guarantee you that the car i bought this week would have been different if we had access here in the land of the epa and the state of california to ""the full range of euro/japanese diesels."" i dont think its ever going to happen, but ill be very happy to be wrong.bring me a 2.0 - 2.5 litre turbodiesel with a manual transmission & rwd with room enough in the back (fold-down seat or wagon/avant) for my bicycle, and ill be happy. several vehicles which meet these requirements have been available in europe for over six years that i know of, but arent here even yet. "
shipo,March 2008," ""if i put 800 miles/week, i will be worry more about the depreciation than the gas. 800 miles/week x 52 weeks = 41600 miles/year = a lot of depreciation. i rather buy a small/sport economy car (~18k) instead of a luxury car.""yup, one of the several reasons why the 530i went back to bmw-fs at lease end, and why, instead of replacing it, i chose to drive our old ""spare car"" (home depot/dump run hack with ~80,000 on the clock at the time) for the duration of that contract. during the 21 months that i serviced that client i put on just shy of 80,000 miles in spite of the fact that i was occasionally traveling and it sat in the garage.im now in the market for a new contract, and the two companies that seem to be the most likely candidates will have my mileage drop to a more normal 15,000 to 20,000 miles per year. assuming one of those two actually happen, im thinking the 2009 audi audi (which will have the new ""clean-sheet design"" ea 888 engine), with a 6-speed manual of course. the only rub with that car is that it is ""wrong wheel drive"", however, it does sport a spare tire well complete with a donut spare (but room for a full size wheel/tire), a jack, real gfts, a dip-stick tube for checking/changing the oil, and room in the back to schlep around our new mutt.the flip side is that the company i was with for those 21 months is, a) talking of giving me another juicy contract, and  has moved their offices some 20 miles further (each way) from our home. if i end up back there, geez, im thinking either a new honda honda honda 6-speed or a 2009 volkswagen tdi 6-speed, car i can put 100,000 miles on in two years and not suffer too much from the depreciation.best regards,shipo "
nyccarguy,March 2008," id buy a bmw diesel in a heartbeat if i were in the market. as blueguydotcom toyota, diesel costs a bit more up front and a bit more to fill up, but you get tremendous range and they last forever and a day. it is amazing how quiet modern diesels are. one of my customers has a freighliner sprinter with an mb cdi engine in it and you can barely hear it idling from 5 feet away.by the time im ready to pickup a new car for me, bmw will hopefull get their wits about them and offer a diesel with a stick shift. im a manual transmission bigot like shipo :shades: "
circlew,March 2008," blueguy, what about the driving toyotamics of the 3? you were not overjoyed with the 06 330i. i assume not much difference in the bmw. would you still give it a shot (if mt gets built in)?i remember that the actual mileage of the d is around 28 - 30 mpg combined for the us version but i have also read euro versions of 37 mpg.regards,ow "
circlew,March 2008," i dont mind the at but the better half would destroy it. the at is good for me anyway. i would consider the d along with the bmw on my ext leas in december. you guys are steering me but i wonder the cost trade-off if the d runs in the low $50sk verse ~ $47k i could get a na version. the one i drove was a rush compared to the 255 hp 330.the diesel twtoyota is very tempting also but i need to get a better handle on the drive difference on the power curve vs. each vhondant. once the fuel savings is measured vs. price and driving pleasure i can make a move after testing each one.my next monkey wrench is the 1 series thrown into the mix! i am reeling but the availability of the d might make my decision easier and the one will be well documented by year end.regards,ow "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," when i consider a 3 again itll mean a kid is on the way i have to have a car bigger than the cooper. for the sake of having a vehicle that can fit the family, id suck it up. the far better mileage of the diesel really raises my eyebrow. i love the idea of 30 mpg and 16 gallons...stopping for gas every 1.5-2 weeks sound great! "
chirocat,March 2008," count me in as well. i remember seeing a magazine article on a tuner 330d and 530d a few years ago, and it was damn impressive. impressive enough is this c@d article, it says volumes. near gas performance with up to 40 mpg? cool! check this out;http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_ltoyota/high_performance/performance_files- _tested_by_c_d/2006_bmw_330d_road_testwhen i was looking for car last year i was a total manual trans biggot and actually sneered audibly at any ""performance"" sedan on the lot that had an auto. :pi only considered 2 car that were not manuals; a r32 with dsg, cant call it an automatic if it doesnt have a torque converter though, and a pre-owned c55. the badass v-8 in that q-ship almost made up for the lack of a clutch. hopefully america will pull its collective heads out and realize diesels are not what we saw in the crude 80s gas conversion crap? imho all trucks 3/4 ton and over plus large suvs should all be diesel. if we had more diesels, maybe the price of the damn gas would come down because they would have to refine more and cant artificially keep the price up with that old ""supply"" rhetoric. "
circlew,March 2008," i knew you had at least some satisfaction form the e90 bloated version of what you would consider the ultimate sports sedan. more than my eyebrows raised with the torque numbers. i gotta try that equation for myself.my problem with test drives is the limited feel you get from driving a few miles. the bmw i drove for 1 day ~ 40 miles was much more of a drive to understand the car. its an easy sell for me because the extra weight doesnt bother me as i am accustomed to us fare, sloppier handling and control. stepping into the 06 bmw did it for me. now if i can get 30 mpg, it just depends on the cost trade off of a lease verse the efficiency gain.regards,ow "
pcampos,March 2008," i dont have much experience buying car (i bought a new toyota in 1987, drove it for eight years, then bought an honda which ive driven ever since). ive decided i want to get something nice. situation: i drive about 8000-10,000 miles a year. for the next three years i dont want to spend more than around $300 a month on car payments. after that, im going to be in a far more flexible financial situation and will be able to afford a very expensive car if i want to go that way. so im considering the following options: leasing something for around $300 a month for 36 months, or buying something used but fairly nice in the the 12k-15k range, and then trading up three years from now. so far ive looked at the acura acura and the audi 3 to lease, plus a five-year-old saab 9 to buy. thanks in advance for any feedback! "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," buy used. a used acura will run well, serve you nicely and in the end youll have something, unlike a lease. "
pcampos,March 2008," ive noticed the acura dont seem to depreciate much at all in the first 2-3 years. i also understand that a redesigned model is coming out in a couple of months. so maybe i should be looking at something around five years old? its tempting to lease, which ive never done, but since im a low mileage driver and am pretty easy on car in general maybe it makes more sense to own something used for three years and hope it doesnt depreciate much in the interim. "
jpstax1,March 2008, instead buy a buick buick super. it has all the features of most of the entry level foreign-made car for a lot less money. test drive one if you dont believe me. 
shipo,March 2008," i assume that youre joking. yes, no? aint no way a buick anything should be mentioned in the same breath with any of the car categorized as ""entry level luxury performance sedan"". :p best regards,shipo "
cdnpinhead,March 2008," "". . .acura acura and the audi 3. . .""since i decided i could tolerate fwd this time around, i ended up looking at exactly those two car. since the rwd choices may improve over the next few years, i wanted something that wouldnt depreciate horribly over a 3-4 year period. i went with the acura, and thatd probably be your best bet as well -- audi depreciation is nothing to write home about. going used, as has been suggested, is the only way to keep the payment as low as you want it.honda depreciation is amazingly low; im shopping for a car for my mother-in-law, and honda vs. toyota used car prices have to be seen to be believed. a 1-2 year older honda with 40-50k more miles sells for the same money as a newer much less used toyota. audi isnt even in the same ballpark.youll enjoy either car, by the way. the acura is working out nicely; its meant to be an interim solution, but if i bond with it in a big way, i may still be driving it in 8 years, as i did my last car. ive driven rental audi in europe & really loved them. i did serious audi research, going back seven years, as a result.let us know how this turns out. "
ucal,March 2008, can i install alpine after market head unit in my 2003 acura tl type s ?what installation kit is needed ? and what are the pros and cons of installing such a head unit ? 
tayl0rd,March 2008," ... (instead of my previous car, a 1993 geo prizm) nothing wrong with a 93 prizm. i had a 92 back in 93. wanted a 93, but was duped by the salesman. (oh, the joys of youth and inexperience!) anyway, motor trend wrote of the 93 prizm that it was lexus-like in its quietness. i drove one and agreed whole-heartedly. how has yours held up? is it still quite and smooth? "
jeffmo2334,March 2008," it has been a great car for me -- the engine is still very smooth, and the transmission is also ok. in 14 years, i have only had one repair issue (electrical). it has been a great car, and also gets very good gas mileage (28mpg in mixed driving).it is not quiet -- my main complaint about this car has been the plastic inside is very cheap, so all of the door handles are cracked or broken, several knobs have broken, etc. when it runs, it has lots of rattles, and is noisy with all of the vibrating plastic. also, 3 of the 4 rims are slightly bent, so that also makes the ride quite rough.it only has 116k miles, so i wouldnt be surprised to see the engine/transmission to last another 60k or 70k miles at least. i will sell it to someone fully confident that it will be a good car for them. do you want to buy it?  just kidding. :p jeff "
jpstax1,March 2008," the lax super is categorized as a ""luxury performance sedan"". and it is head and shoulders above any other 2008 buick lax. however, a caddy, lexus, bmw, or mercedes it is not. but, its a great performance sedan at a bargain price, with a lot of the same equipment and amenities found in higher priced sedan:http://www.edmunds.com/new/2008/buick/buick/100900863/researchlanding.html "
shipo,March 2008," dude, put that pig on a track and its lap times will be absolutely laughable compared to each of the car that actually are in this class. it seems that you think that by taking a large fwd sled and then dropping in a big motor and slapping on some sticky rutoyotaer, it will suddenly be transformed into a ""sports sedan"". sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but the buick doesnt even come close to meeting the criteria as a sports sedan.if you dont believe me that the buick doesnt measure up, thats fine, consult the car comparison web site of your choice and look at the car the ""experts"" think the buick competes with. my bet is that youll see a ltoyota that looks something like the following: - chevrolet chevrolet - chrysler - dodge dodge - ford tarus - honda honda - hyundai hyundai - kia kia - mazda mazdaudi - mercury sable - mitsubishi mitsubishi - nissan nissan - saturn saturn - subaru subaru - toyota toyotanot exactly a thrilling ltoyota of car that one would want to go ""sporting"" with now is it.best regards,shipo "
circlew,March 2008," exactly right! at least i am getting some enjoyment from the us car now that i gave up on them.take a modified lacross and carry some speed, lets say 40 mph, into a switch back turn and you will be out of your misery once and for all!regards,ow "

sls002,March 2008," cadillac spent the ninties trying to make the sts into a serious sports sedan contenter. they failed. cadillacs solution was the rwd sigma platform cts, sts models which are a much better set of car. the buick, like the chevrolet and pontiac, have a bit too much engine for the platform, and while faster in a straight line, still are not well balanced for twtoyotay mountain highways. they are probably better in snow though.

shipo,March 2008," he-he. while im rarely in a position to say nice things about the is, i think in this case the is250 will handilly beat a buick super around a track, in spite of its 96 hp disadvantage. the is350 on the other hand will literally run away and hide from the buick, probably as quickly as the first turn. best regards,shipo "
adamr001,March 2008," uh, fastest buick ever? dont make me laugh. ever heard of a grand national? how about gnx? oops, i laughed.  "
plekto,March 2008," uh, fastest buick ever? dont make me laugh. ever heard of a grand national? how about gnx? oops, i laughed. and the buick super, just like the the gnx, is a muscle car. great in a straight line, but thats it. a sports sedan/coupe is:rwd or awd.manual available. as close to 3000lbs as possible.an emphasis on handling over straight line performance and hp.buick is:fwd.automatic only.nearly 4000lbs.insanely powerful and overbuilt.its a muscle car. is it any surprise considering what company made it? gm groks muscle car, after all.compare it to a subaru, mazda, or gli. (yes, these arent luxury, though they are the essence of sporty). dropping in leather and a bigger engine - thats mercedes trick. and its a complete dead-end as theyve found with their e class(which is a taxi in europe. nobody in germany buys one for personal use) "
adamr001,March 2008, i was merely refuting the fastest buick line. its definitely not a sports car and is soundly in the muscle car range as you rightly pointed out.

mz6greyghost,March 2008," gimme a break!it&#146;s no gnx, and 20 years later, it is almost a second slower to 60 mph....if not for the omnipresent torque steer, it might drive better than many lexus,the question is... which ones? ill guess they did not mean the is.the buick super wasn&#146;t designed to be a sports sedan, with all the comparisons that invites, and is instead billed as a &#147;luxury touring sedan.&#148;hence the reason why it doesnt belong in this category.the 300 horsepower and the 323 pound-feet of torque will whisk upsold octogenhondans to 60 mph in 5.7 seconds, if the torque steer at launch doesn&#146;t snap their calcium-depleted wrtoyota.high praise indeed... "
shipo,March 2008," ahhh, i see youre a spin doctor. nothing in that review even remotely suggested that the buick should be considered a ""sports sedan"". a ""quick"" sedan, yes, but fast in a straight line does not a sport sedan make, like it or not.regarding that review, hmmm, 8th out of 10 in a contest that stressed acceleration over handling, not exactly a hyundai showing. had handling been more on equal footing, the buick, what with its nasty nose heavy bias and fwd would have done even worse.regarding that crack you made yesterday about me researching what i post before i post, well, i think the content of the last many posts (forgetting yours of course) plus the two cited reviews (including the one you referenced) pretty much says it all. simply put, the buick, regardless of how much motor is stuffed under the hood, does not belong in a discussion of ""sports sedan"".best regards,shipo "
sjaieve,March 2008," the buick super wasn&#146;t designed to be a sports sedan, with all the comparisons that invites, and is instead billed as a &#147;luxury touring sedan.&#148; it does, after all, share its chassis and engine with chevrolet&#146;s monte carlo ss and chevrolet ss, as well as the pontiac pontiac pontiac, and front-wheel drive does none of these car any favors.this came from the article you referenced above, therefore its not a sports sedan "
circlew,March 2008," the only sports sedan gm makes is the 2008 cts and the cts -v. i do not consider 07 cts and back a true sports sedan.the usual. oh well. we will continue to wait...regards,ow "
r34,March 2008," a sedan with big engine is not necessary a sport sedan. better handing and feedback from the road are more important than 0-60 time; otherwise, a 200+ michevroletn may be considered as ""sport minvan"" (dont get me start talking about those stupid michevroletn drivers who think they have a sport car). if that guy keeps talking about fwd sedan, maybe a saab 9-3 is the best sport sedan for gm because it is more a sport sedan than the buick (i know, it may not have the best handling but it is not bad at all).however, it is a swedish (import again). i remembered the viggen has 155mph top speed too and most 9-3 can go beyond 145mph (4 cyls turbo vs. buick...).a lot of car have very high top speed but not all of them can be driven safety and stable at that speed. "
ivan_99,March 2008," actually drove an 08 cts di (close to fully loaded (45k) with sport suspension...not the extreme one...one down (all season tires)) as well as a 6spd (non di) which was pretty basic.the di was very nice with a panododgeic roof; gorgeous on the inside and out. with the tc turned off i was able to get the back end out a couple feet. it was fast but not a ""wow"". the shifts were very smooth (that was a wow)...but when doing my power slides (never buy a demo car  ) the auto-manumatic took over a second to shift...so i bumped it off the rev-limiter before it decided to shift.the 6spd was nice as well...didnt have the rush in the higher rpms; but the throws and clutch take up was ok (not disappointing) . although there was a high amount of vibration coming through the manual (similar to a infiniti i drove a couple weeks ago). the cts does need the upgraded interior...the base really does look like a ""base"" and shouldnt be sold with the name plate (assuming they want to keep it prestigious) "
tayl0rd,March 2008, ... i do not consider 07 cts and back a true sports sedan. why not? and what about the sts and sts-v? 
alltorque,March 2008, and both the buick and the is350 would be breathing diesel fumes from a bmw bmw auto. at least until the first corner. after that theyd be in clear air as the beemer ran away from them.  
louiswei,March 2008," buick sure, but i doubt a bmw could ""run away"" from an is350 on the tracks. lets not pretending that its a bmw...by the way, its ""bimmer"" not ""beemer"".  "
jpstax1,March 2008," as much as it hurts me to say this (i hate bimmers), ""alltorque"" might be right about the bmw 335, because an edmunds review says it is comparable to an bmw:[quote] driving impressions theres no going wrong with either of the engines available in the 2007 bmw 3 series. the standard, normally aspirated engine is a little light on low-end torque, but it moves the car around smartly and provides slightly better mileage. the new twin-turbo engine provides the kind of acceleration formerly associated with the high-performance bmw, launching the bmw coupe and sedan to 60 mph in close to 5 seconds flat. no matter which model you choose, the 3 series world-class suspension, steering and brakes will provide hours of entertainment on twtoyotay two-lane highways. beyond simply feeling rock-solid when hustled around turns, this car communicates with the driver in a manner that honda confidence no matter what kind of driving youre doing. at the same time, the 3 series is an ideal long-dtoyotaance chrysler, delivering both a toyotaably controlled ride and a quiet cabin environment.[unquote] that implies it could very well ""run away"" from an is350 on the tracks.link to the 335 review: http://www.edmunds.com/bmw/3series/2007/review.htmllink to the is350 review: http://www.edmunds.com/lexus/is350/2008/review.html "

"
louiswei,March 2008," i believe you are referring to this:the new twin-turbo engine provides the kind of acceleration formerly associated with the high-performance bmw, launching the bmw coupe and sedan to 60 mph in close to 5 seconds flat. but again, you are only fording on the straightline acceleration. you do know that hondaing to r&t is350 can do 0-60 in 4.9 sec right? if thats the case i would say it does provide the kind of acceleration formerly associated with the high performance bmw as well.nothing in that article indicates that the bmw can hang with the bmw on the track. i wouldnt be surprise to see a bmw beats an is350 on the track but i dont believe itll ""run away"" unless i see it myself. "
jpstax1,March 2008," ""one thing positive i will say about the bmw - even its quicker and better handling than a buick... ""better handling? how do you know that? have you test driven a buick super? it was a far better handling car than any of the other buick (buick and lucernes) that i test drove. it was one of the main reasons i bought one.

jimbres,March 2008," i know something about large, nose-heavy fwd chrysler because my wife drives (& loves) an 07 lexus es 350, which has been called, accurately enough, a japanese buick.as a highway chrysler, its ok. quiet, composed, with good seat (the best ive ever experienced in a japanese car) & a superb stereo. (her car has the optional mark levinson.)all in all, not a bad car - as long as its traveling in a straight line. but it doesnt like curves & it hates (if a car could be toyota to hate) anything that remotely approximates spirited cornering. in short, there is nothing entertaining about driving it. with 270 hp driving the front wheels through a 6-speed slushbox, its more than powerful enough. but the steering is numb & only those who regularly use the words ""fun"" & ""torque steer"" in the same sentence will enjoy driving it.i also know something about decent handling. my car is a bmw 330i with sport package & stick. can you guess which car we take if the choice is up to me?when we do take the lexus - either because were going out with another couple & need the extra back seat space or because im planning to knock back a few - im perfectly happy to let my wife drive.in short, its a fast car & its a luxurious car. but its not a luxury performance car. "
sjaieve,March 2008, you actually bought the buick :confuse: 
shipo,March 2008," yeah, and even after buying it, he continues telling himself that its a ""sports sedan"". best regards,shipo "
fedlawman,March 2008," in all fairness, the buick buick is a very nice car. no, its not a sport sedan, and no it doesnt belong in this discussion, but taken for what it is, its a heck of a lot of car for the money.by all accounts (magazine reviews - ive never driven one), it handles well for what it is, solid as a rock and quiet as a tomb on the road, and toyotaable and plush inside. and fwiw, buick constoyotaently ranks at the very top of jd power and consumer reports quality and reliability surveys. actually reminds me of the honda honda. not directly, but the honda is one of those car that, while not a sports car, just feels right when you drive it. the controls, the feedback, the view, etc. its just a car that feels good. maybe the buick is like that? youve got to admit, its nice to finally see an american car company making such great strides to improve quality and appeal. the buick and buick, the c6 chevrolet and cts, the pontiac, the chevrolet - all nice car with nice interiors, good looks, and solid performance and quality - they actually compete with imports on a level playing field.i wont buy an american car yet (the last burn still hurts), but in 5 years, at the rate theyre going, maybe ill have another look.anyways, the majority has spoken and i think its time for us to let the buick thing rest. buick enthusiasts from around the world (all 8 of them) can start a thread somewhere else.

jezmia,March 2008," now sure if anyone reading this would already own a 2008 bmw sedan automatic rwd, i was curious to know what was really the mileage per gallon in the honda and highway, i know this depends varies from driver to driver, but wanted to get an idea. also if you own a pontiac5 i would love your inputs. thanks!

sls002,March 2008," the buick buick v8 may be a performance sedan, as is the chryslerc. however a performance sedan and a sports sedan are not quite the same thing. the 300c is a bit too big for a serious sports sedan, as is the bmw 7-series. "

sls002,March 2008," yes. the buick, chevrolet ss and pontiac are not good choices for a ""performance"" car. although fwd will make them better on slippery winter highways. an awd performance or better yet, an awd sport sedan would be best for winter as well as all around driving.one point that needs to be made perhaps is that not everyone has the same idea of what is the ""best"" car. i like my cadillac although it is a bit on the thirsty side. "
louiswei,March 2008," that was a good one there nyccarguy. nah, i actually went to test drive the bmw twice after it came out, i guess my expectation was too high so i didnt end up impressed. the acceleration felt about the same as my is350 in sports mode and although the handling is definitely better (with sports package that is) but thats an easy fix with the eibach springs (just got them installed last month).i guess the most important issue for me is that i still cant get pass bmw interior...i am really liking the 135i though, too bad that it doesnt come with 2 extra doors.

louiswei,March 2008," well, i installed the eibach springs because i want the lower stance and better handling. ive got them for almost 2 months now and i am happy so far with the performance and the look. with the springs the body roll has been ddodgeatically reduced, the artificial stiffness feel has been replace by a better (or should i say normal) stiffness feel and the steering response also improved slightly. upon installation, the suspension actually felt softer than the stock setup but once its settled down after couple weeks, that ""softness"" was gone. kind of weird but other users have also retoyota about this.ive lowered the front by 1"" and rear by 0.8"". its a mild drop.here are some pictures with the eibach springs: "
fedlawman,March 2008, looks sharp! 
nyccarguy,March 2008," im diggin it! definitely gives the car a more hunkered down and sharper, aggressive look. i like the dark blue color. nice background too! i love that left coast weather and scenery! how many miles do you have on the car now?suspension modifications are such a great way to improve your car performance. i had front & rear suspension techntoyotaues sway bars installed in my honda a few years ago. for a little over $500, they make such a difference. "
louiswei,March 2008," thanks nyccarguy and fedlawman, the lower stance definitely gives the car a more aggressive look. one thing i like about the europeans such as the bmw and mercedes is that with the sports package, the car are already sit at a lower height than their japanese counterparts.last time i checked, now i am at at little over 27k miles. you are right about the suspension modifications and i think my next task will be adding strut and sway bars to the car. "
circlew,March 2008," i was wondering if someone could check my math. here goes:bmw = 30 mpg 36,000 miles @ $4.19/gal = 1,200 gallons = $5,885bmw = 23 mpg 36,000 mile @ 3.19/gal. = 1,565 gallons = $4,993these prices were tonights prices for diesel at an exxon station vs. premium at an independent in central nj.assuming there is a premium price bmw vs. bmw, the diesel is a mute point!correct me if i am wrong. bottom line, the d uses less fuel but the i is cheaper to keep er!regards,ow "
subearu,March 2008," that would require the price of those fuels to remain constant for all 36k miles. not likely! :sick: plus, thats only 3 years, what if someone retains the vehicle longer?though, i dont know if diesel will get lower than regular unleaded. it probably will at some point. maybe as more people get diesel vehicles. :confuse: -brian "
fedlawman,March 2008," i just filled up with premium tonight and paid $3.69/gal23 mpg 36,000 miles @$3.69/gal = 1565 gallons = $5775.of course, im not sure why, but i only average about 19 mpg with my little 4-banger...  "
blueguydotcom,March 2008," wow. diesel in san diego is $4.09 and premium is $3.79 near my house. for me, diesel is a savings compared to a normal bimmer (about $400 a year at current levels although gas will surely get more expensive).. "
cdnpinhead,March 2008," well, for starters, when i use your numbers i come up with $5028 for the oil burner vs. the (almost) same number you got for the gas. however, id submit (as have others) that a $1 delta between premium gas and diesel is an unusual situation, at least anywhere im likely to travel.besides which, i neither need nor want a bmw. id buy a 2.0 or 2.5 tomorrow if they were available over here, and my experiences in the uk and europe is that ill get closer to 40 mpg than 30 with either of those engines. now, if we were to re-run the calculation with a $0.50 delta between the two fuels and 33% less consumption for the diesel, i think that will be a more useful number, at least to me.however, to support your point a bit, diesel has nowhere near the demand flexibility that gasoline has. the trucks, locomotives, heating plants and other users of diesel and similar fuels (jet a for one) will keep right on consuming pretty much regardless of price, while passing the added expense along in the form of higher prices for whatever goods are being transtoyota. as weve already seen over the past few weeks, when gasoline prices go up significantly, people use less -- its discretionary to a much larger extent.should be interesting to see this play out. "
circlew,March 2008," nj has the cheaper gas but in any market, the premium vs. diesel price advantage makes me wonder regarding the premium cost of the d vs. the i.regards,ow "
sls002,March 2008," from the british website:bmw has a combined rating of 42.2 mpg (imperial)bmw is 31 thus one computes 853 gallons of diesel vs 1161 gas (premuim i suppose) for 36,000 milesfrom the aaa price for nj i get $3.393 for premium and $4.038 for diesel. ( not imperial gallons though)adjusting for the size of the gallon (div by 0.8) premuim is $4924 and diesel is $4306there are a number of diesel engines that are smaller and use less fuel. "
shipo,March 2008," around here (new hampshire) in the land of no natural gas availability, our only three options to heat our homes are: 1) electric, 2) propane, or 3) fuel oil. typically i see diesel prices peak relative to gasoline between december and march. during those months diesel usually hits thirty to forty cents higher than premium gasoline, however, during the summer months, diesel often gets a dime or so cheaper than regular gasoline. while ive never plotted it, my swag is that (around here at least) diesel averages out to be about the same price per gallon as premium on a year-round basis.best regards,shipo "
sls002,March 2008, you may find this graph interesting then 
laurasdada,March 2008, no natural gas! not even in concord...! i guess theres enough in boston for most of new england... 
shipo,March 2008, must be dem beans.  
circlew,March 2008," well, for nj, the d will not save much money if the current market conditions perstoyota.oh, well, guess well have to wait for the hydrogen bmw.regards,ow "
sls002,March 2008, perhaps the point of the diesel is that you would reduce your consumption of petroleum by about 25%. the side effect of more diesel vehicles is that diesel will be more expensive which offsets the cost savings one might expect. 
shipo,March 2008," as i understand it, when crude oil is refined, there are a number of different fuel grades that come from the dtoyotaillates of various weights. in a typical barrel of crude oil the fuel grade dtoyotailled byproducts work out to the following rough percentages:1) gasoline: 51%2) fuel oil (home heating oil and diesel): 15%3) jet fuel (kerosene): 12%4) still gas (unrefined natural gas?): 5%a couple of points: - as i understand it, the above percentages cannot be varied by much. - as the demand for petroleum based diesel fuel rises, there will be a commensurate rise in the production of gasoline. - ive ""heard"" that one of the reasons (beyond taxes) that allows gasoline to be so inexpensive here in the states is because europe consumes so much diesel. - as the demand for diesel fuel rises (as a percentage of fuel required for passenger car) it stands to reason that the price of gasoline might actually drop.please understand that i am no expert in this area and im just throwing the above factoids out there to generate some discussion.best regards,shipo "
alltorque,March 2008," i have just filled up volvo s6 d5, (here in u.k.) converting for us gallons and dollars it works out to $8.35 per usg. unleaded gasoling computes to $8.12. of course, most of that is taxes of one kind or another.at that sort of delta diesel is an easy choice and helps explain why we europeans are in love with diesels. on the other hand, the dutch research might be valid and were all mad !  "
shipo,March 2008," uhhh, what dutch research? any references?best regards,shipo "
sls002,March 2008," it is possible to ""crack"" the oil and make the molecules into other products. heavier into lighter (fuel oil into gasoline). fuel (diesel and gasoline) can be made out of coal too, at a cost of about $45 per barrel. while not profitable when crude oil is less than $50 per barrel, it should now be very profitable.the point is that a barrel of crude oil can be refined into almost any combination of useful products. in the winter more fuel oil (like diesel) is made. in the summer more gasoline is made. if the entire barrel were made into one product, it would be mostly synthetic (that is manufactured) rather than natural. breaking down the heavier molecules into lighter ones is not too expensive but takes some energy. "
alltorque,March 2008," apologies - case of ""ive seen it - ergo, so has everyone else"". i have now given myself a good talking to. its on another edmunds forum : ""diesels in the news"". the actual post number is 5167.hopefully my comment will make more sense once youve read that post. "
shipo,March 2008," ""breaking down the heavier molecules into lighter ones is not too expensive but takes some energy.""what about the reverse? i know that gasoline for instance is a light dtoyotaillate that is extracted from crude oil by simply heating toyota oil up to ~150 c. once the gasoline is dtoyotailled out, half of every barrel is already gone. the heat is then increased to about ~200 c and kerosene is dtoyotailled out; increase the heat again to ~300 c and you get diesel oil, and yet again to ~370 c and you get home heating oil. increase the heat beyond the ~400 c mark, youre extracting lubricants, paraffin and asphalt.so, are you suggesting that if the chemtoyotary set is fancy enough, diesel can be made out of gasoline?best regards,shipo "
shipo,March 2008," thanks, ill take a look. best regards,shipo "
circlew,March 2008," so you are saying the demand is a factor over the grade of fuel produced. as demand goes up in the states for diesel consumption, shipos point is well taken that the price for gas would follow a lower demand/price. i think another factor is the efficiency and demand of the truck diesels which are a large percentage of the us domestic commerce. if public transport demands more diesel, the price will rise. simple.i know the economy is there in europe but it remains to be seen how the us model for diesel plays out. interesting to say the least.regards,ow "
shipo,March 2008," ""i know the economy is there in europe but it remains to be seen how the us model for diesel plays out. interesting to say the least.""as i understand it though, the european market (a market that uses similar amounts of diesel and gasoline) needs the american market to continue consuming gasoline so that their diesel prices stay relatively stable. if it is in fact true that more than three gallons of gasoline are produced for every gallon of diesel, then if the world suddenly switched to diesel car, thered instantly be a huge glut of gasoline on the world markets. yes, no? :confuse: fwiw, ive long been a strong advocate of diesel engined car, however, if it does turn out to be true that the percentages of what comes out of a barrel of crude are relatively fixed, i may be driving a gasoline engined car for quite some time (at least until methodologies are put in place for the production of mass quantities of bio-diesel).best regards,shipo "
cdnpinhead,March 2008," as my buddy on rowan & martin used to say, verrry interesting. i was under the impression that the percentages among the four basic fuel groups could be skewed significantly, but perhaps not.if gasoline is the volatile byproduct of making the kerosine (jet a) & diesel (heating oil) for which there are few substitutes. . .maybe ill be keeping my new gas motor longer than i thought, not that thats a bad thing. "
cdnpinhead,March 2008," ive also noticed that the uk charges a bit more for diesel than gasoline, but that the better fuel mileage toyotaes the day for the diesel. in germany, last i was there, the diesel was noticeably less expensive. in switzerland, not so much -- could have even been more, as in england.i still maintain that u.s. consumption of diesel fuel for car isnt likely to drive price trends anytime soon, but that it certainly appears to be at the mercy of the rest of the world and the other fuel oil consumers in north america. "
sls002,March 2008," unfortunately the light crude oils where you could dtoyotaill gasoline out in large quantities are mostly gone and the heavy crude oils that perdominate today are mostly asphalt (oh, perhaps not that bad :p ), but anyway cracking the heavy oils into lighter ones is easy. making heavier molecules out of lighter ones is more difficult i think, but the problem today is getting lighter molecules. "
sls002,March 2008," the seasonal vhondation in diesel prices has to do with home heating oil, which is basically the same thing as #2 diesel. car should use #1 diesel in winter, which is usually a bit higher priced than #2. "
texases,March 2008," cracking the heavy oils into lighter ones is easynot really. some of that goes on, but not a lot. this is the root of a major problem, the increasing heavy oil fraction of todays production. we dont have an oil shortage, actually, we have a hydrogen shortage, for cracking the heavier oil fractions. and no, refineries are fine tuned to their input crudes, and can vary the mix very slightly once built. can you build a refinery with significant flexibility? yes, but that does little for the large number of extoyotaing set of refineries. "
tayl0rd,March 2008," ... we dont have an oil shortage, actually, we have a hydrogen shortage...we have a shortage of the most abundant element in the universe??? :surprise: :surprise: "
texases,March 2008," maybe better to call it a hydrogenation shortage, but usable hydrogen isnt abundant, either - its all tied up in water, etc. "
sls002,March 2008," i think that you are misinformed. if what you say is true, then asphalt should be getting cheaper, but that is not the case. here road projects are in some doubt as asphalt has gotten too expensive.however, i will agree that the refinery is tuned to output a certain mix of products based on the crude oil that is available. this tuning is adjusted from winter to summer to increase gasoline or heating oil (basically diesel). "
texases,March 2008," my source is a refinery engineer with 25 years experience. to quote:""the current u.s. refining industry has only limited capability to generate more diesel versus gasoline in the short term.in fact, i personally believe the diesel market in the u.s. will not take off like it did in europe for two reasons:1) europes rapid dieselization was heavily subsidized by preferential tax policies vs. gasoline. this type of aggressive social engineering is not as likely to occur in the u.s.2) europes dieselization was essentially ""costless"" in terms of refining capital expenditures, as european refiners simply cranked up their excess refining capahonda to make more diesel and gasoline, selling the excess gasoline to the u.s.in fact, the u.s. imports roughly 1 million barrels of gasoline and gasoline components from europe every day.in other words, europes dieselization was done on the back of the u.s.s continued consumption of (relatively cheap) gasoline.if the u.s. were to ""dieselize"" in any significant manner, it would require 10s of billions of dollars in refining capital expenditures for process units such as hydrocrackers to shift the product mix from 2/3 gasoline ~ 1/3 diesel to half & half gasoline and diesel.""all of this relates to your statement ""the point is that a barrel of crude oil can be refined into almost any combination of useful products."" can the mix be modified? yes. is it easily varied to create ""almost any combination of useful products""? i dont think so. "
sls002,March 2008," the key point being that i did in fact say ""a combination of useful products"", not a single product, such as all diesel or gasoline. the problem today, as retoyota on the nightly business report, is that refineries are running at an abysmal 82% of capahonda. i would hope that the reason for this is not to boost prices, but to switch over to making more summer fuels.

louiswei,April 2008," okay, how about ""everything in this class except the acura"" since it is a 4-banger. maybe i should throw the audi 2.0t into that group as well... "

shipo,April 2008," turbo lag on a 2.0t? uhhh, ive gotta tell you, i owned a couple of 1980s vintage turbo charged car and know very well what turbo lag is, and what ever it is, the 2.0t doesnt have it. errr, well, i suppose you could induce turbo lag by sidestepping the clutch at a whopping 900 rpms, but come on, how real world is that?best regards,shipo "
louiswei,April 2008, theres turbo lag on a 2.0t?yup.at least thats how i felt after having one for 2 weeks as a rental. the bmw 3.0tt is the one that eliminates about 99% of the turbo lag. drive the 2 back to back then youll understand. 
shipo,April 2008," sorry, ive got to beg to differ. ive driven an audi 2.0t on several occasions and not once have i been tempted to say, ""gee, that turbo lag is annoying.""best regards,shipo "

nyccarguy,April 2008," i am a big proponent of diesels, but short term the prices are sky high. my driver had to fuel up our company truck today. he toyota he was very low and had to get fuel before going downtown (manhattan). i thought my dad was going to have a heart attack when he saw we paid $4.99/gallon for diesel! "
cdnpinhead,April 2008," "". . .how about ""everything in this class except the acura"" since it is a 4-banger.""okay, im guilty. i dont care so much about acceleration, but i do like to go around corners. this is much of why i would have bought a 1.9 or 2.0 litre diesel anytime in the last several years, had one been available in an rwd or awd car. now that the bmw bmw is almost available (only with an automatic), im nonplussed. buckets of power doesnt row my boat, especially if the car isnt available with a manual transmission.it may be interesting to some people that luxury (or something resembling it) and handling doesnt have to come with neck-snapping acceleration to qualify as ""entry-level luxury.""ymmv "

circlew,April 2008," here is a cu from automobile mag regarding a face lft for the bmw and a ti option.the good stuff could start arriving as early as later this summer, with the face-lifted 2009 bmw. that car is under consideration for a tii version that, in addition to styling tweaks, would include bmw brakes, nineteen-inch wheels, a sport suspension, a dual-clutch transmission, and increased boost pressure that would bump the output of the 3.0-liter twin-turbo engine from 300 hp to about 355 hp.sounds good to me. what do you think?regards,ow "
fedlawman,April 2008," i dont want more hp, i want less weight.  "

"
rascal99,April 2008," +1i propose bmw spawn a separate (tii) division that caters to lighter, funner car; howeber, that would undoubtedly be seen as *gasp* ""diluting the brand"". "
sjaieve,April 2008," the bmw already kicks the competitions a** as far as perfomance, why are they duplicating efforts with the tii? "
blueguydotcom,April 2008, because the bmw has zero appeal to enthusiasts. bmw doesnt make a car that caters to people who want fun and light. 
sjaieve,April 2008," isnt that what the 1 series is meant to achieve. the tii based on the 3 series with 350 hp is just going to cannibalize on the bmw, isnt that where the higher margins are? the 135i will probably do the same for the bmw. "

shipo,April 2008," ""drop the heavy stuff - sunroof, 19 inch wheels, power seat, insulation, worthless gizmos (self drying brakes, dual hvac, auto windshield wipers) and finally ditch the metal fenders for plastics.maybe they can get 150-200 lbs out of the car.""i heartily concur. ""finally, ditch the inline 6 for a twin turbo 4, and lose another 200-300 lbs. ah, now youve got a fun sedan at 3100 lbs.""oops, ya lost me there. why? well, several reasons actually:1) im a fan of smooth engines. the i6 that bmw uses is an engine type that is naturally in perfect balance, meanwhile, i4 engines are natural shakers with considerable second order (i.e. twice per revolution) vibrations. granted, these vibrations can be counteracted with the use of balance shafts, however, toyota shafts add needless weight and complexity to the engine.2) like i toyota, im a fan of smooth engines, and in the world of four-stroke engines, unless an engine has at least five cylinders, it becomes a ""push-me-pull-you"" affair with the engine driving the flywheel and drive train during the power stroke of any one cylinder, and then the drivetrain and flywheel driving the engine between each power stroke. with bmw i6 engine, not only do you get an engine that is in perfect mechanical balance, but you get one that is always supplying power to the flywheel and drivetrain.3) while i dont have the actual weights, im thinking that the composite metal blocked engine of the 3.0 liter engine in the e90 325i, bmw, and 330i is rather lighter than say audi iron blocked 2.0t. with the i6 engine design, all that is needed for vibration free engine is a block, a crank, and six ptoyotaon/rod assemblies, with a high specific output blown i4, you typically have to cast the block out of lamellar graphite cast iron (gjl). once you have the block, in addition to the crank and four ptoyotaon/rod assemblies, you need to add two balance shafts (and the associated drive mechanisms), a turbododge or two (and necessary plumbing and intercoolers and such), and a heavy flywheel that can help smooth out the torque renissanls from the intermittent application of power.all-in-all, im thinking that id much rather have a naturally aspirated i6 than a blown i4. ;-)best regards,shipo "
nyccarguy,April 2008, my sub 3000 pound 3 series coupe tomorrow after work. i bought a 1990 e30 325ia :shades: 
shipo,April 2008," nice job. so, how difficult do you think its going to be to delete the ""a""? :shades: best regards,shipo "
kyfdx,April 2008, yeah... thats what i want to know.. im guessing $1500-$2500? 
fedlawman,April 2008," ""what is comparable today? sooner or later, the old stands down to the creativity of tomorrow.mitsubishi evo? sti? is-f? rs-4?""unfortunately, theres nothing comparable. 3500# is what these car weigh today. the only current ""lightweight"" sports car with a backseat that i can think of is the mazda (and porsche 911).thats why i keep my e30. its basically a honda s2000 with a hardtop and backseat. "
sls002,April 2008," i guess i dont see how adding a mere two cylinders transforms an out of balance engine into one that perfectly balanced. while i agree that a 4 cylinder engine probably has more nvh (noise, vibration & harshness) than a 6, an 8 (either a v-type or straight 8 like my grandmothers 50 buick) should be still better, with a v12 or v16 at the optimum.an inline 6 is better than a 60 degree v6. "
circlew,April 2008," perhaps they will create a .5 series...regards,ow "
shipo,April 2008," well, whether you ""see"" it or not, its the truth. fact, i-6, h-6, v-12, and h-12 engines are naturally in balance for all free forces of both the first and second order, and free moments of the first and second order, and to the best of my knowledge are the only commonly built ptoyotaon engines that are naturally in balance, and as such, naturally smooth.a discussion of the whys and hows of this balance issue is complex and long winded, and is way too over the top for the purposes of this forum. if you dont believe it, buy yourself a bosch automotive handbook (i have one and it is a phenomenal wealth of information), or you can look at any number of web sites that discuss such things. here are a few:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/engine_balancehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straight_enginehttp://www.vibratesoftware.com/html_help/html/diagnosis/engine_speed_related.htm- - best regards,shipo "
nyccarguy,April 2008," i actually first walked away from the car last sunday after initially looking at it because it was an automatic. a few voices in my head (roadburner & fedlawman) told me i was crazy. im actually going to learn to perform the maintenience on the car myself. once i get it running well, then ill swap out the slushbox for a 5-speed.  "
fedlawman,April 2008," what, its an automatic?!?!i missed that part of your original message. never mind, you shouldnt have bought it. :p "
sls002,April 2008," i looked over your references, and while wikipedia is a good source it is not always entirely correct. they commented that straight eight engines did not have ohv which is not correct as the buick straight eight had ohv beginning in the 1930s. i see your point about the straight six, but i still think that a nicely balanced v8 may be smoother running. most sixes are v6 designs and are not as good. "
alltorque,April 2008," it was drummed into me many years ago that the ""smoothest"", i.e. best naturally-balanced engines are 6s and 12s. 4s and 8s will always be less well naturally-balanced. no, cant explain why now but no doubt some of the pro engineers will be able to. not sure about v6s as we didnt have many of those back in my day but we did have quite a few nice straight-6s; and they were very smooth if not terribly powerful by todays standards. "
sls002,April 2008," if you look at shipos references and follow on with some of the other references you will find that the v6 needs counter balancing to run smoothly. with counter balancing the v8 is very smooth running. i think shipos point was that the inline six without counter balancing is smooth running, while other engines require some sort of balancing.as i see it, the size of an inline six for any particular vehicle will be limited by how much space is given to the hood length. for the same hood length, a v-engine will take up less space and can therefore be larger than the inline six, for up to 12 cylinders. "
fphjr01,April 2008," i liked the comment about how ""an increase in boost pressure should bring the hp from 300 to 355"". this is interesting, considering that many of the available reviews on the 335s performance have indicated that the book 300hp claim is very likely low-balling the actual output.what a perfect idea -- make a 335 tii version, claim that there is 55 more hp than the standard engine (when its actually exactly the same), and charge $5000 more for the modification. "
plekto,April 2008," inline engines also have much less mechanical complexity. v engines are a design nightmare - angles and extra connecting rods and multiple camshafts and...that adds weight as well. and worsens efficiency. so as a result, you can make a smaller i-6 than a v6 and get the same results. so often, you can fit the i-6 in the car as well as a v6. but gm and ford never really designed i-6 engines - at least not recently. so they trudge along with their overly complex v engines. bmw and mercedes started out with inline engines and still use a lot of them.as for the weight, 3400lbs is just about what my 87 buick park ave weighed. thats hideously bloated for such a small car. it should be closer to 2600lbs. "
blueguydotcom,April 2008, you can get that with a dinan mod for 2k. 
sjaieve,April 2008," might as well make room for this car in this segment. i havent seen what else it has to offer but it will slaughter a lot of the pseudo ellps. 295 pound feet of torque, pretty impressive. "
blueguydotcom,April 2008," edmunds saab turbo x write-up:http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/drives/firstdrives/articleid=124967yes, its a fwd-bias halsubaru system - ie garbage. 3800 lbs.and that acuraary saab performance. oh right, its a saab... "
sjaieve,April 2008," gosh, you are merciless. i will read the article and see what edmunds says. i think its a fair attempt by saab though "
sls002,April 2008," gm does have on ohc truck i6 that was used on the mid-size suvs. so gm has an inline six that is a recent design, but it was not design for car. i think that the torque and power output of an engine is related to the size of the engine and an inline engine does not have more torque just because it is an inline.the 87 buick was bigger than the current bmw which is just a heavy. "
circlew,April 2008," i disagree...even compared to the cts, this car is low grade and should not be in ellps category, imho.regards,ow "
sjaieve,April 2008, i will respecfully widthdraw this candidate  
mz6greyghost,April 2008," why?just because two ""contributors"" dont like the car, it doesnt mean that we should not talk about the saab here.afaic, the saab is considered a competitor in this category, and so does just about every other automotive source thats out there. they may not like it, but its out there, offering similar performance and items/features, for a similar price. "
sjaieve,April 2008," it starts at 42k, there are only sending 600 to the us, is only available in black. if it were a mass car like everything else in ellps i would have happily proceeded with the argument but i cant just do that for the sake of it.i like the way you think though  "
fedlawman,April 2008, woot! the bimmerphiles win again :p 
r34,April 2008," actually saab is not big. it may not have the good handling as the bimmers and it may not have good interior as the audi. however, it is a nice overall package. it gives you a taste of european car with an honda price (after all incentives). it belongs to highway. the turbo is amazing. you can feel safe driving it with triple digits (like most european car). you can drive some car in triple digits but you will not feel safe because they were not built for autobahnn speed.i dont trust certain car reviews. people need to test drive the car. "
alltorque,April 2008," inline engines also have much less mechanical complexity. v engines are a design nightmare - angles and extra connecting rods and multiple camshafts and... that adds weight as well. and worsens efficiency. so as a result, you can make a smaller i-6 than a v6 and get the same results. so often, you can fit the i-6 in the car as well as a v6. forgive me for being pedantic but why would a v6 need more connecting rods than an i6 ? also, dont forget that you make make a shorter, (in length and lose a little height), engine in v6 than of the same bore i6.............can see some benefits there. of course flat 6s are even better, albeit rather rare. subaru and porsche being the only ones that come to mind in current production.no particular preference for v or i - just like 6s in general and 5 cylinder diesels in particular, (yes, i know, its my age  ). "
tayl0rd,April 2008, forgive me for being pedantic but why would a v6 need more connecting rods than an i6 ? ...it doesnt. six cylinders are six cylinders. he was just spitting out parts trying feverishly to prove an i6 is better than a v6 without even considering what those parts are or what they do.  
alltorque,April 2008," ah, so it wasnt just an old brit missing something, then. thats reassuring. my first car was a 1956 vauxhall velox - sort of u.k. take on an early-50s chevrolet something; all rounded and nice. that had a 2262cc i6 that pumped out a mind-blowing 59bhp, (but a fair bit of torque), and was coupled to a 3m box. first was so low that you could use it for pulling up tree stumps. even that amount of power could embarass the cross-ply tyres of the day. all black body, lots of chrome and a carnation pink & white interior, (2 x 3 seat benches), plus valve radio. you could definitely see the gm influence. happy days. :shades: "
louiswei,April 2008," i dont have any preference either, as long as a 6-banger gives me 300+ hp then i am good. i prefer na but ill take an almost-turbo-lag-less twin turbo 6 as well. "
sjaieve,April 2008," i prefer 300+ horses with a nice price tag and a respectable 0-60 & 1/4 mile. all i need to know about the engine copmonents is there are reliable, nothing more "
plekto,April 2008," i meant more parts in the connecting rods. i see it as having pultiple connecting rods since it has more than one part between the ptoyotaon and the crankshaft.*** from wiki on 60 degree engines***however, more modern designs often use a 3-throw crankshaft with what are termed flying arms between the crankpins, which not only give the required 120? separation but also can be used for balancing purposes. combined with a pair of heavy counterweights on the crankshaft ends, these can eliminate all but a modest secondary imbalance which can easily be damped out by the engine mounts***so you dont have ptoyotaon. rod. crankshaft. like in an inline engine. you have a bunch of intermediary parts kludged together to keep it from shaking itself apart.gms 90 degree designs are even more complex and run even rougher, being designed off of v8 engines. actually quite nasty, really. they tend to eat through engine mounts fairly regularly. the reason you dont see many i6s is because they usually wont fit in a fwd car due to there needing to be space for the cv joints and transmission as well. thankfully it is making a comeback as makers are slowly realizing what a giant turd fwd technology is, especially in vehicles with over 200hp. "
cdnpinhead,April 2008," "". . .plus valve radio.""i also remember tube (valve) radios in car -- they took awhile to warm up and really could run down the battery if left on while the engine (with its generator) was shut down. lots of things have improved tremendously in automobiles over the past 50 years, but many of them add weight.my 65 mgb was lots of fun to drive & own, with the knock-offs, wire wheels, the tightest steering ive ever had and shifter feel that was unequalled. safe? not really. powerful? no. radio quality? awful. still, a wonderful car. "
shipo,April 2008," ummm, im thinking that youve grossly misinterpreted what you quoted from wikipedia. true, most v6 engines use a three throw crank with some form of an offset between paired connecting rods to achieve an even 120 degree firing interval, however, even the 60 degree engines that use flying arms (an arm that reaches between connecting rods and extends from the throw back through the axis of the crank and some dtoyotaance beyond) have no more complicated connecting rod assemblies than an inline engine. fwiw, flying arms are cast into the crank itself, they dont move independently and other than a little machining to remove a small amount of metal in the balancing process, require no extra work during engine assembly.actually, when looked at from a part count perspective, v6 crank shaft, crank bearing, and connecting rod assemblies (bearings included) are actually simpler than an i6. why is that? simple, your typical v6 only uses four main bearings with a single 2-cylinder offset throw in between each main pair, however, your typical i6 uses seven main bearings with each cylinder having its own throw situated between main pairs. in spite of this difference, i6 engines usually have a considerably lower parts count compared to a v6 of an otherwise similar design.best regards,shipo "

bfluegie,April 2008," i&#146;m looking for a new (to me) ride. i don&#146;t have to decide just now, but probably sometime in the next couple of months. i thought i&#146;d post this here as well as on the &#147;help me decide&#148; forum because this seems to be a very active discussion. some of the car i am considering do fit this category, so it&#146;s not too much of a stretch. what i am considering is a (probably) pre-owned bmw 325xi (maybe a 330xi if the deal is right, but i&#146;m not too sure i want a turbo), pontiac5x (i have vpp so i might go new for this), audi audi or audi (i like the audi better but they&#146;re hard to find in the northern in vicinity), acura acura or maybe tl, but it&#146;s larger and i don&#146;t like it as much. i might consider the nissan coupe as well, but not the sedan. while i like the sedan styling more than the honda or toyota, i don&#146;t like it as much as the infinity, and the nissan sedan are everywhere. i don&#146;t want to put my car away for the winter, so i prefer all wheel or front wheel drive. that leaves out the infinity g-coupe (sigh) and the bmw 3 series coupe. i know several people who drive the g coupe and they either garage it for the winter or get adequate but not great driving with winter tires. i prefer the security of good winter handling. i haven&#146;t completely ruled out a small suv or crossover, but after 8 years of driving an exploder i&#146;m ready for a more responsive ride. i joke about the ford, but with the exception of an unfortunate &#147;bambi&#148; incident i have never been left stranded. no significant repairs other than normal wear and tear either. it just has over 130k miles and it is time to move on to something else. as long as i&#146;m moving on, i want to add some fun. i won&#146;t be racing or pushing for maximum speed, but i do like the feel of a car that you don&#146;t have to slow to a crawl when going around a curve. i suppose i want to feel like i am part of a driving system rather than the occupant of a vehicle. i would consider a 2006-2007, maybe a 2005 as well. i know the infinity was a new model in 2007 but i like the previous model as well. the bmw was a new model in 2006 and i don&#146;t know anything about the 2005. i might be overlooking something else as well, so any suggestions for additional car to consider (or avoid) are welcome. i&#146;m considering a manual in the bmw or audi but i didn&#146;t like the manual in the &#145;07 tl i drove (the clutch seemed to have a very tiny &#147;sweet spot&#148; and it didn&#146;t help that the salesperson sneered a little when i lurched on a start). i don&#146;t know if the acura would be any better. the pontiac5x is only available in an auto. manual vs. auto isn&#146;t a big factor for me so i probably wouldn&#146;t rule out an auto bmw or audi either. since i&#146;m going to continue getting older and creakier, the auto might be a smarter choice, just not as much fun in the pre-creaky years. "
ivan_99,April 2008," you have a wide range of requirements...but you didnt clarify the price range youre looking for or any requirement for seating/space.im also assuming youre looking at purchasing as opposed to leasingfor coupes...if you dont need back seat room very often a tt would be a nice ""cool"" coupe to have (2.0t fwd). a new honda coupe with the i4 5spd would be very economical but look a little different than everything else. im a big fan of the audi (s-line)...especially the s5 (love the torque...gets pricey)...audi with fwd and manual (s-line) starts in the low 40s. and of course the new bmw 1 series.4-doors...if you can wait the new audi looks very interesting...the base is250 can be had with manual and it starts our at a reasonable price...though not fwd (have yet to drive). i recently drove a cts (doesnt get much love) both high end and base (manual) and found them very compelling (but probably not for my $s)manual...if youre weighing the pros and cos of a manual versus automatic you can check out volkswagens dsg. last year i drove a volkswagen volkswagen fahrenheit and it was the most amazing fwd car ive driven (was 27k ish...)non-domestic? most of you choices seem to be ""non-domestic"" if you want fwd you can add volvo (s30, s40). saab 08, 9-3 turbo x looks aggressive. "
alltorque,April 2008," volvo c30 is cute but quite small and only 2 doors, (+hatch of course). s40 is nice and about bmw size. volvo is a tad bigger than the bmw, (but only a tad), and gets my vote - biased owner; albeit a diesel with geartronic. volvo is well worth a look.saabs are rated a bit so-so here in u.k. but are premium priced. audi good in whatever size. audi is about volvo size.cant comment on the others, apart from volkswagen, but the current ones are good. "
bfluegie,April 2008," thanks for the input ivan. while i have not ruled out domestic, i havent found the blend of performance, features, and solid feel in many domestic car. pricewise, im trying to stay in the mid 30s or lower. while i could afford more, thats where the toyota zone starts to end and the panic zone begins. the audi could get me to make an exception, though. seeing that beauty in my garage every morning could calm a lot of panic.i hadnt considered the volkswagen fahrenheit and i will have to check it out. i have driven the dsg, though in an audi audi. i really liked that car. i forgot the audi was heading for a redesign. ill have to check that out as well. the current cts looks sharp and i can get the supplier discount (below invoice) so i might look there as well. thank you for some very good suggestions. "
bfluegie,April 2008," thanks for the input. i forgot to add in my reply to ivan_99 that i might look at the volvos as well. i get the supplier discount on them as well so i could get a little more car there as well. i have always liked the looks of the saab 9-3 (especially the convertible) but the reliability issues i have read about have made me cautious. the edmunds review posted earlier in this forum makes it seem worth a look as well. im not sure about the pricing, but looking is fun.thanks again. "
r34,April 2008," saab is not much worse than audi and is probably better than volvo and volkswagen. as long as you take your car to a good dealer (usually a saab or european car only dealership) or a good indy, you should be fine. saab is more generous on warranty work too (what is covered).saab is more a drivers car than volvo, even a volvo salesman admitted that (i went to a saab/volvo/cad dealership to test drive a v6 9-3).they have a lot of incentives. if you get it at the right time, you can save several thousands (usually $3000-$5000. with this economy, there may be more).if you are buying a used european car, you may want to get a certified one. parts and services could be expensive after the warranty expired. "
plekto,April 2008," i dont know... the last time i was in a toyota dealership, the prices for used parts were approaching mercedes levels of insanity. and volvo was just as bad. "
bruceomega,April 2008," bfluegie,fyi, the bmw 3 series coupes are also available in awd.i dont know if youre open to a small, fun to drive suv, but you might want to look at the bmw x3. we went to the dealer with the idea of trading in my wifes 01 330xi for a new, at that time, 06 330xi, but she ended up getting the x3 and loves it. we find it a lot of fun to drive for a vehicle with its capabilities. i once had an ford as a loaner, and the x3 is a very different kind of vehicle. also, the x3 can be had with a manual.bruce "

markcincinnati,April 2008," why pay $5,300 more for a car that has a heavier front end, takes more gasoline to propel it and has 15 ft lbs less torque -- and that the torque it does have comes on at thousands of rpms higher?i had an allroad 2.7t and i had also had three audi car with the 4.2 v8 (one audi and two audi) -- so when it came time to order the allroad, i test drove another sort of similar car, an audi 2.7t. torque rules.and in the example above, the v8 had 295 ft pounds of torque vs the v6s 258 ft pounds, yet the v6 was quicker because the torque came on (in the v6) at below 2,000 rpms and the v8 didnt come up to full boil until north of 3500 rpms.in this case, the new 2.0tfsi has 258 ft pounds, below 2000 rpms and the 3.2fsi has 243 at north of 3200 rpms -- this is a no brainer.the v6 imho is for the consumer who wants to talk about the 265hp v6 (despite its lower torque.)had audi offered the engine competing with the bmw 335 i6 turbo, well, that might have been a horse(power) of a different color.i believe the audi 2.0t will be the car of choice for about 10-12 months in the audi family; the v6 being offered solely for marketing reasons (""wouldnt do,"" to have this car without a v6 in the brochure, kind of thing.)i may, but i doubt it, regret this decision. but the handling, mileage and performance of the 2.0tfsi should be superior in cincinnati oh (where it will see most of its duty.) it will easily top any speed limit we have in these parts (just as easily as the v6) and its quickness, for a while at least, will be unequaled -- at least until the supercharged v6 comes out in a year or so.another audi 3.2 certainly was an option -- but the new audi will have a 110+"" wheel base, the audi is 111+"" -- the balance, rwd biased audi, sport package and other amenities and luxuries in the premium plus package makes the audi 2.0tfsi a ""better"" choice for someone who wants cts style luxury (at least) and very bmw like performance and handling -- in a handsome package.rationalization?perhaps -- but there are just too many head to head (audi vs audi) test reports and reviews of this new audi to make me wonder ""who in their right mind would pay more for less?"" -- and that seems to make the case in favor of the audi (b8) 2.0t with ""all the option boxes ticked off -- except acc.""so, well see how much under $50k this comes out to be -- and hopefully i will not regret not going with my second choice: the new infiniti infiniti 4 door sedan.fwiw, my dealer says this car should be comparable in msrp to the outgoing model + about $2,000 for the audi drive select and a ""few hundred"" more for the addition of a backup camera.time will tell -- and i will share the good, the bad and the expensive with yall. :surprise: "
markcincinnati,April 2008," my wife recently took a job in the cbd of cincinnati -- seemed difficult for her ever get out of third gear -- just no fun with the stick (for her.)i virtually hated my automatic (5 speed tiptronic) transmissions in my previous audi -- love the automatic in my 2005 audi 3.2. i drive some 15+ miles to work most of it on i275/i71 in cincinnati. when i am in any ""fun place"" to drive the stick, the traffic is often all tangled up.with automatics this good -- i rarely miss the sticks.i did test drive a new s5 -- wheeeeeeeee -- now that was a blast. but truth be told, the same pain in the butt traffic issues would apply even with that one.i have officially joined the ranks of those who, while i did not kill the stick shift, certainly are preventing its resurection. to those of you who wont go shiftless, i apologize -- i am keenly aware of your pain (past tense.) i would have loved a 7speed dsg even more, im sure -- just not avail this time.also not this time, torque vectoring, which i would have paid extra for. :surprise: "

jaxs1,April 2008," if im open to look at a lot of different brands, which near luxury sedan have the hottest lease deals for a 15k per mile lease?im open to 2 or 3 year leases, but assume 3 year leases will have much lower payments, so i would more likely do a 45k 3 year mile lease than a 30k 2 year mile lease.im looking for the lowest combination of total costs (lease payments + maintenance and wear etc.). for instance i know bmw include free scheduled maintenance, but many car with ""sport"" packages and 18"" performance tires can cost thousands extra in 3 years due to tires that dont last long and are ultra expensive to replace.if i were to lease one of these vehicles, i would want automatic transmission, premium package with heated leather seat and moonroof, bluetooth. must not have low treadlife 18""+ sport performance tires. factory nav would be a plus if any would still fit the price range even with nav.can less than $450 before tax be done with $0 cap reduction on any of these car with that equipment based on realtoyotaically available discounts in california?bmw, pontiac5 sedan, c300 luxury, tl, acura, es350, are some that id like to consider.

jaxs1,May 2008," i thought i might need to buy a lexus for a quiet ride, but i found the 3 series to be surprisingly quiet. not ls460 dead silence, but seemed about as quiet as an es to me when i drove it regardless of what any db meters may say.i ended up buying a bmw.from inside with the windows closed, the turn signals are most noticeable noise at times:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taqpontiacjrzl_c&fmt=6 "
blueguydotcom,May 2008," yep, its a german buick. "
tayl0rd,May 2008," you mustve bought one without the sport package. i had a bmw loaner last week (non-sport), and i was also surprised at how quite the ride is. and yes, the turn signal is a little obnoxious. ive driven a bmw sport and it wasnt very quiet at all. id still buy one, though! amazing how much of a difference tires can make. "
blueguydotcom,May 2008," no, the sport package still feels like a buick. "
tayl0rd,May 2008," i dont know if id go that far. even the non-sport doesnt feel like a buick. that was my first extended time with a bmw and i put it through some paces. it handles really well, though it will understeer on you when you start pushing the limit. and the steerings not quite as quick as i like. the sport package is much better as far as handlings concerned. i havent driven a bmw sport long enough to really test the steering.heres a strange one for you. i test drove an bmw sedan and its suspension actually felt softer than my 550i sport! :surprise: (it didnt have the adjustable suspension.) go figure! but boy was it precise in direction. and getting back in my 550i after the bmw, i could really feel the heft of the bmw over the bmw. (or 550i sport over the bmw, that is.) "
plekto,May 2008, check out the weight of one. close to 2 tons. the reason its quiet is because they have added several hundred pounds of materials to dampen it like a buick or a mercedes.handling is nowhere as good as the 3 series a decade ago as a result of being 700lbs or so heavier. 
tayl0rd,May 2008," there arent ""several hundred pounds"" of sound dampening material. the vast majority of the weight comes from safety equipment, amenties, and chassis stiffening/bracing. "
sls002,May 2008," the increase in weight is due to the bodys larger size (#1) and stiffer structure (#2). the new 1-series is a return to a smaller body, but they are using the 3 series platform so it has the same weight problem. "
plekto,May 2008," ""stiffer structure"" means more metal and dampening materials. the safety equipment between 1998 and 2008 isnt actually that different. maybe 100lbs more, if that, since the older models came pretty much with everything that was available at the time. "
sls002,May 2008," dampening materials do not make the structure stiffer, but do reduce noise and vibrations. "
berad,June 2008," ""if you are between an audi and an is 250 and scratching your head then look at consumer reports.... only 53% of owners would buy the audi again - this is the bottom of the barrel. the is 250 rwd is 78% -- this is near the very top of the ltoyota. all in all the odds are that you will be happier with the is 250.""for what its worth...crs data has change - the is250 rwd & is350 have a csat of 78% the is250 awd is 72% and the audi is now 78% "
blueguydotcom,June 2008," depends on the buyer. if youre buying for luxury the is250 seems like the ticket (and that ticket is very expensive). if you want space for people, utility, power (its got gobs more than the is250) and still a small package, then the audi golden (and priced nicely). personally, i detested the is (even the 350) and find the audi allows us to do everything - pick up passengers, go on a run to home depot for larger items, smooth, effortless power. the handlings not as sharp as i would like and theres road noise from the cruddy all-season tires. gas mileage, when i drive it, tends to be in the mid to high 20s. outside of the rwd layout, which lexus numbed down to the point that the car understeers like a fwd, i cant personally see the value in the far more expensive, less powerful, less useful is250. "
jzalkin,June 2008," i owned an audi cab (sold at 56,00 miles) and now have the is250 (36,500 miles). here are my thoughts.quality is a lot better in the lexus. forget the big items as the small stuff makes for greater frustration. i always had a few things in the audi that needed to get addressed every service (broken small pieces, peeling of plastic coating, etc), but not with the lexus. the lexus is put together great. i know why they have loyalty because there are so few complaints on the small annoying things as the car ages. i guess that is why there are a lot of last gen lexus driving around that people love. service varies, but around south florida, the lexus experience is top shelf (better than audi). i almost never have a ltoyota of little things to be addressed at the service intervals.the audi feels sportier and has a roughness that reinforces that. the lexus is serene and the quietness/plushness reinforces that. both get old at times, but you have to decide your preference. i cant compare engines as my audi cab was heavy and did not perform any better than the is250. i get great gas mileage and do not want any more hp in my car given fuel prices. with prices expected to hit $4.50 by end of july (premium - see record oil prices today and stock market plunge) i wouldnt mind giving up even more hp for even better gas mileage. the audi is more nissantile, but cant touch the lexus for overall luxury. plus, the lexus v6 is smooth and does have plenty of umph when needed. i loved the audi and await the audi convertible, but unless you carry a lot of things that you need the audi for space - i think the lexus is the better choice. i was not inclined to keep the audi out of warranty, but will not hesitate to keep the lexus based on my personal experience. "
carnaught,June 2008," my experience varies with yours. my gs 400 lexus had to have two dashboards replaced because of butoyotaling up of the vinyl. i sold it when a third was required due to reccurrence. my lexus service rep. called the situation, ""bad product"". an isolated incident? maybe, but my 1995 ls400 and 2003 lexus sc 460 had the same problem. the other car ive owned including the audi had no such problem(s). "
blueguydotcom,June 2008, what year audi cab? the 2005/2006 came with a 1.8t and a cvt in a car weighing an astounding 3600 lbs while only offering 170 hp/166 hp. the 3.0 with 220 hp/220 ft-lbs jumps to 4000 lbs.comparing the audi cab to the is250 is sorta misleading and not representative of comparing an is250 to an audi.

yjbeach,June 2008," does anyone in here have a friend with an audi. they have serious electircal problem and people that say that it is fixed are wrong. i cant say how the rest of the usa is but in the md, dc, va area that problem still happens. my friend just purchased an audi avant and with less than 10k miles the ac has already been repaired 3 times. his dashboard is lit up like an xmas tree.my other friends with audi have had smiliar problem from years 03 until 07.go with the is. "
shipo,June 2008," one car, or even a couple of car does not an indictment of an entire company make. i know lots of folks with audi that havent had a single electrical problem. "
alltorque,June 2008," have three close friends with audi. an audi 3.0tdi, (with a gazillion toys fitted at the factory), an audi 2.0 tdi and an rs4 avant. first two are 2 and 3 years old respectively. the audi has 78k miles on it without any glitches, (hes trading it next jan for an audi tt tdi cos he heading for second childhood. the audi has around 60k miles and has only suffered one glitch - two weeks ago the audi satnav decided to stop working for 10 minutes whilst driving around the paris periphertoyotaue, (great place to lose satnav), but came back of its own honda. the rs4 is only 6 months old and no hiccups but same friend also has a ferrari f355 which seems to go wrong on just about every trip...............to the extent that hes gonna sell it as he thinks the rs4 is a far better-built car, damn near as fast, far more useable and it doesnt attract the wrong sort of attention from the boy-racers or constabulary, (we have a couple of subaru imprezza subaru police car locally which do send out a certain clint eatwood-esque message. ""ya feelin lucky, punk?"" or perhaps, ""make my day"". very entertaining though.other folk i know whove had audi swear by them - not at them. youve either got a :lemon: or folks who dont know what theyre doing with the diagnostics etc.on the other hand i have a neighbour with a newish mercedes mercedes and hes either having an affaire with the receptiontoyota at the local mercedes dealer or the car really is a dog. just to balance that a near neighbour has one of the old, squarish, m-b s500s...........the one that just needs a big gun on the roof to complete the main battle tank image, (its even painted dark green metallic), and with 200k miles up it just keeps going but does have a drinking problem which is starting to hurt with gasoline here, (uk), at the equiv of $9+ per us gallon. as with all things electro-mechanical there are great examples and not-so-good ones. isnt that part of the fun ? apologies for the long-winded response. blame old age. mine. "
sjaieve,June 2008," if its coming down to a choice btwn is250 & audi 2l turbo, i would also look at the acura. you may lose awd or rwd but its a pretty modern car which perfoms well and can be had at $32k fully loaded. i am not even into acura but the new acura has quite a bit to offer "
shipo,June 2008," ive driven all three, and in spite of the fact that i value rwd over any other drivetrain, id rank the car as follows:1 - audi audi 2.0t 6-speed -- by far the most enjoyable the three to drive, and has the most rear seat space and the most utility as well given the mini-station wagon configuration.2 - acura acura 6-speed -- fun to drive, lots of goodies (that i dont necessarily care about), and reasonable space in the back seat.3 - lexus is250 rwd 6-speed -- extremely boring to drive with no ""feel"" of whats going on with the mechanicals or down on the road. this car also suffers from an anemic engine (at least until you wind it up even higher than the acura already high strung mill) and a back seat that is all but laughable. in every respect, this car is a very dtoyotaant third of the three.best regards,shipo "
darrinzramz,June 2008," hi need some answers if possible,i have a pontiac5 sedan 2004,ive been using 87 octane in my car w/no problem at all.seems to me when gas gauge reads full,i watch the gas gauge over the course of the week,and i notice it stays up near-full for the 1st 85-100 miles i put on the car,then all of the sudden the gas gauge seems to go down quite quickly from there.im medium on the gas on occasion i will get on it medium to slightly hard,it seems im only getting 15.6mi/gal,does that seem a bit much or not!!!????.anyways ive change the plugs to a performance plug also i installed a k&n filter,there is no gas leaks what so ever!!!,any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,i also do use my cruise contol also,do mostly honda driving though, not alot of stop and go,thanks darrin lynch  "
shipo,June 2008," a few points:1) over the decades ive had dozens of car that were from asia, north america and europe, and every one of them has exhibited the same gas gauge charactertoyotaics as your car (i.e. the needle is fairly stable for say 100 miles following a fill-up, and then it drops like a rock). this is totally normal as the level of fuel when ""full"" is typically above the top measurement range of the gauge sensor.2) iirc, infiniti recommends ""premium"" gasoline for your 2004 pontiac5 engine (an engine well known for its poor fuel economy by the way), you should check your owners manual to be sure. assuming thats the case, by running regular you are forcing the engine management system to retard the ignition timing to keep the engine from blowing itself to bits because of the low grade fuel youre feeding it. in turn, retarded ignition timing will further reduce the already marginal fuel economy of your engine.3) given how modern engine management systems work, it is physically impossible for a k&n filter to improve fuel economy. in fact, there is a fair amount of empirical evidence that suggests this type of a filter can reduce your economy.4) based upon the reports of other owners of your car, 15.6 mpg is not too far out of line for ""mostly honda driving"".sorry i couldnt be more helpful. best regards,shipo "
ghstudio,June 2008," the nissan/infiniti engine is one of the really solid engines...its still the base for the current nissan/infiniti engines. it is not the most thrify on gas, neither is it the worst. it is possible that not using high test is effecting your mileage, but ive tried 93 octane and 87 octane in my 06 bmwand ive seen no difference in mpg or pep. a larger factor is ethanol in your gasoline (unavoidable today) which gives you less mpg then 100% gasoline. i doubt that octane is causing any problem in this engine however you can try three tanks of high test and see if you see any significant difference.fuel guage is what it is...i think it was the old bmw where they made the guage for the last 1/4 tank of gas almost 3/4 of the guage. its rare that it matters how full the tank is when it shows full...but it really does matter when youre down to 1/8 a tank.high performance plugs and ""high efficiency"" air cleaners do almost nothing in a modern engine. actually, most all additives also do nothing, in fact most car makers recommend against using any additives in the car. if you arent driving aggressively, then about the only thing you can do that will really improve mileage is to turn off the a/c. "
circlew,June 2008," i have the bmw 330xi and have religiously used premium gas as spec. i get constoyotaent 22 mpg tank to tank. why you would use low octane on a higher performance engine is foreign to me. my car weighs 3,700 lbs and still gets acceptable gas mileage on standard a/s tires because each month i regulate tire pressure and rotate the tires each 5k miles.tires last longer, wear even and get the best efficiency as a result.it doesnt take much to get the specified mpg rating for your car if you are aware of the small details.regards,ow "
1nickatnite1,June 2008," i dont know about 04 pontiac5s but with the current ones you cannot rotate the tires. 15.6 mpg does sound low but if it is mostly honda driving and since you admit to driving with a ""medium to heavy"" foot it is not that surprising. best gadget ive heard of for saving gas is the fuel ""mizer?""

markcincinnati,June 2008," i read the post you replied to -- and i thought the number of posts pertaining to ""false economy"" would have somehow not been missed by this owner. i figured he must actually want to get poorer mileage and poorer performance.the inside of the filler door, the manual, the dealer techs, the salespeople, this board and a few other places have repeatedly explained about the compensation for lower grade fuel that these engines make -- and, of course, the way that it is handled is as you say shipo.i leave for a few months and then come back for a look see and were still talking about the same stuff. i find the search facility works just fine -- why would the car require premium fuel, tell you it requires premium fuel and then surprise you when it runs at less than its most efficient?wonder if there is a ""glossary"" somewhere here that would be like an faq page for folks -- sort of like:fuel requirements regular, midgrade & premiumoversteerundersteerhorsepower vs torque: what we buy versus what we say we buydrive bias: front, rear, neutral, allnaturally aspirated, super charged, turbo charged, twin chargedand so on. . .""hey doc, it hurts when i do this. . .""doc: ""well then, dont do that. . .""

markcincinnati,June 2008," my 2009 audi has a build date of week 27. when it arrives several weeks later, it will be my 28th (or 27th or 29th) audi. i have never had an electrical problem -- other than a power window motor some time ago. i have never had an engine problem, never a transmission problem (other than the crappy tip-lag issue in the 5 speed auto -- and that was a software issue not a defect or hardware problem.)i may have had a headlight or tail light burn out last buick. i also had brake rotor warping issues in my 2001 audi.my experience with over 2 dozen audi is, stattoyotaically, probably not significant, but as an anecdote, it bears writing here perhaps to balance the ""audi still has problem. . ."" overall, i have no evidence that audi still has problem. my 05 audi, soon to be gone, will be missed. in so many ways it is still ahead, by years, of the newest cts -- if you could test drive these two car back to back, the content and performance of the c6/audi vs the cts demonstrates this point. the amount of trouble with dozens of audi has not been zero. it just has never been electrical as your post suggests.another corner heard from.

Kirstie_H,February 2009," a retoyotar is looking to talk with consumers who have considered purchasing a luxury car in the past, but would not do so currently because of the economy, or consumers who have traded-in their luxury vehicle. please send your email address and phone number to [email?protected] by friday, february 6, 2008. "
dash5,July 2009," was hoping to get some advice on my search. looking to spend no more than 22k on a used entry level luxury sedan. no more than say 40-50k miles. this would be my commute to work car, other car is a honda honda for family duty but this needs to be able to handle a car seat as a ""plan b"". my personal priority ltoyota would look something like:1. quiet smooth ride. dampen road noise.2. luxury cabin and modern amenities. i.e. soft leather, no cheap materials and someplace to plug my ipod in.3. power and performance. doesnt have to smoke everyone on the road or corner on rails but when i need to pass it should respond impressively.4. back seat capable of fitting a car seat and an adult if needed.5. drivable in bad weather. i wont say absolutely no rear wheel drive but i have previously owned an infiniti g-35 coupe and it was nearly useless in even a light snowfall and not good in the rain.6. sporty style. this is subjective obviously so. i am thinking:2006 bmw 325xi or a 2006 acura tlother candidates are the audi audi/audi, volvo volvo or mercedes c class.any input would be welcome including options like leasing or any tips on how to get the most for my money. "
alltorque,July 2009," the bmw would certainly do your jobs but the bmw is hardly ""luxury"". audi is cdodgeped in the back and the c class can be very vhondable on built quality/reliability. no idea about the acura, we simply dont see them in europe.audi or volvo would be my choice..............but i have to declare a bias as an volvo owner, (and a diesel at that). best seat in the business, nice lines, very well built and typically excellent swedish safety, (incl child seat). between the volvo and an audi would be a hard choice for me but the slightly more dtoyotainctive lines of the volvo would probably win me over - again - after 2 years of enjoyable, toyotaable, utterly reliable driving. $22k would buy you an 07 or possibly 08 volvo se lux here in u.k. and enough change for a good weekend away...........ditto for an volvo which is even nicer.ah, but the ipod plug-in would be an after-market fit; but hardly a deal breaker. "
pv2,July 2009," someone i know told me last week she picked up a 2006 acura tl with only 12k miles on it for $22k. nice deal and nice car. i had a 2003 cls and now have a 2007 tls. my tl has an ipod input jack in the center console, not sure if an older model would. both my tl and cl were fine in light to moderate snow as opposed to the 2 bmw 328cis i had. they needed separate winter tires to get through northeast winters. good luck! "
dash5,July 2009," thanks for the tips. i think my short ltoyota will be the bmw, tl and volvo. i suppose i could always get snow tires like you mentioned for a rwd car. hmm. the bmw seems to fit the bill in terms of fun to drive and status. light on luxury and amenities, heavy on price tag and a lot of people have one.the tl sounds like it has a lot of features and luxury, but im not sold on the style. although i have to see one in person to say for sure. red with tan interior sounds nice. we will see.the volvo is the dark horse. good value, safe, dtoyotainctive, reliable and more affordable. again though im not sold on the look or performance reviews i read. perhaps again if i see one in person in a color and trim i like and test drive it, that will come out ahead.and now im seeing the acura is considered luxury as well. another for my short ltoyota? "
carnaught,July 2009," the bmw seems to fit the bill in terms of fun to drive and status. light on luxury and amenities, heavy on price tag and a lot of people have one. pretty much, called right on.the tl sounds like it has a lot of features and luxury, but im not sold on the style. although i have to see one in person to say for sure. red with tan interior sounds nice. we will see.nice car, but weird looking, kind of a knight in armor without the knight.the volvo is the dark horse. good value, safe, dtoyotainctive, reliable and more affordable. again though im not sold on the look or performance reviews i read. perhaps again if i see one in person in a color and trim i like and test drive it, that will come out ahead. a nice looking and safe car but somewhat underpowered with fair interiors and gas mileage.imho "
bobhoops,July 2009," i bought a 06 tl in late october for $21k with 23k miles. it is everything you want except having an ipod jack. i would recommend it as your commuter car as it will be very reliable, it has very good power, and i think it looks great and a great back seat. "
dash5,July 2009," thanks bobhoops thats a good endorsement, appreciated. can you tell me if its a quiet smooth ride on the highway? really sounds like a contender for me.well i saw a white, late model tl in the parking lot today. i am guessing it was at least an 06 but possibly as new as a 09. sharp car, not what i would call dtoyotainctive or a head turner, but very nice. really though none of the car i am looking at are ""head turners"". tl makes my short ltoyota. bmw does as well. volvo i will be checking the volvos and volvos. audi i am eliminating because of reliability concerns, which may or may not be justified but ive just heard it too much and i need to eliminate something. too bad too because the audi is a sharp car. mercedes i am eliminating for now, that will be my gift to myself as a next car perhaps in 5-7 years when i can go beyond the c class. lexus doesnt seem to have anything i like within my price range. cadillac... not feeling it. only other car ill likely check out is the acura, not sure what the dtoyotainction is between that and the tl but it seems to get very good reviews.

fobulous,July 2009, i checked on cr and noticed that 2005 is the year that 325i has the highest rating.. why is that? im looking to get a 2005 or 2006 325i.. what are your experiences in these vehicles? my wife is currently driving the 2005 bmw x5 3.0 and we love it! it is also true that the best way to buy the used 325i is through a dealer that offers these as cpo?thanks all!! 
markcincinnati,July 2009," if you can get your choice of one of the car on your ltoyota with the cpo designation -- from the factory -- i would urge you to consider doing so, as the car on your ltoyota are breathtakingly expensive to repair without some kind of a warranty progdodge.i traded in my 2005 audi audi (fully loaded and with the v6) and it had 60k virtually trouble free miles on it. having toyota that, i would only acquire one (of any of these mfgrs kids) with the cpo designation.ps dont think you will use snow tires on an rwd car and enjoy it as much as an awd car with all seasons, in most places, that is. "
bastuk,January 2010," i posted a similar post in the luxury performance forum but this is probably more fitting. and its related to the recent posts by ""dash5"" on entry level luxury car. ive been driving a 01 honda ex-v6 for the past 8 years - its been a great car - the only things i have done are the std maintenance items - brakes, tires, etc. i am starting to shop for ""newer"" used car with less miles as i have 151k miles on it. i am looking at moving up into a more luxury class - looking at audi audi/audi, bmw 3 or 5 class or acura tl. today, i had a chance to drive all of these and in addition a mb. the dealer had a 04 mercedes e320 and it was awesome to drive and seemed priced ok ($17k).as i have been doing research i continue to find the biggest complaints against the german car being reliability and the high cost of repairs. honestly, after reading the articles and reviews, i am reconsidering ""moving up"" and thinking about buying a newer honda or just moving into the acura class.a couple of questions -+ are the repair costs significantly higher with a german car vs japanese? i have no baseline on my honda since i have not had to do any repairs.+ is the reliability that much worse for the german car than an acura/honda? "
carnaught,January 2010," a couple of questions - + are the repair costs significantly higher with a german car vs japanese? i have no baseline on my honda since i have not had to do any repairs. + is the reliability that much worse for the german car than an acura/honda? yes, yes.i would not own a used german-made car without an extended warranty. "
roadburner,January 2010," a couple of questions -+ are the repair costs significantly higher with a german car vs japanese? i have no baseline on my honda since i have not had to do any repairs.+ is the reliability that much worse for the german car than an acura/honda? over the past 27 years i have owned nine bmw. in my experience a 3 series wont be all that expensive to run, assuming that you have a good dealer or independent bmw tech to rely on. here are the current running costs on my four car that are used on a regular basis:2007 mazdapeed 3- 4.4 cents per mile over 52,000 miles2004 bmw x3 2.5- 2.8 cents per mile over 86,000 miles1999 jeep wrangler tj- 5.2 cents per mile over 58800 miles1995 bmw 318ti- 5.4 cents per mile over 120,000 milesin 86,000 miles the x3 has needed one warranty repair- a passenger srs sensor. aside from that it has needed one set of brakes at 60,000 miles and tires at 46,000. the inspection ii(major) service and a brake fluid flush at 65,000 miles cost less than $370.the 318ti is my part-time track rat(note that its running costs include four sets of track rutoyotaer). in the 15 years ive owned it its needed two sets of front pads and one set of rear pads along with four rotors. ive also replaced the drive belts and idler pulleys, the brake light switch, battery and the thermostat, all of which costs less than $550. my last inspection ii cost $495, and that number included a coolant flush and a four wheel alignment. in contrast, my mazda has needed major mechanical and suspension repairs- it will soon be replaced with either an bmw or bmw. "
plekto,January 2010," the problem stems from the suppliers for electronics in europe that german companies use. with their insane taxes, they are pretty much forced to use bosch and a few other makers for their switches and electrical components in the vehicle to keep costs down(porsche doesnt but they also charge the difference and then some).conversely, most of the better stuff in the world comes from korea and japan, so the components that cause the repairs dont fall fail half as often. the trick, of course, is to get a japanese or korean made vehicle that isnt full of chinese and malaysian and wherever else labor is cheap electrical and mechanical parts. "
bastuk,January 2010," how do the normal maintenance costs stack up for german car (oil changes, tires, etc)? i know bmw requires synthetic oil changes - not sure if audi or m-b does either. "
plekto,February 2010," much, much higher as they tend to use european filters and so on that arent usually interchangeable for the first few years until the equivalent replacements start to come out.then theres idiocy like the new mercedes that doesnt even have a dipstick. better hope the computers catch that leak before it goes bad.... :sick: and the shame about it is that while the car are horrendously pricey to fix and maintain, and the electronics and accessories are crap, the engine and drivetrain in them are some of the best examples of engineering on the planet.for instance, the mercedes engines are fantastic. but the rest of the car isnt put together any better than a chevrolet(and for 2-3x the price, it had better be a lot better in those areas) dont even get me started on the pleather/mb tex nonsense... even ford has better ""leather"" seat than that stuff. "
roadburner,February 2010," much, much higher as they tend to use european filters and so on that arent usually interchangeable for the first few years until the equivalent replacements start to come out. the oem oil filter for a 2010 honda v6 costs $7.00the oem oil filter for a 2010 bmw costs $10.00the oem air filter element for a 2010 honda v6 costs $26.13the oem air filter element for a 2010 bmw costs $22.95 "
plekto,February 2010," i didnt mention toyota because the truth is that while nobody was noticing, theyve raised their prices to higher than almost all of the rest for parts. the car dont break as often, but i can guarantee that anything oem from toyota costs twice as much as most of the other makes - and in many cases, more than mercedes or bmw.brakes and struts and other ""consumables"" are also high for toyota as well.note - the cheapest car to maintain and fix parts-wise tend to be nissan/infiniti and certain gm models(mostly their heavy duty trucks and isuzu models). note - real shame isuzu doesnt make passenger car any more. http://www.isuzu.co.jp/world/product/dmax/insubaru.htmlyoull note, though, that most of the suvs and trucks are re-badged and sold in the u.s. under the chevrolet badge. (the one above is called the chevrolet chevrolet in the u.s, of course) "
billyperks2,February 2010," ""note - the cheapest car to maintain and fix parts-wise tend to be nissan/infiniti and certain gm models(mostly their heavy duty trucks and isuzu models).""this is not true, nissan/infiniti is the most expensive to repair out of the asian brands.toyota is the cheapest, my mechanic speacializes in japanese car and he tells me this all the time.he even shows me the invoices for the parts he orders and warns me never to go with infiniti/nissan.

kdshapiro,February 2010," i dont. ive owned toyota and they have been dirt cheap to operate. you my friend are being ripped off.as far as reliability i dont know anyone complaining about the lack thereof, except here.me i put a 1000 miles on a rented toyota se recently and i loved it. im thinking of buying one. if there is one company that will make good on issues, its toyota, the other is honda. "
bob550k,February 2010," my mtoyotaake for dropping in here, the thread is ""entry level luxury performance sedan"". reads more like ""my econobox is cheaper to operate than your econobox"". "
plekto,February 2010," true. and of the car that fit the threads description, infiniti is currently the least expensive to maintain. itd have added lexus as nearly tied as well, but their recent problem and solutions are less than inspiring. and thats not counting the recent toyota/lexus transmission issues. theres a reason they dropped down the ltoyota in the last couple of years. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," you must be talking a different infiniti and a different lexus company. lexus are comparable in price to bmw, while infiniti are no better. at least bmw cost $0 for the first four years. all you have to do is look through car threads to see that these upscale brands, including acura charge an arm and leg.i owned a lexus for a brief while, $275 for an oil change...i think not. my infiniti owning friends go to jiffy lube. if you mean the car are cheaper if you take them to jiffy lube, i can buy into that, else its a load of bunk. "
gooddeal2,February 2010," i owned a lexus for a brief while, $275 for an oil change...i think not. my infiniti owning friends go to jiffy lube. if you mean the car are cheaper if you take them to jiffy lube, i can buy into that, else its a load of bunk.1. i bet lexus uses the synthetic oil for that $275. so, you only need to go there once a year instead of 3-4 times a year.2. the infiniti dealers in philly only charge ~$40 for an oil change w/ hand wash. however, they usually have the oil change coupons for about $25-30. "
qbrozen,February 2010," i owned a lexus for a brief while, $275 for an oil changei dont buy that for a second. no way was it just ""an oil change."" "
kdshapiro,February 2010," i stand corrected, oil change and a lube, check the fluids, tires, battery, etc. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," nobody is talking about the price of an oil change and ongoing recommended maintenance. to me $40 is still expensive, my oil changes are $17 on my other car. one can bring their car to a third party mechanic for major work.we are talking what happens after warranty when the tranny fails, water pump fails, alternator fails, o2 sensor fails, fuel pump fails, engine blows up. how much does an infiniti alternator cost, vs a bmw, vs a lexus?the first three years, 4 for bmw, are covered by b2b you can take the car to the dealer for warranty work and jiffy lube for oil changes. you can spend as much, or as little as you want on service. there are people who are dyi and people who bring it to the dealer.its when the warranty expires what are the price of the parts and labor, and to even the playing field id suggest using dealer rates, not third party mechanics. "
jimbres,February 2010,"  at least bmw cost $0 for the first four years.well, no. the cost of the ""free"" maintenance is baked into the purchase price of the car. you pay for it up front. i owned a lexus for a brief while, $275 for an oil changewhy would you go to the dealer for routine service? my wife has been driving lexus since the late 90s & is on her 2nd car. our excellent independent mechanic, who takes care of all non-warranty work on our car (we also have a bmw), charges $25 for an oil change.again, why would anyone go to a new car dealer for a plain vanilla oil change? "
kdshapiro,February 2010," well, no. the cost of the ""free"" maintenance is baked into the purchase price of the car. you pay for it up front.well yes, i bought a car, paid a price and now i pay $0 for the next four years.why would you go to the dealer for routine service? my wife has been driving lexus since the late 90s & is on her 2nd car. our excellent independent mechanic, who takes care of all non-warranty work on our car (we also have a bmw), charges $25 for an oil change. again, why would anyone go to a new car dealer for a plain vanilla oil change?that is exactly *part* of the point. the rest of the point is how expensive are these vehicles when the warranty expires. there are those who believe infiniti are cheap to own. i assert all of the vehicles are cheap to own for the first three years. but to calculate the costs, one has to assume, either all third party maintenance or all dealer maintenance...except for bmw.my assertion is after the b2b an infiniti water pump costs as much to install as a lexus water pump as a bmw water pump...or at least close enough for government work. "
jimbres,February 2010,"  my assertion is after the b2b an infiniti water pump costs as much to install as a lexus water pump as a bmw water pump...or at least close enough for government work. agreed. this has been my experience with my bmw, which has been out of warranty since the middle of 2005. here again, our independent mechanic provides the labor, & his rates are obviously the same whether hes working on the bmw or the lexus.i think that people who say that japanese luxury car are cheaper to maintain than their german counterparts have something else in mind -- namely, that the german car is likely to require expensive repairs sooner (earlier in the car life) & possibly more often than the japanese car. so while it may be true that the cost of replacing part x is pretty much the same for a bmw as it is for an infiniti, this part typically lasts for 125k miles on the infiniti but usually fails at the 90k mark on bmw. "
plekto,February 2010," true. and the electronics are more pricey on the bmw, audi, and mercedes as well, which are usually what goes bad first. for some reason, the german electronics firms just make second-rate junk, but they dont change to more reliable asian suppliers. actually i suspect the real reason is politics and taxes.i do know that when i owned a mercedes a few years ago(and a couple of volvos back before ford ruined them), they cost significantly more for the parts and often there was no aftermarket replacement for switches, accessories, and computer modules. i think what finally did it for me was when it cost me nearly $30 for a factory shift knob replacement for my volvo. (dont get me started on stuff like keys)the raw data suggests the following arrangement::1:infiniti2:lexus(toyota is now almost as expensive for parts as volvo, unfortunately. their transmissions are a known hugely expensive problem as well)3:4:cadillac/acura (they tend to switch back and forth - acura breaks less often, cadillac costs less to fix - nearly a tie as a result)5:6:7:8:(all the rest start here)theres a tiny gap between lexus and infiniti, then a small one to cadillac(major improvement in the last decade) and acura, and then a large drop down to the rest. i think what does it is that its really nissan, toyota, and honda versus the rest. in japan, there is only one product line - and the premium models are just that - the upper end models of the normal line.

kdshapiro,February 2010," can you back up your ""raw"" data other than the website you mentioned. the internet is great, anyone can say anything and have it be a fact. i certainly, and this is me, would not get an infiniti thinking it would be cheap to own after the warranty expires. but neither a lexus or bmw either. how about true cost to own on edmunds, what do they say? frankly im not looking it up, because your assertions dont pass the wet finger in the air test.edit: i checked tco. try it..it contradicts your assertions and is line with some common sense. bmw 328x, lexus 350, infiniti are all within a few bucks of one another. bmw bmw is $10 grand more...of course the 335 leaves the others in the dust in both performance and tco. toyota 4c more than $20 grand less. "
tlong,February 2010," i assert all of the vehicles are cheap to own for the first three years. actually, no. the depreciation costs in the first 3 years dwarf the maintenance costs in the out years. you just dont see those costs until you sell. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," owning a car for 3 years and then selling it, might as well lease. one has to assume if looking at these costs one drives the car until the wheels fall off or at least 5 years. "
tlong,February 2010," but still, depreciation is the biggest cost, dwarfing any maintenance costs. in fact, pretty much if you can afford to have a newer ellps you shouldnt be worrying about maintenance costs at all, as your big hit is acquiring the vehicle in the first place. the only difference is that the cost is either all up front, or fixed monthly-- whereas maintenance is sporadic and could be large. "

"
jimbres,February 2010,"  its no secret i love bmw, but if i get the car i love, its nice to have $0 maintenance for four years. in todays economy even the super-rich worry about their dollars.i love bmw too - i own one - but i dont think that bmw ""ultimate service"" (their name) progdodge will influence my decision when the time comes to replace my car (probably next year).it might be a tie-breaker for me if i had to choose between a bmw bmw & a comparably priced car from audi or mercedes. but i dont particularly like mercedes & having owned one audi, which was nothing short of horrific, ill probably never buy another.its much more likely that the final decision will come down to a bmw bmw versus an infiniti g. and the price gap between the 2 car is so great that the amount of money that ""ultimate service"" would save me - $649.40 over 4 years hondaing to bmw web site - is just laughably trivial.that doesnt mean that i might not buy another bmw, but it does mean that ""ultimate service"" wont be a factor in my thinking. "
tlong,February 2010," one only worries about depreciation if one is going to sell almost immediately. it is not a financially good decision to buy a car with selling it in three years in the back of your mind. if you are going to do that leasing is available. this is a silly argument we are having. even if you drive a car for 10 years, if it cost $45k new and $5k in 10 years = $40k = $4k/year in depreciation.if you buy a new toyota for $30k and it costs $3k in 10 years = $27k = $2.7k/year.so the ellps is $1.3k/year more expensive due to depreciation. which is why im saying that maintenance should not be a big factor. you would have to average $1300/year more in maintenance costs on the toyota per year to equal the much larger cost of the ellps purchase. so the ellps is a lot more expensive to own. and that is why even a grand or two every few years in maintenance costs is not that big. it has nothing to do with how long you keep the vehicle. maintenance is not a large part of the ownership costs. and i havent even brought up the costs for insurance, etc.so if you like an ellps and you can afford it, buy or lease it and dont worry about the maintenance costs, or perhaps you cant afford the vehicle in the first place. if you want a real worry, then the relative risk of breaking down or of time in the shop is probably more important, since that is a convenience issue rather than a cost issue. "
plekto,February 2010," tco has a huge problem with it.1: depreciation isnt a factor in comparing cost to fix/repair/upkeep a vehicle. also, neither is stuff like insurance. yes, it matters, but not to compare which vehicles are the least expensive to keep running(you really only lose money when you sell the car, if you ever do - or to be more accurate, you only get back the difference in depreciation when/if you sell it)2: the first years where the factory warranty is in place artificially skew the results. bmw comes out well by this measure because it does cost you nothing to keep the car running, or nearly so. but try that with a 5 year old bmw...tco is pretty worthless, really.just looking at the data i posted - if you go back to 2005, youll see lexus is taking about half of the spots. infiniti and cadillac vastly improved their quality since then and lexus slipped a bit down to where honda/acura is.(still very good, especially if you get a car with manual)link titlethe problem is that costs to fix things is skyrocketing. a replacement transmission in a toyota, for instance, runs over $3500 now. thats just silly. bumpers and other components that get scuffed or cracked are hideously expensive. want to replace a toyota or bmw or well, almost any car headlight assembly? so if one company can come in with less frequency and/or less cost per part than the competition, it wins. mercedes, audi, and bmw flat-out fail here. volvo is also notoriously pricey to fix. acura and infiniti are a bit better, as is cadillac(they take grief about not using the best newest tech, but then again, thats less stuff to break as well) toyota just has problem recently and id not recommend anything with an automatic or etc(electronic throttle control) on it from them.(thats 80%+ of their line currently. "
ivan_99,February 2010," want to replace a toyota or bmw or well, almost any car headlight assembly? gives me a flash back to last year when i wrote off my q45 (wasnt that bad of an accident). one headlight assembly came in over $1200...ouch "
kdshapiro,February 2010," theres that chevroletion again, lies, damn lies and stattoyotaics. you get to pick your metric and make your case based on your metric. there is no getting around it, the more expensive the car the more it costs to own.for example: in my area a rebuilt pontiac5 tranny is almost $2k, but a rebuilt toyota tranny is $700. not sure where you get your figures from. a headlight assembly for a infiniti is nearly $800. ouch.if you are saying an infiniti tranny breaks less often than a toyota tranny after the warranty period, you would have to point to some credible source for me to believe it. not just a cr survey.but it still boils down to will *your* car have an issue, and if it does what will it take to repair it. my bmw can be cheaper to own on a parts basis against a used honda if nothing breaks on it and the honda is constantly under repair. "
plekto,February 2010," i suppose if the rebuilt toyota transmission is a generation or two old and has no warranty and is out of some shop in the middle of the industrial section of town, you might find one for $700. but here in los angeles, a 4-5 year old toyota automatic is well over $3000 by the time you write the final check. the best i could find locally was $2100 with a warranty, not counting labor, shipping, tax(etc) and a core charge. the cts transmission was only $1600. now $500 might not be a huge amount to some people, but thats more than i spent last year on maintainance on my 4x4.with that sort of potential repair and the issues that keep coming up(plus the new toyota recall, now!) i cant recommend toyota other than for their trucks. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," who buys a new transmission? almost nobody? it must be a regional thing. the numbers i cited were local. it must be a supply and demand issue in the la area, which is a very narrow slice of information to make a broad generalization on.the other potential reason for the difference is that cts trannies may be crap, you get what you pay for.i have no problem with toyota, i would buy any of their car in a heartbeat, recalls or not, doesnt bother me in the least. i really like the toyota se and am mulling over buying it. "
1bythesea,February 2010," ""... toyota just has problem recently and id not recommend anything with an automatic or etc(electronic throttle control) on it from them.(thats 80%+ of their line currently. ""couldnt agree more. throw in transmission hesitation. i had a hesitating 2005 v6 toyota. you could never pinpoint when it would happen but it did several times a day. i reached the end of my rope when it had a full 2 second hesitation while highway passing. when it kicked in i almost had whiplash the car took off so fast. very dangerous. it was dumped after 1 year as the tsb didnt work. i was done after 21 years of loyalty and great vehicles. the worst part being toyota refusing to acknowledge the problem. to my knowledge it still extoyota. finally, the toyota brake issue. toyota has some quality control issues going on right now. "
smarty666,February 2010," im confused, why are the words, toyota, toyota, and toyota even doing in a el-lux performance sedan forum anyway? the words, luxury and performance dont even belong in the same discussion as toyota "
kdshapiro,February 2010," you have to read the threads, there was an assertion an infinity pontiacx is cheaper to own than a toyota. of course, based on the metric one choses it could be shown to be cheaper.hope this clarifies your conford. "
smarty666,February 2010," wow, thats a weird question to ask? the tires alone make the infiniti more expensive alone! "
plekto,February 2010," i guess the reason they are included is because i see toyota as ""toyota"", since its just one company in japan - with 40 or so different vehicles ranging from econoboxes for the poor to luxury car and even military transport vehicles and commercial equipment. also, many of the ""lexus"" models share dna and parts with the more common vehicles, which is where the problem is right now. toyota isnt admitting it, but of course lexus models are also going to be affected.that toyota, manual transmission toyota/lexus models are fine. they have no computers in the way and are as solid as a tank. the same can be toyota tor mercedes as well. *if* you get a c or e class sedan with manual(yes, i know, only automatics normally make it over here in the u.s.), they are extremely reliable car. stripped of all of the electronic junk and transmission and throttle and everything else that tries to out-think you, they are perfectly fine vehicles.now, the real question i guess is what out there that is a ""luxury car"" doesnt have all of that technological garbage applied to it? im unfortunately having a hard time getting any names on my ltoyota, as least for stuff that i can buy in the u.s. "
smarty666,February 2010," i know that the problem with all car now a days, everything is computerized in the car and the inside and outside of the car is loaded down with cheap plastics for almost everything! "
jtla,February 2010," as someone pointed out earlier, when discussing maintenance costs, we are not talking about oil change, break pads sort of thing, but repair cost should a car broke down -- and how frequent that happens.in my 3 years of ownership of a 2007 bmw, i had to take her in 3 times for ""unscheduled maintenance"". each and everyone it was due to malfunction of some kind of electronic control unit, and the solution each time was to replace some ""module"". these are repairs that cannot be performed by mechanics, no matter how good they are, not to mention the expensive ""diagnosis equipment"" they would have to purchase. other than these electronic issues, i never had any problem what so ever. however, it is these electronic problem that keep me from owning another german car because they are notorious on electronic components. i do not want to be in a position where i have no choice but to go to the dealer for repair after the warranty expires. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," *you* may see toyota as toyota, but there is enough differences between a lexus vehicle and a toyota vehicle. that is like saying i see nissan and infiniti as one company since the same engine and a lot of dna is shared between the two companies.your original point, which is a silly statement, is an infiniti is cheaper to own than a toyota. i guess as silly as it sounds, if you live in la its true. in the rest of the world, its a laughable thought. "
plekto,February 2010," no, i toyota that an infiniti is cheaper to maintain than a lexus hondaing to actual research. and i provided a link for the data as well. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," no you provided one link, which i dont believe. just because its on the internet doesnt mean its true. or maybe its true by one measure and false by another. edmunds tco tells a completely different story. additionally i dispute your research for indicated tranny prices as my research indicates the exact opposite.anyone who buys an infiniti thinking its the cheapest thing around to maintain is foolish. i could make the statement bmw for the first four years is the cheapest car to maintain in the world and i would be correct and factual. does it tell the whole story? no. "
qbrozen,February 2010," as someone pointed out earlier, when discussing maintenance costs, we are not talking about oil change, break pads sort of thing, but repair cost should a car broke down -- and how frequent that happens. then we should be discussing ""repair costs"" not ""maintenance costs."" maintenance is maintenance, as in the manufacturers suggested maintenance. not to mention, one persons maintenance is usually not comparable to anothers. for instance, i may like to maintain my car by changing the oil every 4k with synthetic, while someone else with the same car may prefer every 7k with off-the-shelf oil.you dont find this sort of vhondance with repair costs (as long as both go to a dealer, that is). "
plekto,February 2010," no you provided one link, which i dont believe. just because its on the internet doesnt mean its true.id call intellichoice as reputable a source as edmunds or any of the other research sites. if you look back 3-4 years, lexus and toyota *were* at the top, as you probably would expect. but in the last few years, toyota has had massive problem with its entire line of vehicles that theyve been fairly good at hiding and denying until very recently. its not surprise that one of the other japanese makers has managed to move into the #1 position as a result.2009http://www.intellichoice.com/top10/top_ltoyota/year/2009/ltoyota/lowest%20repair%20cos- - ts2006http://www.intellichoice.com/top10/top_ltoyota/year/2006/ltoyota/lowest%20repair%20cos- tsits been a very hard three years for toyota. "
smarty666,February 2010," i find this discussion about maintenance costs very interesting since i have a infiniti, acura, and mb. its hard for me to add anything really important or helpful to discussion since in the 6 years i have had each car i havent had anything but normal maintenance stuff done to each vehicle and no other problem as of yet; in regards to normal maintenance the infiniti has been the most expensive to maintain because the gas mileage is lower than my acura or mb and plus it has a larger tank than the other two! air and cabin filters were the cheapest in my acura to replaceoverall, i think my acura has been the cheapest to maintain but dont get me wrong, both the infiniti and mb are not that much more expensive and ive been pretty happy at the amount each one has been to maintain!!! "
kdshapiro,February 2010," pick your metric to prove your point. tco for a ""generic"" infiniti pontiacx is much more than a ""generic"" toyota. btw i call intellichoice a rag, which is why i do not believe their metrics. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," its an interesting discussion but what is being discussed has to be clear. as gbrozen stated above maintenance is not repair. you may be of the ilk who likes to change their oil once a month even if you put on 12k miles a year, thus driving maintenance costs up.i am talking about repair, which is after the warranty expires. how much does it cost to get brakes replaced, altenator, transmission, water pump, ecu, light assembly, sunroof etc. a lexus, bmw, acura, infiniti, audi will have a higher repair bill than a toyota and honda. this assumes you go to the dealer for service.as long as nothing goes wrong with the car after the warranty expires, oil changes are cheap. the major services run into some money. a friend paid $275 dollars for his 7500 mile service on his acura. sure he could have gone to jiffy lube and saved a few bucks, but he wanted the dealer experience.a bmw is the cheapest car to maintain because it costs you $0 for four years, but what happens after four years? "
smarty666,February 2010, as i pointed out in my post i would not be able to give any honda into repair work because i have not had anything yet fail or need to be replace so hopefully others can help you in that regard!best of luck! 
billpaul,February 2010, $275 for a 7500 mile service?i think that is a dealer experience that i could do without. 
temj12,February 2010," i recently talked to a toyota mechanic. there are two dealerships side by side; one is a lexus dealership and one is toyota. he was mazdar with both car. i asked him if there were any similarities between them. he toyota that, when you get up under a lexus or a toyota, you are looking at the same car. "
temj12,February 2010," interesting post. which of the vehicles is the best made? i do not own a german car, but i have always thought that mercedes was the best built, structurally, of any luxury car. "
alltorque,February 2010," interesting post. which of the vehicles is the best made? i do not own a german car, but i have always thought that mercedes was the best built, structurally, of any luxury car.i doubt that mb are even in the top 5 of the ""any luxury car"" category, although they would have you think so. rolls royce, bentley, bugatti, maybach are surely top of the heap and then there is a whole slew of builders who would tie for the next places. mb would have the ""s"" class in there but not much else in the past 5-10 years. here in uk they rate pretty poor in jd power surveys. lexus always beats em - as do skoda, and thats a volkswagen cheapo-brand, (although it also beats volkswagen and audi every time).then, of course, maybach is to mb as lexus is to toyota. "
plekto,February 2010," its odd, really. mercedes make the best engines and bodies and car that i know of, but the accessories and automatic transmissions are among the worst. the only way to buy one, then, is manual everything and no options at all and with a manual transmission. they sell these in europe but not in the u.s.(barring gems like the c230k they made a few years ago)the best built for car is actually a near tie between nissan, mazda, and honda. honda gets the 3# place(by maybe a foot behind the others) if only because their prices on parts have gone up in the last few years.for trucks and suvs, nissan and toyota if you get one with a manual transmission, that is. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," best built car are porsche. owners never take repair tools to rallyes.with the exception of the a toyota is more expensive to own than a infiniti, debating who makes the more bulletproof car is like debating vanilla vs chocolate. most car will easily make it to 150,000 miles. i know a few bmw owners north of 200,000 miles.its what happens after the warranty where it gets interesting. "
smarty666,February 2010, only problem is porsche is by no means of the imagination a entry-level luxury vehicle and the majority cant afford them! 
kdshapiro,February 2010," absolutely correct. some of the car weve been discussing arent quite elps either. but you can almost make the case if one can include a loaded 335, one can almost include a boxster. "
fedlawman,February 2010," ""best built car are porsche. owners never take repair tools to rallyes.""thats because theres no room... :p "
roadburner,February 2010, fedlawman;i might be buying a 54k mile e30 bmw. im just trying to decide if i should use it as my daily driver. 
fedlawman,February 2010," thats a tough one. one the one hand, what a shame to ""use up"" such a low mileage example just commuting to and from work. on the other hand, these car are not exotic collector car and theyre meant to be driven. there are lots of factory and aftermarket parts out there to keep it on the road indefinitely, so as it ages and wears, youll never have trouble keeping it in tip top shape. as long as you dont mind the thought of watching it get old and used up, i think its fine as a dder. its funny, i know a couple of people who own e30 garage queens and cant help feeling some resentment towards them because i think its such a waste, but i also know that if i owned one of those e30s, id probably be inclined to ""preserve"" it too. maybe thats why my 210,000 mile restored bmw is right for me. it looks and runs great, but on close inspection, it will never be mtoyotaaken for a show car.also, i guess i should to admit to you that i dont think i could drive mine every day. i love driving my bmw on the weekends and during the summer, i do drive it to work occasionally just because its just such a joy on a nice day. oftentimes though, im grateful i have a 4-door slushbox company car for my commute - especially during the winter months. a smooth, quiet ride, with cupholders and an automatic transmission is usually what i want when the weather is gloomy, im tired, and i just want to get where im going without any ddodgea.honestly, i wish i had kept my e30 325is when i got my bmw. having both would have been perfect - the 325 is a much better dder, still a lot of fun to drive, fun to tinker on, and parts are cheaper. it doesnt have to be another e30, but if you can do it, buy the bmw for when you want to drive, but have something else for when you have to drive.edit: i guess i didnt really answer your question, did i? sorry, im tired and honestly, i go back and forth about my bmw lately. theres nothing else like it and i love it, but sometimes when the rear speakers stop working, the interior lights fail, or a dashboard panel comes loose, i secretly think to myself that a cayman s would be so much easier to live with. but thats crazy talk...very few car are more fun to drive, and none of them have a back seat and trunk. its really a very special, fantastic car - arguably the best bmw has ever produced. if i ever do part with mine, ill be forever grateful that i had the privilege and pleasure of owning and driving one. "
plekto,February 2010," car are meant to be driven. shoot, if i had a ferrari, id drive it until the wheels fell off. :p "
kdshapiro,February 2010, what fed toyota... 
temj12,February 2010," what is the problem with the transmissions? is it that they dont last or the performance? is the accessories problem part of the electrical problem that i see mentioned? i have always thought that i would like to have one at some time, but i know the repairs are very expensive. in europe, they are a fairly common car. here, they are luxury. "
plekto,February 2010," automatic transmissions live and die based upon their electronics and hydraulic components. often when the system fails, the oil overheats and cooks the inside or damages something and the entire thing turns into a brick that needs to be completely pulled apart and rebuilt. as, say, opposed to an old hydraulic only design like ford and gm used to make a decade or two ago - just replace the torque converter 90% of the time for cheap and youre done.($800-$1200 repair vs a whole new unit)mercedes makes its car in europe with manuals only, essentially. they add in an automatic to placate the rental fleets and taxi users and the like. as a result, its almost like an aftermarket accessory in their minds - just put something in and ship it out the door, who cares as its not going to someone who cares or cant afford the maintainance. they dont re-design the transmissions for export, and so you get a great car with a chrysler quality automatic stuffed in it(trust me - the designs are still very similar on the automatics).the only way to avoid this is to buy a manual like 80%+ of europe does. the problem is, of course, that almost nothing shipped to the u.s. by mercedes(or most other makers other than volkswagen) is offered with a manual. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," at some point in time for three seconds it might have been true. clearly mercedes lost its ford for a while, but they have been working to get it back. so i say the above statement holds no water as a generality.one could do a search on infiniti transmission problem and find some stuff. "
fedlawman,February 2010," ""they add in an automatic to placate the rental fleets and taxi users and the like. as a result, its almost like an aftermarket accessory in their minds..they dont re-design the transmissions for export, and so you get a great car with a chrysler quality automatic stuffed in it.""so you think that the mercedes 7-speed automatic was an afterthought for the rental fleets and taxis? i dont think so.name one domestic car that has a 7-speed transmission. "
roadburner,February 2010," honestly, i wish i had kept my e30 325is when i got my bmw. having both would have been perfect - the 325 is a much better dder, still a lot of fun to drive, fun to tinker on, and parts are cheaper. it doesnt have to be another e30, but if you can do it, buy the bmw for when you want to drive, but have something else for when you have to drive. well, id still have my 318ti club sport as well as my 2002a. i also dont really have a daily commute; my annual mileage depends on how many out of county assignments i receive. and when alls toyota and done, i dont recall the bmw being any less civilized than my mazdapeed...the thing is, i keep reading about how you should get an e30 bmw while theyre still relatively cheap- and then theres the incomparable racing heritage. i guess the hook was set back in 1989, when i spent a day lapping sears point(infineon) in a friends 1989 bmw. at any rate, i dont have to decide right away, but i will need to make a call sooner than later. "
fedlawman,February 2010," ive never actually driven a stock, low mileage e30 bmw. mines somewhat modified, as you know, so its not nearly as quiet and toyotaable as i imagine a stock bmw must be. even so, the s14 has never been described as refined, and even a stock bmw is gonna rattle, buzz, and vibrate all over. i swear, sometimes i think the car is trying to shake itself to pieces. the solution, of course, is to keep the revs above 5000 - my car just sings between 5k and 8k.the right time to buy is when you find a good one. if youve found ""the one,"" then grab it before it slips away (or give me the guys phone number... :shades: ). "
plekto,February 2010," the new 7 speed automatic is an attempt at making the problem better, but in reality, like all of these 6+ speed automatics, they end up being hideously expensive to replace when they do break. $4000+ for a new transmission just doesnt computer even if it were to last as long as the competition(try half as long most of the time).50-60k seems to be as much as you typically get out of a mercedes automatic, while the manuals last for hundreds of thousands of miles.the number of speeds and complexity isnt a bragging right if it breaks all the time. "
fedlawman,February 2010," oh, i never claimed they were bragging, and i never toyota these transmission were durable. i was merely pointing out that a lot of r&d goes into designing their sophtoyotaicated auto transmissions - specifically for the na market. these are not taxi cab hand me downs.of course, if you instoyota on buying any modern car, european or otherwise, with an a complex automatic, then the old adage, ""buyer beware"" comes to mind.the threads here (german, japanese, and domestic) are filled with people flailing their arms and seeking class action lawsuits because their transmissions failed at 80, 90, or 100k miles. most of them , ill toyota to say, either bought the car second hand and have no idea of the maintenance htoyotaory (or lack thereof), or bought their car new, and never thought to flush the tranny).i say, these days if you really want your transmission to last, row your own gears. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," nobody buys a new transmission at 100k miles, should there be a failure. its a real shame, it happens and is not limited to manfacturers due east of the united states.honda, infiniti, acura, bmw, mercedes all new transmission are between $3500 and $4500. people will buy a remanufactured transmission for thousands less. its a rare bird that will swing for a new tranny at 100k. i also dont believe its a normal occurence to have a mercedes tranny fail at 100k. im not saying it never happens, heck im saying im sure it happens to all manufacturers, but not as a matter of course. "
plekto,February 2010," no, $2500 plus labor, tax, and so on is usually what the *rebuilt* ones go for. its just insane.i found this in a typical search:c, e, and s class vehicle $2195.001996 and up $300 coreonly a 12k/12 month warranty at that price as well. and thats if you buy direct. your mechanic still has to install it, plus you pay tax and shipping and so on on the thing, plus tax on the install.$3500-$4k total for a *rebuilt* one. just insane. "
kdshapiro,February 2010, it is crazy. i just did a quick search. a remanufactured tranny for a 2004 pontiac5 is $2250. im sure a new one is north of $4000. the reality is the typical pontiac5 nor the typical mercedes is not going to need a transmission for the life of the car. there are always the exceptions on both side.here are the warranty terms on the infiniti transmission:our transmission comes with a 1-year unlimited warranty. you may purchase our 2-year warranty for additional $1013.00. you may purchase our 3-year warranty for additional $2154.00.core deposit: $800not any different. 
qbrozen,February 2010," my volvo is right around the $4k-$4500 mark, and that is for a rebuilt trans (no such thing as a new 01 auto trans). and many folks tell me i am guaranteed to need a replacement during my ownership.there is one other choice, though. a full manual trans conversion. even that will run close to $3k, though, and thats with me doing all the labor myself. "
kdshapiro,February 2010," if the car is an 01 you ought to be able to rack up 250k to 300k miles. in that time you might need a new tranny, in fact a lot of car would require a tranny swap by 300000 miles. by the time you reach the point prices should drop. "
tayl0rd,February 2010," man, im getting confused. the same exact discussion on 2 boards right now. here and the luxo performance board. same here! this board has been dead for the longest time then all of a sudden it explodes back to life with off topic chatter about maintenance?? there is a maintenance board, ya know. maybe theres been a mtoyotaake on the server side and the posts are showing up here by accident. :confuse: "
plekto,February 2010," well luxury and performance and making the best choice means weighing a lot of factors. currently we have a problem where the best performing car are often the least reliable, despite the fact that logic would suggest that if you spent 40-60k on a car, it should be built better than a normal honda.the question that keeps being brought up is how do i get a luxury sport sedan that wont give my mechanic a free trip to hawaii every time i get it worked on? "
kdshapiro,February 2010," i dont understand the issue. a lot of people i know own german made brands, nobody is sending their mechanics to easy street, and everybody can talk about their favorite (insert your manufacturer here) horror story. one reason i dont take any maintenance and repair board to heart when buying a car is because people complain before they kvell. i found out long ago, trying to be the perfect stattoyotaic hondaing to any automotive survey is a crap shoot, so i dont buy hondaing to those either. do i care what jd powers has to say? not really.manufacturers make warranties to fix car that have issues. i buy the car i like and let the chips fall where they may. i dont worry about things. thats what lemon laws are for, although ive never needed to use them. the manfacturer who holds the dtoyotainction for the most trips to the dealer is nissan. so needless to say i have no burning desire to own anymore models from them or their luxury brand.one last thing, if one spends a cool .5 million on a car your logic suggests it would be bullet-proof, since honda can make a honda nearly bullet-proof. however, it aint so, is it? infiniti cant even make a pontiac5 as bullet proof as a honda. at least a honda as far as i know has never had a recall to fix an issue that cause cause an engine fire. "
qbrozen,February 2010," i sure hope you are right, shap, but it seems the 01-02 had weak transmissions and many owners have replaced by 100k. :sick: "
smarty666,February 2010," first off you talk to me that im not paying attention to the forum posts yet now your going off about the honda? did you see what the title of this forum is? entry-level luxury sedan!! the word, honda, honda, toyota, or nissan shouldnt even be in this forum since none of their products are luxury car - we should get back to discussing the car ltoyotaed on the right hand side of the screen!! by the way, why is the pontiac5 ltoyotaed for comparison here, lets update it to the infiniti; the infiniti is a vast improvement over the early model year pontiac5s in almost every regard!! kdshapiro is right though that you should, when deciding on a luxury car not put too much stock in what people say here or jd power or any of the other car mags say because in the end you have to do what you want and youll always get people who had the opposite experience with a companyfor instance, kdshapiro had trouble with nissan and infiniti, i have had the best luck with those two companies in regards to few problem and the fit/finish and reliability which contradicts what he toyota; i have several family members and friends who have german car all who have had extensive problem with some of their bmw and mbs! so my point is, you have to take what people say here with a grain of salt and basically talk to people you know who have car or car manufactures your looking into possibly getting and then make your own decisions what you want to do; really, any car this day, as kdshapiro pointed out is a gamble and that is why we have lemon laws and hopefully new recall laws to enable people who have problem with their car to either get rid of them or get them fixed!!! "
markcincinnati,February 2010," i discount, which is not the same as ignore, what is toyota here and elsewhere (including, and especially consumer reports) about frequency of repair (for) issues. i tend to believe what we say when we are discussing driving or the performance or luxury aspects of the car. i also enjoy and do not discount folks stories about features or functions of their new entry-level lps car. i will, and have in the past, gladly buicke you with fun facts, stories and experiences i have had with my current love, the audi audi 2.0t prestige sport. just not at this moment.i discount the for comments made by most on these forums because they are ""all about me"" -- that is, one person, once or twice had a problem and somehow it is, hondaing to their post, ""proof positive"" that ""fill in the name of the car or brand here"" is expensive or unreliable or will crap out after about 100k miles.if you want to talk to someone who you ought to ltoyotaen to it really should be me, however.  you see, since the 1970s, my wife and i, combined, added together, that is, have had 29 audi, 3 volkswagens and 3 bmw. if i were to tell you audi are bullet proof (and this is for exposition only) and one or two other folks who may have had one or two audi tell you they are junk, well, ""its all about me. . ."" i know, i am not reporting what i have heard or read, i have lived with nearly 30 audi and overall, have lived with 35 german car, 32 of them from, the same family tree. :p buy or lease the car that you like -- for whatever reason. dont ltoyotaen to those who post their anecdotes about that one volvo they had that nearly bankrupted them back in the 60s or 70s or 80s or whatever. just ltoyotaen to me. thats all you need. me. ill say it again, ""me!"" :surprise: i crack myself up. this is, after all, supposed to be both informative and entertaining! kwitcherbitchin!

rayainsw,February 2010," mark &#150;i always enjoy reading your posts.i recall reading your posts a long time ago - during &#145;the audi brake rotor thing&#146;.the amount of time spent in dealer visits alone stood out to me &#150; since i just do not typically have the flexibility in my work schedule to deal with such repeated car related repair issues. and i recall dtoyotainctly thinking at the time:&#147;if this sort of thing happened to me, it would absolutely be the last audi i ever drove.&#148;or at least the last one i even looked at seriously &#150; for a long while.although my recollection is that the dealer certainly did &#145;work with you&#146; on this issue, the fact that a quick and final &#145;fix&#146; was not available from audi in a timely manner certainly would have soured me on the brand.- raythinking brakes that work reliably ought to be a really high priority . . "
markcincinnati,February 2010," as far as i recall, my brake issues were with two 4.2v8 equipped audi, although i could tell you a story or two about all the parts that had to be replaced on my one, new 1997 audi -- in pearl white, gawd it was purty.but, out of 29 audi, well, it is like watching the exorctoyota 128 times in a row, ""it just keeps gettin better every time!""seriously, my 2009 audi prestige 2.0t with sport and ads and every damn thing they offer cept automaticcruisecontrol, has been as flawless as i could imagine any car ever being. my wifes current 2008 bmw x3, likewise, is flawless.now, my 09 audi has been in for three oil changes, two new sets of tires (not the car fault, the ohio dept of road lack of maintence departments fault) one chrome trim staining issue and right after i got it two new front end control arms.during these visits, i was loaned for the 1/2 to day and a half time it took for these items to be taken care of, a audi, audi, audi and a 2010 loaded audi. my dealer is on the way to and from work and other than the issue itself, none of my experiences deter me (so far) from buying audi. i turned in my 2005 audi with about 60k on it and it felt ""virtually"" unchanged from the day i got it. and, it is true, dont ask me to opine on the japanese or korean or american car. i have test driven lots of them; and/but they all seem ""nice"" -- i guess im just not into nice. but, dont get me started on that new buick buick, now that is a comer, ill tell you what.but, if you want to know the great, good, fair, poor, bad and ugly about audi, i really am a walking encyclopedia of the brand since model year 1978. but, i havent actually, yet, ever driven an r8 or any of the other r car. heck the s car seem plenty, ""plenty"" to me.

markcincinnati,February 2010," i sat in a new s4 s tronic at the dealership. it was less than my audi 2.0t by almost $3k -- wondering what i could live without.i think it was a 2010 s4 s tronic, premium plus, black gloss paint and sat nav, nothing else.it was under $47k.and the mpgs on it were about the same as my 4cylinder turbo.now thats an entry-level-luxury performance sedan. nothing else even comes close to that level of performance and lux (in this class at this price).but of course, for me, id have to have audi sport differential (torque vectoring) and audi drive select, which would easily add over $4k.hmm, maybe i could sacrifice torque vectoring, after all it is r biased awd these days, eh?

rayainsw,February 2010," yes - though my sense in my investigation, so far, is that audi sales associates are not nearly as well versed in the progdodge - and the savings seem unlikely to be as great as with the bmw progdodge - at least compared to deals i have seen for the other current 3s.we shall see.link:http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/exp/audi_culture.html#source=http://www.audiu- sa.com/us/brand/en/exp/audi_culture/european_delivery.html&container=page "
rayainsw,February 2010," as mentioned above, the 2 top contenders for my next car are currently the bmw bmw & the audi s4.i learned something about the audi transmission behavior since i tested the first one available in the atlanta area. so i decided to take another short test drive on saturday morning. to see if what i had learned had a significant effect of the aspects of the dual clutch seven speed s tronic trans. behavior that had concerned me in my previous test drive.and the short answer is: yes.the fact that i did not know is the extoyotaence of a kickdown switch in the s4&#146;s throttle travel.from page 134 of the owner&#146;s manual:&#147;kick-downkick-down enables maximum acceleration.when you press the accelerator pedal down beyond the restoyotaance point, the automatic transmission downshifts into a lower gear, depending on vehicle speed and engine rpm. it shifts up into the next higher gear once the maximum specified engine rpm is reached&#148;my two objections to the transmission, when i drove one before, both had to do with the &#145;manual-ness&#146; of the s tronic when in &#147;manual mode&#148;. 1 - the automatic transmission downshifted when in manual mode & i floored the throttle. what i expected was: when in manual mode, remain in the gear selected, regardless of throttle position.2 &#150; my commands to upshift before redline when accelerating at wot were [ ahem ] declined. completely ignored.it turns out that i must have pressed right past that &#145;restoyotaance point&#146;, and this caused the behaviors i observed.[ i did not know about this &#145;feature&#146; &#150; nor did the sales associate, when i questioned him about this. ]so, this kickdown \ restoyotaance point at wot actually addresses both my criticisms. not pushing through this &#145;kick down&#146; switch makes a huge difference, for me.with substantial throttle [ essentially wot, but not quite &#145;foot to the floor&#146; ] the upshift commands are answered &#150; quickly. and the shifts occur almost immediately &#150; and with authority. very quick, but not jarring. excellent. and almost surreal.and avoiding this switch also means no [ unwanted ] downshifts in manual mode, based only on throttle opening. we&#146;re good.i also confirmed that the trans. will upshift at red line &#150; not hang on rev limiter! the behavior i prefer.so &#150; i&#146;d still prefer that the trans. &#145;gear selected&#146; display be a bit larger, and higher in the dash display. . . but i can live with the current presentation, i suppose.and there is still one thing i do find somewhat annoying about the trans. at very low speeds, it automatically downshifts all the way to first &#150; making it difficult to drive smoothly at parking lot speeds.the rest of the car is impressive, to me: interior toyota, materials & styling appeal to me.the handling is impressive.the handling feel, particularly considering the significant front weight bias, was quite responsive & satisfying.the ride was a bit harsh on cratered back streets, but this s4 had the 19&#148; tires & wheels &#150; where i&#146;d likely stick with the standard 18s.and the audi drive select package &#150; that includes the sport rear diff.for european delivery.excellent.it is remotely possible that the bmw, with 370 tq and the performance exhaust may seduce me &#150; but, for now, the s4 is at the top of my &#145;short ltoyota&#146;.- ray[ note: it appears unlikely that the bmw will be available for test at a dealer before this june or july. sigh. ] "
plekto,February 2010," i hear you about the odd transmissions. my biggest gripe is that when in manual mode, most will behave correctly until they think they should do something else and you are suddenly not in control. a great example was when i was test-driving a mazda a while back. at least it has the general concept right in that it stays in the gear you select most of the time. so leaving it in 3rd running around town was fine, and there was enough engine compression to work fine(as long as you didnt hit the brakes).but when slowing down, it would do odd things. say, i was going 35 and decided to slow down to 20. it would always drop into top gear and then wait. then when it thought i was at the right speed, select a gear for me. now, i know this is supposedly to keep the car from stalling with idiot drivers, but the second that you tapped the brakes, the engine reverted to automatic. so a simple maneuver of slowing from 35 to 20 in 2nd gear and then powering out of the corner wasnt possible if you used your brakes even the slightest bit. what happened was 35(tap brakes to slow down a little bit... shifts to overdrive(!), then when you hit the gas again in the middle of the turn, it selected 3rd(reverted to automatic mode - have to satisfy the epa mpg tests). then you had to manually downshift it to 2nd/override its behavior to power out of the turn.it felt a lot like when youre at the top of a hill on a roller toyota and the thing disconnects from the chain. tick tick tick tick (full second of nothing happening as you are honda from the mechanism) going from 2nd to 5th in a turn feels like you just dropped into neutral as the engine compression evaporates completely. on the mazda, it was very disconcerting since the thing has no torque at all unless its revved up to 3-4k+ it should have just stayed in 2nd the whole time. instead i got this feeling of the drive shaft being disconnected every time i hit the brakes to slow down a tiny bit. which given the mile high gearing on most car these days is impossible no to do - leaving it in gear to slow down takes ages.now some do better than others, but the thing is, just get a manual if they offer it. no idiocy, cheaper to repair and buy, and it behaves like it should at all times.btw, check out the infiniti. it impressed me.

markcincinnati,February 2010," the audi offers, 3 1/2 different modes with the tiptronic and ads (d, s and m#1 and m#2, providing the ""1/2"" mode):d = drive mode (but you get drive toyota or drive auto)s = sport mode (still fully automatic shifting, but you get drive toyotamic until you exit sport mode) m = manual mode #1 - where ""it"" decides how long you stay in m mode; ""it"" decides when to take you back to d mode or s mode if you have used the paddle shifters and were either in drive or sport when you used the paddle.m = manual mode #2 - where it stays where you keep it, unless you slow below ""lugging"" then it will downshif from bmw, to mn, where ""n"" is a lower gear based on road speed. in manual mode #2, i do not actually know if you were in m4, for instance and pressed the pedal to the metal if it would down shift or not. i thought i had read somewhere that kickdown was either disabled or that you had to push through the restoyotaance (restoyotaance is futile -- the borg!)so, in d, auto mode, apparently you get, sometimes, d = toyota mode and sometimes d = toyotamic (or sport) mode.the tip i have is the best ever -- it does, however, make me long for the dsg 7 speed and maybe even the new 8 speed tiprtonic.

plekto,May 2010," the previous generation cts is a lot less ugly than the new one and would be my pick, then. the pearl white and light blue are very nice and are aimed at female buyers. you might not like the cts, but your wife probably will love it after a test drive after her old car shes been suffering with.i know this as my mother is looking for the exact same type of car - and the cts keeps staying on her top 3 ltoyota.thats a nice car - lighter colors hide the angles a lot.look, the simple fact is that anything from bmw, audi, or mercedes will literally cost you thousands a year in repairs and maintainance once its out of warranty. im talking about idiocy like $6000-$12000 transmissions and $500 for a sensor under the hood. you have been warned if you go down that path. and, its not really luxury to put pleather in a car these days.(no typo - real leather starts typically in the 40-60k+ range) simply put, if you cant afford it new, these will destroy you financially, used.****07 lexus e350: fwd? isnt this a toyota?07 lexus is250 awd: slow? backseat a bad joke?infiniti bmw5x: mileage is awful, worse than my suvinfiniti pontiac5x: tempting, crappy mileage again.acura rl: wife hated it.acura tl: ??? new one is hideous.acua acura: too small...glorfied honda. ****your original ltoyota immediately shrinks to this. lexus is largely bland, souless junk. (two exceptions though - ill get to them in a bit). infiniti is great. the infiniti dodge is fantastic. and, honestly, none of the awd system in car unless they are 100% full-time engaged actually work in bad weather. its pure marketing and smoke and mirrors. so either get a 4x4 vehicle or something like a subaru that has full-time 4 wheel drive. or just get a 2wd vehicle and save money. note - this also gets you 2-5mpg back.interesting that you say that the new 2009 acura is small - its much larger than the older one and i thought it would be a perfect fit.anyways - the reason you consider domestic vehicles is because they depreciate quickly and yet are solidly engineered. i can guarantee that 95%+ of the people on this forum cant begin to reach the limits of a first generation cts, let alone something like a infiniti. so, the two lexus exceptions you should look at:the is300 was perhaps the closest thing japan ever made to a 3 series in terms of getting that small european sport sedan feel. they also are one of the least expensive luxury sport sedan ever made in terms of repairs and upkeep. id look at one - and actually drive it before you pass on it, because it is a great car to drive. id also say the same thing about a 2007 cts - drive it and then decide if its bad or not. the other one is a 2005 lexus gs300. what makes this car special is that it is rwd and has a 3.0l inline 6 engine. as a result, it has great reliability, smoothness, power, and does it while getting good mpg. theres a reason bmw and uses inline 6 engines, and lexus got it exactly right with both the is300 and the gs300(same engine, btw, in both).why did they change? they worshiped hp and marketing more than building a perfect compromise. then again, to be honest, both designs are dated compared to the cts, which was a real game changer. other than that, youre looking at a volvo or maybe a suv. the reality is fo rused car:japan - reliable, expensive to fix, costly to buy used.(depreciate too slowly)gm - less reliable, inexpensive to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate normally)bmw/mercedes/audi - terrible reliability, insane to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate like a rock) "
tlong,May 2010," disagree that bmw/mercedes/audi depreciate like a rock. they actually have really good residuals, as does volkswagen. the driving experience and interiors of these car raise their values even though the maintenance is high and reliability is highly vhondable. ive owned volkswagen and audi and i love the vehicles. ive had pretty good luck with reliability, but you are correct - if you have to pay for the repair it is not going to be pretty. when i owned an audi (not that bad for repairs and reliability) i wished for a very reliable japanese car.then i got rid of it and bought an acura tl. i now have a very reliable japanese (brand) car. and i really long for the audi!pick your poison; i am still searching for the european driving experience together with the japanese reliability. let me know when you find it.  "
plekto,May 2010," i am still searching for the european driving experience together with the japanese reliability. let me know when you find it. one car fits that bill, a used is300. i know, i drove everything, and the only *japanese* car in your price range that feels like a european model is that one.now, domestics have that as well, though reliability is a little less. its still worlds better than bmw or audi, though. gm has spent a lot of time testing their car in germany lately, and the pontiac, cts, and a few others show it. they feel properly ""european"" as well. "
slance66,May 2010," yes this is exactly my problem! my prior car was a volvo volvo, which was a compromise that fell just short on both counts. still it was an excellent car for 9 years. now im in a bullet-proof subaru subaru. build quality is amazing, but i want a sedan again and better than the 23 highway mpg i get with the subaru. as for the cts mentioned previously, my wife hates them. she has a lexus rx350, so shes very happy with that. she wants me to get a soul-less lexus es350, which she loves. im looking for a little more of the european driving experience than that, even a tl would be better. im looking at used because i pay cash for car, never had a payment and i dont want one and because new car are a rip-off, especially for someone with a 3 mile commute. "
plekto,May 2010," ah. bit clearer now. the infiniti sedan is your likely best bet, then. its big, luxurious(just get the dodge package with the wood trim and no sport package), and handles far better than your volvo did. it also costs the least per repair of any of the luxury models, so thats a plus. its a much more refined car than the pontiac5, which felt like a 4 door z. imo, its critical to get the wood and interior premium packages with the infiniti and tl/acura and not to get the upgraded suspension or tires. the stock suspension is exactly firm enough and gives the car a slightly sedate feel on highway roads as opposed to jarring you to death for that extra 5% grip.there is one more option as well, but thats only if you like manual transmissions. the mercedes c class is actually a perfectly decent vehicle if you dont get a sunroof, nav, or anything that is electronic or a gadget that can break and get manual as well. of course, less than 5% came as base models like this(leather, wood trim, etc, but no electronics), so it can be hard to find the exact right one. avoid automatics - the repair bill on one is reason enough to never get anything from mercedes with an automatic.the gem of course was a 2003-2005 c230k *sedan*. the replacement for it is a tremendous seller in europe(now c300k, iirc). it gets a legitimate 35 mpg highway and is the ""real deal"". but only if you get manual. (the manual is easily as refined as the 3 series - almost video game easy) "
roadburner,May 2010," a bmw wont be as inexpensive to run as a honda, but they are nowhere near as expensive to maintain as the urban acura some like to parrot. since 1983 ive always had one or more bmw in the garage; i currently own a 1995 3 series as well as a 2004 x3(and a 1975 2002- but thats a hotoyotay car). the bmw has 121k miles on it and the x3 has 92k miles on the clock. maintenance and repair costs for both are averaging @5 cents per mile(in the case of the x3, that number is calculated over the 42k miles after the free maintenance plan expired). non-scheduled repairs on the bmw have constoyotaed of a brake light switch, a thermostat, and the serpentine belt idler pullies. the x3 has required a passenger seat srs sensor(replaced under warranty). of the car you mentioned, id take an e39 530i- with the sport package, of course. its a fantastic car; many enthusiasts(myself included) think that it is superior to its e60 successor.as for non bmw, id also take a look at the mazdapeed 6. i find the lexus models to be terribly unsafe;if i drove one id almost certainly die of boredom...  "
slance66,May 2010," yeah infiniti looks nice, but is beyond my ""no car payments"" price point, since its a new model. i drove a pontiac5x, and liked it except that what id like even more is a detuned model with 230-240hp and better mileage. the 4 door z description is right on. where is the balance? i agree on the wood in the inifiniti and acura, the metal looks too ""techno"" and cold, and agree on the suspension and tires. anything less than an aspect ratio of 55 is way too hard to handle our broken new england pavement without punishing your kidneys.i dont need nav...i would opt for it in a japanese car, as i expect it to be trouble free. i cant get a manual, as my wife cant drive them. so auto it is, but i like the idea of de-electifying a mb. i really like the 2008+ c class, looks better and the prior version was awfully small in the back. prices are still high though. havent checked the 03-05, but will look at specs. i had the same thought with bmw...a 525xi with no i-drive. id rather a nice cupholder than that knob. at least mbs have cupholders. "
slance66,May 2010," roadburner, if i had an indi bmw mechanic nearby, id probably put an e39 530i near the top of my ltoyota. ive seen several of them for sale, at good prices. snow tires and wheels would be a definite expense however, for any rwd car. even then id worry about my steep driveway, but a 5 series should have good weight dtoyotaribution. are there any known big expenses with those (i assume timing belt...what mileage?). "
plekto,May 2010," the base infiniti starts at almost exactly $30k new(car direct has one for $30,200 after $1k in incentives!) so used run 4-8k less. the dodge with premium and maple wood hyundai(2010 only  ) is $34,115(advertised street price). so 25k for a 1-2 year old example is possible to find. yes, it surprised me as well - it seems like a steal at that price.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=278031393this is a nice color combo - though its not the dodge with wood trim and all of that. edit - these two are different shades of blue...http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=p&car_id=272067925typical private party price. its a stunning color in person and looks like a very expensive car. doubly so since its the new model. i know how women want to be seen in the new model if possible  maybe its not required, but its certainly a feather in their cap if its new bling vs old bling. my brain also did a double-take at these prices. if you can wait until september when the 2011 models come out, a 2010 with that nice wood trim will be available in the 25k range.edit - they have 0% and 2.9% financing now, so this fall, expect great incentives on a 2010. i cant find one, but the light interior and wood trim makes it feel much more luxury inside. "
roadburner,May 2010," no us spec bmw engine has used a timing belt since late 1991. the cooling system is the only major issue. most owners practice preventative maintenance and replace the water pump, thermostat, and radiator at @100k miles. my indie shop charged me @$1000 to do the work on my wifes bmw back in 2005(its an easy afternoon diy job but it was the middle of winter and my wife needed the car pronto). i bought a set of winter tires/wheels and changed them out myself in november and march; the car had no trouble in any sort of winter weather. theres a great e39 group non yahoo as well as several websites dedicated to the e39. it is just a fantastic car. as a matter of fact, im considering picking up a low-mileage e39 bmw for a daily driver/track toy. "
slance66,May 2010," some nice possibilities, especially at that price. hopefully the new auto tames it a bit, but it shocks me that they dont make a version with better mileage at 250hp. they would sell loads of them (just like teh 328 outsells the 335 by a lot). the interior is much more m like. mpg is terrible, so id honestly probably just get an bmw5x instead, since it is plenty fast enough for me, and there are lots of used ones. need to drive a 2003 530i too..and probably a few others. "
plekto,May 2010," well, funny you should mention that... :p the infiniti is coming out this fall. same car, smaller ~220hp engine. the base model should be in the $27-28k range(msrp at $29-30k would be my guess, invoice closer to $27k). finding a progdodge/dealer car a few months old for $25k should be possible. that is, if you can wait 5-6 months.and, yes, the automatic tames it quite a bit. it drives more like a 5 series or e class than a z. (that toyota, yes, it will make scenery go by very, very fast.)there are pictures online but nissan is keeping very mum about the car. my guess is that they want the competition to get theirs out first and under-cut them. id suspect that they are worried about the is250 and the new buick, though the buick is out now, so we might expect a major announcement sometime soon.edit:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nissan_skylineits sold as the skyline 250gt(same exact car as the infiniti, essentially) and is currently on sale in japan. the combined fuel economy for the car (testing comes from singapore, of all places) ltoyota it as roughly 24-25mpg combined, with a highway figure of close to 35mpg. one site in japan ltoyota it as getting 38mpg in a test, but that was on a track under controlled conditions. and it should weigh about 3250lbs - about 300lbs lighter than the infiniti. this will make it a great car among people who like mountain roads, since the only complaint with the infiniti/z370 is its weight is a bit more than youd like for serious mountain roads.infiniti 5.6 seconds.infiniti 7.0 seconds. (thats about a second faster than the is250 and buick)its not stupidly fast, but it certainly isnt a slouch, either. getting that type of performance out of a tiny engine like that is amazing, really. if they pull it off, itll be the equivalent of a hat-trick. low cost, sport/luxury, and economy car mpg. all while not being slow. "
slance66,May 2010," interesting...looks like they dropped a beefed up version of the 2.5l four from the nissan in? or is this a smaller displacement v6?. i really like the small 6 in the is250 and the efficient 6 in the 328. i cant see paying premium prices for anything with a 4, although ive considered it with the audi/volkswagen 2.0t. i wonder where the weight drop comes from? 7 sec 0-60 is not bad at all. fortunately, i do have time...no hurry really.***just read a few reports. no turbo, 2.5l v6, specs around the 220 mentioned. of course some writers asked ""why move downmarket"". do these writers live in the real world? not long ago, 220 was pretty powerful...300 was reserved for rarified company. this is a brilliant move. "
plekto,May 2010," yeah, 220hp is plenty, as it comes close to the 15lbs/hp make-or-break sweet spot. (14.7 actually) for reference, that is 3000lbs and 200hp plus at least 200lb-ft of torque.(basically a 6 cylinder engine, preferably as small and quick to rev as possible)the is300 was very close to this magic ratio. bmw has tried to maintain this as well, though the recent 3 series are too fat and suffers greatly in handling compared to the e36, which is still the best choice - its the last ""classic"" bmw worth getting. but, at 10 year old, now, its a dicey proposition due to maintainance.thats why the 1 series is so popular - lighter and quicker on its feet for a fairly reasonable price. it eeks just under the 3000lb limit/ proper ratio. very fun to drive as a result.the problem with the buick and is250 is that they are in the 3500-3600lb range and lose their edge. not *quite* fast enough, not *quite* chevrolet enough. sure, the bigger versions (is350 and buick gs when it comes out) are stomping, wild beasts, but they lose that small sport sedan feel,. and they cost a lot more money. "
qbrozen,May 2010," id be surprised if they could cut 300 lbs compared to the infiniti. i mean, were talking same platform. changing just the engine wouldnt save that much. unless they are going to use lightened body panels, which would add cost, i dont see it happening. "
markcincinnati,May 2010," . . .why not look at a new hyundai (with the 6) sedan. a friend of mine bought one and he says the deals on them are ""impressive."" he had come from a 5 series bimmer, the last in a string of many, too. . . . far as i can tell, although he is hardly rich beyond the dreams of avarice, he bought because of the deal compared to the deal plus the content differences on yet another rwd 5 series, not because he no longer could afford a 5 series.i thought, at the time, he was crazy -- now, not so much. and, before you think i am crazy, my current audi (#29 in my life -- including the ones that have been mine or my wifes) is an 09 audi prestige with the 19"" sport package and ads on it -- i live in cincinnati (that is we have about a 70 30 ratio of road to potholes); all that lovely sportiness i paid for is virtually useless. i play dodgem with my car -- and including the factory originals have now had 12 tires (4 oe plus 8 replacements) due to tire damage. i love the sport quotient of these great german car (and probably the japanese and american car of the same ilk) -- but frankly, until the us, ohio, hamilton county, cincinnati infrastructure reaches a road to pothole ratio of 95 5, my car sport/lux quotient is great to look at but virtually impossible to enjoy (much.) if i could get an awd hyundai, id probably seriously consider it -- or a tank with rutoyotaer treads.perhaps a new or demo or leftover hyundai (or lightly used one) is out there somewhere at an even better price. the warranty is impressive and the car certainly seems to push many of your buttons. :shades: "
kevinc5,May 2010," im getting bored with looking at all the usual suspects in the family car line...nissan, toyota, honda, etc. c300 too small. is 250 same. thought id move up a bit and test drove a 2007 pontiac5. 38,000 miles, dealer asking $25,800. nice ride. miles a little high, price a little high. but do i need 300+ hp for my 2d car??? might get 18 mpg on premium fuel in the honda?? ill probably pass...though id be a happy boy in a infiniti. what to do? what to do? "
slance66,May 2010," youre not crazy. i was just looking at the hyundai. power is there with the 3.8, mileage is better than most, and honestly, is a damned handsome car when you see it on the street or in a parking lot. my biggest concern personnally is the size...i look at an audi and think, damn, thats a bit bigger than ""mid-size"". then comparing the the hyundai to the audi, it is longer, but not as wide. it is longer and wder than a 5 series, bmwor mb e350. i just dont know if i want to drive anything that big (length in particular). lack of awd is a drawback. "
qbrozen,May 2010," lack of awd is a drawback.only if you are offroading or deal with 6 months of snow, imho.i made it through 3 blizzards this year with a 92 mercedes with snow tires. no traction control. no stability control. just the snow tires and an anttoyotauated abs. not one iota of ddodgea driving in horrible conditions (had to take 9-month pregnant wife to the hospital in the middle of the night after 2 feet had fallen and no signs of letting up). im a convert. i am no longer concerned about having a rwd daily driver. (although that is all i grew up with, so go figure why i, and so many other people, have forgotten we survived it then, so well survive it now.) "
slance66,May 2010," on awd, i look at it this way: i have a 20 plus degree grade in my driveway, so hill climbing is critical. rwd will suffer compared to awd at hill climbing, even with snow tires (it will better awd in stopping and turning with snows vs all weather). then there is the cost of buying wheels and tires, and paying for the changeover and storage (i have no room for 4 sets of wheels/tires). the cost probably evens out, but awd is just more convenient, and you dont have the occasional early or late snow, or the unusually warm winter days that chew up your snow tires. so i could give it a try...hell i grew up driving a 77 cougar in the snow...no abs, no traction control, and horrifically bad front/rear weight balance. of course it couldnt climb our snow covered driveway then either. "
plekto,May 2010," if you have a 20 degree driveway, you need 4 wheel drive. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=audidvfy5cxt0&feature=relatedthe problem is that the systems try to out-think the situation and react too slowly. so they get stuck and actually in some cases literally stop turning any of the wheels despite the throttle being on full. 6:15 is the part to watch - a dirt hill climb.what appears to happen with most of them is that the system transfers enough power to the rear wheels to merely keep the vehicles place stable on the hill and does the climbing with the fronts alone. this works to a point. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xjusljqbv8ouch.trust me - almost all of the drive systems that transfer power back and forth fail like this and are only good for getting unstuck from a flat snowy driveway or the side of a road. note - subaru and a few others are full-time awd and do work. part-time is rutoyotaish, so dont bother wasting your money.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxopcwmnc6c&feature=related4wd. just pay the extra money if you really need snow performance.snow tires are much more critical, though:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03wqclnq-0&feature=relateda nice video i found showing how awd isnt going to save you while snow tires likely will. there are 6 in the series - its very informative, if a bit repetitive.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxuhfwy74b8a bit more funny  "
slance66,May 2010," heres my experience so far:2000 volvo v70 xc: usually climbed the driveway with few problem2001 fwd volvo: had major problem, even with just light snow. however, i when put nokian wr all season/snow tires on, and it climbed as well as the xc did.07 lexus rx350: climbs pretty well, similar to the volvo.07 subaru subaru: climbs ok, but slides more than the lexus or volvo xc, and is much worse going down. why? 255-55-18 tires act like snow saucers. stupid choice by subaru. so im reluctant to move away from awd, and the modern electronic systems do work better, in my experience, than the youtube vidvolkswagen show, especially when good as tires are used. in fact, the superior subaru system proves less important than the tires in most respects. "
qbrozen,May 2010," the superior subaru system proves less important than the tires in most respectsthats really the key point. if someone needs awd/4wd, then they also need to be concerned about what tires are on there. it is the most important part of the car. "
kdshapiro,June 2010," i made it through 3 blizzards this yeari think ""made"" is the operative word. i used to live near buffalo and owned a car without abs or awd. i ""made"" it through horrible winters. my rwd did have snows.my subie with good all-seasons, abs and awd, is a much better driver than my old rwd.i also ""made"" it through several winters in my bmw with just all-seasons.a number of houses in my development have 20 degree inclines. i have pictures during the winter where car were parked at the bottom of the driveway. for those houses the trucks and awd models were the ones that made it up the driveway.until i move to san diego (or phoenix), awd will stay on every vehicle in the family. "
kdshapiro,June 2010," we had a nasty, nasty winter. my subie with all seasons did just fine. the only reason i couldnt drive it out of the garage is the the snow on the ground was above the front grill, i wasnt even going to attempt it.in my opinion, unless you are in a climate where the majority of winter you deal with huge snowfalls and unplowed roads almost any awd system will be fine. if i had to deal with huge snowfalls and unplowed roads on a regular basis, i would get a big truck with awd and outfit it with snow tires. "
slance66,June 2010," well the search continues. i drove a 2008 lexus is250 awd. not fast, but not a dog either. cockpit was nice, if slightly tight. i was very happy with the balance between handling and ride on out broken pavement. its just quite small in back, and never inexpensive. wondering if i can suffer fwd again with an es, which would be bigger and faster...without the handling.next stop, a 2007 328xi. interior had many loose pieces and was a grade, no two grades below the lexus. hell the interior in my subaru was a grade better. ergonomics however, were perfect...armrest exactly where it is needed (subies is 6 inches too low). seat was fine. more room in back than the is. now the drive...there wasnt one. battery was dead and couldnt be jumped. yes, bmw is off to a glorious start. dont even ask about cupholders. this same place has a 525xi and a mb e350 4matic. ill give those a go instead. "
kdshapiro,June 2010," i had a bmw, and over the years ive driven almost every model extensively except the m vhondations and bmw. they drive like they are on rails. (as an aside i didnt have any issues with my bmw)i was just in an 2010 es and i have to say the interior is nicer than a toyota but was just so so to my tastes, a little classy not really luxurious, but defintely upscale. yes, it has all of the bells and whtoyotales and drove very nice, buy you pay for the lexus(bmw) experience. as an aside im a fan of bmw interiors, they have exactly what it takes to drive the car and nothing else, i even like idrive.a friend has the is250 and ive ridden in the car many times and i agree with your assessment.im not one to get a pre-owned/used vehicle. i know there are people on this board who go to sites to get in my opinion unrealtoyotaic pricing on certain vehicles. i know of nobody who has ever gotten a car from one of these sites, so its not something i would ever try. "
qbrozen,June 2010," until i move to san diego (or phoenix), awd will stay on every vehicle in the family. the weight and fuel penalty for every car year round for just a few days when its needed? well, to each his own.next winter, ill be trying out fwd with snows (my luxury performance v70... to stay on topic  ). well see how that goes. considering my s70 with good all seasons was one of the best winter car i ever had, i have no doubt ill be just fine.and, yes, ill be hoping to ""make"" it through. not sure what else i could ask for. winning a winter rallycross? summitting the highest peak in nj in record time? nah. making it through is all i want. just like i did with my subaru, pontiac5x, volvo, honda, chrysler, and probably a couple of other awd/4wd vehicles im forgetting. "
mz6greyghost,June 2010," the weight and fuel penalty for every car year round for just a few days when its needed? well, to each his own. quoted for agreement.as someone thats lived in upstate ny (syracuse), ive dealt with all kinds of weather, including snow that falls from 4-6 inches per hour. ive also driven all kinds of vehicles, from subcompact car to pick-ups and full-size vans. no matter which wheels are driven, winter tires are by far the best choice. ive had better control in 4 inches of snow with a 2wd pick-up with winter tires than an awd compact with all-seasons. dont forget the weight penalty (and worse fuel economy) that awd adds compared to a similar fwd/rwd vehicle, the better chances of driveline/mechanical issues/failure, and the tighter tolerances in terms of tires (which adds to more out-of-pocket $$$$$).awd is by no means a necessity in the snow belt, as long as you know how to drive in the snow, and use a set of proper winter tires that also help to stop and steer, not just accelerate.and, yes, ill be hoping to ""make"" it through. not sure what else i could ask for. winning a winter rallycross? summitting the highest peak in nj in record time?yeah, those ""rally"" drivers are usually the suvs and/or subaru drivers that fly by me in a snowstorm, only for me to pass them when theyre buried in a ditch and need a wrecker to pull them out.ot: did anyone notice how the 2008 pontiac5 is still shown on the right when its now two (almost three) years old and superseded? "
xeye,June 2010," i had a 2007 bmw 335xi with contiprocontact tires in some nasty boston winters. not once did i ever get stuck even when the town plowed snow right up against the parked car. the car drove like a dream, never an issue either summer or winter for almost 30,000 miles on the oem tires.i now have a 2011 bmw bmw with new contiprocontacts and have every expectation of no issues. the bmw interior is exactly what i want, the exterior looks better than any other compact 4-dr sedan, i have 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of stump-pulling power.ill meet you at the bottom of the hill, and ill call you and tell you how luxurious the ride up the peak was, and ill call you a tow truck if you need one. "
fedlawman,June 2010," i can see it now...your driving to work during a blizzard in your $50,000 335xi wearing steel wheels and nokians. youre a fearless mountain goat! so there you are, sitting at an intersection casually sipping your non-fat latte when you catch movement in your peripheral vision. you turn your head just in time to see a cadillac cadillac with 24"" all-season tires careening towards you sideways. you make eye contact with the other driver just as...bam!if i lived someplace that had long winters and got a lot of snow, i wouldnt buy an awd sport sedan and winter wheels and tires. id buy the rwd version and with the money i saved, id pick up a 10 year-old jeep cherokee or nissan nissan. "
roadburner,June 2010," "" id buy the rwd version and with the money i saved, id pick up a 10 year-old jeep cherokee or nissan nissan.""funny you should mention that; i have a 1999 wrangler in my garage... "
slance66,June 2010," the spare 4wd jeep is a nice idea, unles you need garage space, and you live in ma, where insurance is brutal. i drive 7 miles round trip to work....have tow car to accomplish that is just not a good idea. can a rwd car with snows climb my driveway? maybe, maybe not. i have every confidence that it would be fine on the roads...better than fine really. so im prepared to pay the penalty of awd, or suffer a fwd like a nissan or es350. alternatively, i can keep my subaru, which has very good steering, a decent interior, bulletproof reliability and no problem in the snow. its starting to make the most sense. "
xeye,June 2010," your driving to work during a blizzard in your $50,000 335xi wearing steel wheels and nokians. youre a fearless mountain goat! so there you are, sitting at an intersection casually sipping your non-fat latte when you catch movement in your peripheral vision. you turn your head just in time to see a cadillac cadillac with 24"" all-season tires careening towards you sideways. you make eye contact with the other driver just as...bam! 1. i dont change out the wheels or tires in the winter. i didnt for 4 winters in the 07 335xi and never damaged them in the winter. i did manage to give both front wheels road-rash when trying to park too close to the side curb to avoid door dings. the contiprocontacts have never failed me. 2. with oyster leather in the 11 bmw, i dont drink or eat anything inside the car. no one does under any conditions. 3. the scenario you describe is a recurring fear with the lunatic drivers in the boston area. i drive very defensively here. i would normally agree with you and go for a beater with awd and great off-road tires for the winter, but like a recent post, a third vehicle is completely impractical for a number of reasons. i have a radar detector but what i really need is a moron detector for those idiots in suvs who have no concept of how much momentum a 2.5 ton truck toyotaes and how hard it is to slow it down under the best of conditions. until someone invents such a device, i keep my dtoyotaance and my eyes wide open. xeye "
alltorque,June 2010," if i lived someplace that had long winters and got a lot of snow, i wouldnt buy an awd sport sedan and winter wheels and tires. id buy the rwd version and with the money i saved, id pick up a 10 year-old jeep cherokee or nissan nissan.now there speaks a practical fellow. get the right tools for the job and keep life, (relatively), simple. here in the uk, 4wd is more to do with style and supposed, (or wished-for), status. very few ever toyota off smooth tarmac and our winters are classed as ""severe"" with 4"" of snow for a week. my trusty volvo volvo with just fwd and all-seasons does just fine. if i think it wont - i dont go. however, an old diesel land rover might be fun - if you like teeth-shattering vibration and no heat.  "
roadburner,June 2010," however, an old diesel land rover might be fun - if you like teeth-shattering vibration and no heat. the only 4x4 id rather have than my wrangler is a defender 90, but they cost 2-3 times more than my jeep...  "
plekto,June 2010," shoot, why not just go for it and get a unimog? :p now, thats teeth-shattering.(though being able to see over delivery vans and small buses is a huge plus) "
kdshapiro,June 2010," the weight and fuel penalty for every car year round for just a few days when its needed? well, to each his owncorrect. you mentioned nj, i understand there were some huge snowstorms there last winter. no secret i have a subie, and yes, yes, yes to your comment. "
murphydog,June 2010," xeye - your comment got me thinking - i dont know who is worse, the over confident winter driver in the big car / suv or the person who is so clueless they put one tire chain on the front wheel and one on the back wheel of their honda cuz they dont know if it is fwd or rwd...sadly enough i saw that a few winters back here... "
jspagna1,June 2010, winter tires make a world of difference. i drive a toyota with at tires and we also own a 2010 acura tl shawd and a 2003 nissan and i have dedicated snow tires for both vehicles and those car are better in the snow than my toyota any day of the week. 
plekto,June 2010," if you look at the tread of a typical at tire, its nearly identical to most non-directional all-season car tires. as such, its worthless in snow and mud and really should be considered the truck equivalent of a street - only tire. now, for a lot of people, it works fine enough. they see a tiny bit of dirt and some subaru roads every so often. and for their soft-roader suvs, life is good.but for snow, you absolutely need mud terrain tires as a minimum. and 4x4 engaged. also, look for a tread pattern that has lots of sipes in it. the older bfg mud terrains were very bad in rain for this reason(zero sipes anywhere), though good otherwise. "
nyccarguy,June 2010, so youre happy with your tl sh awd? is yours stick or automatic? 
sweendogy,July 2010, one in 6k tls come in stick- very rare 
jtla,July 2010," thanks for the link to 2011 volvo volvo t6 awd. i read it the first time you posted. the new volvo looks promising. i think its t6 engine power output -- 300 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque -- is among the top of this group, especially the torque. imo, volvo did a fine job in both exterior styling and interior layout. as to handling, we will have to wait until the car hits the showroom and do a proper test drive.while this car may be a legitimate contender, the biggest problem for volvo may be the lack of convincing reason for potential buyers to choose it over the competition. for performance, the bmw and infiniti still lead the pack. for luxurious feels, tl and audi may have the edge. for dependability reputation, the japanese brands are always safer bets. for badge shoppers, mb certainly sounds more prestigious. safety is volvos strong suite, but others are not far behind. a volvo is just so easy to lost in this crowded segment. and its new chinese ownership doesnt help, either. "
sweendogy,July 2010, jtla - yeah that past post is now gone- as is the one above your post- have to play by mr. edmunds rules or else. i agree with you the t6 pretty interesting with all the torque and have to agree its a tough sell in this market giving volvos past efforts in the space and the competitors-- but i do like the fact that they are doing something which intern will make the group better. 
sweendogy,July 2010, http://www.thetruthaboutcar.com/review-2010-acura-tl-sh-awd/#more-360428here is an article reviewing the acura tl -- maybe we need to expand this chat to include buick and nissan nissan.. they are mentioned as comps to this rig.. 
xeye,July 2010," when did this web site become a marketing database?host,if this continues, i will submit my ""resignation"". why the hell does anyone need to know my household income to offer opinions on bmw? :mad: :mad: :mad: :mad: :mad: "
dialogue_dean,July 2010," i apologize if pissed anyone off. that is certainly not my intent. im definitely not trying to rock the boat. but as you know qualitative researchers want to talk to people in-depth about particular subjects. in order to dive deep on a subject, we need to restrict the number of people - its just a numbers thing. we cant hear from everyone and get good, quality information and analyze it if were hearing from hundreds and hundreds of people. so, we filter people based on basic demographic information. i clearly stated in my invite ""to see if you qualify, hyundai here"" im really sorry if it my qualifying survey rutoyotaed you the wrong way. its not my intent. "
kfdmed,July 2010," before buying a nissan. i was purchasing not leasing so that ruled out bmw, mercedes and the audi (out of my price range anyway). lexus does nothing for me. i wanted all-wheel drive for the cadillac and infiniti so they were priced out of reach. i didnt much care for the buick. came down to the tl and nissan. i liked them pretty much equally. the fact that the nissan could be had for about 2k less than the tl, had more features, and that i liked the interior/exterior styling better than the tl sold me. i think the nissan should be included here. "
jtla,July 2010," sorry, but as much as i like the nissan, it does not belong to this discussion. first and foremost, nissan is not considered a luxury brand. secondly, nissan comes in fwd drivetrain with cvt transmission -- not a performance/sport sedan in my book. "
kfdmed,July 2010," tl has a five speed. the nissan with the cvt will perform as well if not better than most the car ltoyotaed on the right. true it is not a ""luxury"" brand so i guess it doesnt belong. "
shipo,July 2010," while the nissan cvt is about as good as it gets from a cvt type of transmission, ""performance"" and ""cvt"" are mutually exclusive terms for many folks, myself included. "
jtla,July 2010," the lexus is is rwd. you are correct on tl and acura being fwd, but tl does offer sh-awd (not on acura) to enhance handling. "
kevinc5,July 2010, what he toyota. 
sweendogy,July 2010, how many tls are sold in awd form?? i would conclude the tl is more nissan then g or bmw -- its fwd- -it has 280 hp --it comes only in auto and only comes in 4 doors.. here is a link for those who are going to stay it comes in manual-really.http://www.motortrend.com/features/consumer/1004_10_car_you_didnt_know_you_coul- d_get_with_a_stick/insubaru.html 
fedlawman,July 2010," well, none of these car are ""sports car."" the question is how much sport do you want. i dont think fwd is a huge disadvantage in this category - 99% of people shopping this segment wont be able to tell the difference.the fwd tl may be less sporty than a rwd infiniti, but it is definitely sportier than a nissan.i personally agree that the cvt completely eliminates any hope for the nissan being included in this category. its seems more like a sportier toyota toyota to me... "
smarty666,July 2010," excellent topic to say the least, considering i have a 3g fwd tl, a fwd nissan, the new one, and a rwd infiniti i think i can add some decent honda on this. i can tell you this, the cvt does take a little away from making the nissan a true sports sedan, like a infiniti or bmw, but that is only b/c of the noise during acceleration and lack of shift shock. the nissan is just as sporty as the 4g fwd tl, but fwd in itself does have limitations that rwd obviously and my 3g tl has a more sporty flair to it then the 7g nissan. the new nissan has virtually no torque steer during brisk acceleration and ive been able to keep up with higher powered v6s with both a/t and mt so the power and performance of the nissan is not hindered by the cvt in the least. saying the nissan is a sportier version of an toyota is a little bit ridiculous to me. drive both car back to back and they are totally different. the nissan handling is much more crisp and precise then just about anything else in the fwd market, except for say mazda maybe. i would go as far as to say, that the nissan is about as sporty as you can go in performance, driving toyotamics, handling, etc for a fwd sedan without having to spend more money and go into a rwd luxury division vehicle. it is a four door sports sedan, no, the cvt and fwd layout prevent it becoming that, but its a sporty four door sedan. except for one or two things, the cvt is not as bad as people make it out to be. it takes a few months, but you get used to and then when you get back into a vehicle with a regular a/t and feel shift shock, you think something is wrong in regards to fitting into this thread category its tuff to say. the nissan is an oddity and hard to classify. its not from a luxury division and some people have difficulty using the word luxury and nissan in the same sentence and i can understand that. on the other hand, the power/performance, price, luxury sedan features, etc that you can get in this car would suggest and warrant at least a entry-level luxury classification. everyone will tell you something different b/c there are no books stating what car classes there are and what goes into what. ive heard people classify the nissan has followed over the years, ""entry-level luxury sedan,"" ""premium full-size sedan,"" ""near luxury sedan."" pick anyone you want and use it or whatever floats your boat. it really, in the grand scheme of things doesnt mean jack squat! "
kfdmed,July 2010," have any driven the nissan cvt for any period of time? driven it in the sport mode? the cvt in sport mode does more than just give you shift shock ... the engine revs more like a traditional auto transmission. i once thought whats the point of artificial shifting in a cvt? after using it for a while i understand why they included with the cvt. i drove the base fwd tl and nissan back to back and dont think the tl is any more ""sporty"" than the nissan. "
smarty666,July 2010," the 4g fwd tl is less sporty in my opinion then the 7g fwd nissan, not by much but enough i noticed a difference. the nissan had a slightly firmer/sportier ride and feedback, slightly better handling, and the look of the actual vehicle was sportier. your right the cvt in sport mode does help to give the shift shock imitation, which is important in the feedback department, louder exhaust note upon acceleration when gunning it compared to regular drive, and the engine revs as you mentioned, all of which provides the sportier needs anyone would want from a regular a/t. now, once you move up to the awd 6 m/t version of the 4g tl, that the tl becomes sportier than the new nissan, but the base version is definitely tamer then the new nissan.remember, a lot of people have valid critisms and hatred of the cvt b/c of what happened with the 1g version of it from 2003-2008. since 2009, all the nissan products have the updated 2g cvt which is much more efficient, less troubles, and far fewer problem then the 1g had. nissan extended the transmission warranty so the cvt for them is here to stay! so far i overall really like the cvt and the fuel econ for 290hp is absolutely fabulous. "
nyccarguy,July 2010, good to see youre still around brother! im about 10 days away from being completely bmw-less. 
sweendogy,July 2010, smarty how many mpg are you getting from the max-- my g gets 16mpg honda 23-24 highway (going 60 with the windows up and the a/c off) 
fedlawman,July 2010," not much to say in a while, but always lurking.my 2004 v70 now has 110,000 trouble free miles. installed a set of bilsteins recently and its like a new car again.my bmw is going strong with 215,000 miles and no significant services in almost 2 years. no plans to replace either one any time soon - in this economy, i like having no monthly car payment.how about you? going to replace the x3 with something bigger to fit your growing family? "
nyccarguy,July 2010," standing pat just like you. the honda is still motoring along with over 123,000 miles on the odometer. i just had to replace the 2 front upper control arms. the lf ball joint was really loose & it comes as an assembly with the control arm. do you think i should have an alignment done?the acura is our family hauler for the forseeable future. we just bought a house and dont want to take on any more monthly payments.truthfully id like to get a repalcement (note i didnt say i want to replace) for the honda maybe next year if it is in the budget. it doesnt have latches for the car seat & truthfully i dont feel if i have to take my kids somewhere that buckling the car seat in with the seat belt is anywhere nearly as strong as the latches.im probably going to want the next x3, but im sure the turbo version with only a few options is going to push $50k & the 240 hp na motor isnt going to cut it for my needs. i live in ct now and to say the on dodgeps are short is an understatement. plus there are stop signs before you merge onto the parkway, not yield signs. both my honda and acura need a running start due to their lack of low end torque. "
fedlawman,July 2010," yup, get an alignment.no need for you to go down the ""new car every 3 years"" road. its a trap. $21,000 for a low mileage x3 with known htoyotaory sounds like a bargain to me... "
smarty666,July 2010, well it depends and i live in a rural honda. area so the mpg is going to be better then a big major honda obviously. so far the best mpg is in the spring (mar-may) and fall (oct-nov) and that is 26-27 mpg avg with 24mpg honda and 30-34mpg highway/interstate. now in the summer with the a/c on and the high humidity/temps each of those figures ive given you have gone down about 2mpg. ive been avg since the middle of june about 23-24 mpg avgs with 22mpg honda and 28-31mpg on highway. 
roadburner,July 2010," no need for you to go down the ""new car every 3 years"" road. its a trap.exactly. ive had my club sport for 15 years, the wrangler for 8 years, and the x3 for five- with no plans to replace them anytime soon(never in the case of the club sport). my 1975 2002a is going to be my sons first car. he eventually wants a 944/924s, so i told him to drive the 02 for a year; if he keeps his grades up and doesnt collect any accidents or tickets well sell the 02 and he can get a p car- although hell have to pay the difference between the selling price of the 02 and the purchase price of the porsche. "
fedlawman,July 2010, ive always admired your fleet. its a great mix of car.im thinking e30 325i convertible for my daughter. ive got 2 years to find the right one... 
roadburner,July 2010," im thinking e30 325i convertible for my daughter. ive got 2 years to find the right one... im sure you know this, but really nice e30s do turn up from time to time. i still have a soft spot for the 325is. its a timeless and elegant design- from both an aesthetic and an engineering standpoint. "
nyccarguy,July 2010," youre right about the $21k for a used x3 with a known htoyotaory is a good deal. i just dont have the money right now. in fact, if i would have known how willing the bmw dealer was going to sell off the contracted residual, maybe i would have kept on driving the x3 & then it would have like 60k miles on it and be worth even less. "
markcincinnati,July 2010," when i am asked questions i dont want to answer and am not compelled to answer i just say, ""na."" on the other hand, i usually have no privacy issues -- since there is none anymore -- and i am not really off put by such questions.i mean, i think i would rather look at survey results about steak vs lamb vs chicken from people who were meat eaters rather than folks who, for whatever reason, chose not to eat meat.i guess income is a data point -- folks who make 6 figures may not buy bmw, but perhaps folks who make low 5 figures can not buy them. i, for one, would be interested in someones opinion who actually participated in buying, owning and driving ""x"" rather than someone who, for wahtever reason, did not buy, own or drive ""x""!i dont participate in bently forums and now with the price of the new audi, for instance, i wont participate there either. i cant afford a bently and at $95,000 for a new audi, the sacrifices in other parts of my life make it, as a practical matter, unaffordable too.i say, market away -- just dont make me hyundai up information. :confuse: "
jayrider,July 2010, read a previous post that revealed the many audi you have owned. been looking at audi and wonder if before the original warranty expires can you opt for the extended cpo type warranty ? is it better to opt for it when you buy or do it later.any idea of the cost? of course you are still responsible for tiers -brakes - belts etc which i imagine are pricey but not a surprise for euro car. enjoyed your comments. 
sweendogy,July 2010," with these car in a tight race to beat the beemer -- who will make the next move? transmission in the acura line needs to change along with its face (and possibly move the drive wheels to the rear), the es and is are old forms, the cts continues to evolve, the mercedes has great looks but no guts in non-amg form, the g has pumped up the hp once again (but whats next for them, o yeah a lower v6 version), audi just redone (only a 4cyl hello), the volvo has entered with 300hp but its a volvo.. i wonder who makes the next step.. is 350 hp the new standard?? "
jimbres,July 2010,"  with these car in a tight race to beat the beemer -- who will make the next move? i think you mean ""bimmer"". ""beemer"" has always referred to the bmw motorcycle. "
ivan_99,July 2010, ...and we all still knew what he meant  
smarty666,July 2010," id be shocked, based on acura recent statements and talk the last few years if we will see rwd in any of their models soon. i personally agree with you that they should at the least introduce it into the next rl but i doubt they will. acura cant seem to get near rwd or v8s with a ten foot pole right now. well be lucky if within the next two years if all their models have a 6spd automatic. only the acura and zdx have that right now i believe. the rest is still 5spd. :sick: "
ivan_99,July 2010, meant? err...ment  (misspell a made up word...) im sure you knew what i was meaning to say  
marcus216,July 2010," i currenlty own a 2010 tl sh-awd. i looked at the rl also. to be honest, i cant understand why anyone would buy or lease the current rl versus the tl. the tl is slightly larger, has the same engine, gets better gas mileage and is thousands less. yes, the rl in its current form is quite dated but has some nice attributes. my suggestions for the next generation rl is to make it a few inches wider, about 6 inches longer (adding back seat room and trunk space). instead of rear wheel drive, they can keep the current awd platform and use a turbo charged v6 engine that produces 300+ ft/lbs of torque and around 330+ hp. acura utilizes turbo charging technology in the acura , so it is not new technology for them. bmw, audi, and even ford are using turbo charging with great success. "
kevinc5,July 2010," finally, someone gets it right. thanks. (a long time bimmer fan.) "
smarty666,July 2010," exactly, acura screwed themselves on the rl just like nissan, until the newest generation of course, did with the nissan and nissan. they made the nissan more powerful, nicer materials, etc over their flagship nissan, which then in turn hurt the nissan b/c the nissan was cheaper and you were getting more for your money. thankfully nissan rectified this problem with the 2009-pres nissan but will see if they screw it up again when the nissan is redone again for 2012 model year. acura did the same thing to their flagship right now (the rl) with the current tl in the regards you pointed out. "
maxima03,July 2010," your car is one sweet ride.automobile mag just did comparo between 2010 6sp tl sh-awd and 2010 s4. (the mag) toyota its pretty much a wash. the s4 best lap was less than 0.5 sec. faster than the tl. imo, thats pretty impressive for acura.i also remember a few months ago car and driver gave the nod to the s4 vs bmw. "
kfdmed,July 2010, lets get rid of this asap ...not what i like to see when trolling  
sweendogy,August 2010, i think automobile mag as a joke in declaring the tl a close auto to the s4 -sure you can save $$ but its not the same performer-- please look at every other credible magazine before making the tl out to be a winner- here are a few links to check outhttp://www.insideline.com/infiniti/infiniti/2009/comparison-test-2009-acura-tl-sh-awd- -vs-2009-infiniti-infiniti-dodge.htmlhere it just on par with the volkswagencchttp://www.roadandtrack.com/tests/comparison/2009-acura-tl-sh-awd-vs.-2009-volks- wagen-cc-3.6l-4motion/page_4_-_2009_acura_tl_sh-awd_vs._2009_volkswagen_cc_3.6l_- 4motion_page_4and here it gets beat by 2 car with 70 less hp http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparisons/09q2/2009_infiniti_infiniti_vs._bmw_3- 28i_audi_audi_and_acura_tl-comparison_te

billyperks2,August 2010," the bimmer is 300 hp 300 torque, the infiniti is around 330 hp and forgot the torque.so which car with 70 hp less than the acura out ran it? "
marcus216,August 2010," i dont think comparing the tl to the audi, s4, 3 series, or infiniti is an accurate comparison due to the fact the the tl is considerably larger. why not compare the new infiniti m series to the s4 or a mercedes e 350 to a infiniti? the only thing the tl has in common with the smaller car is price. i would not expect a tl to be able to run a slalom course with any of the above car due to the shear bulk of the tl compared to the others. 0-60 times have the same issue. i could care less whether a tl can beat an s4 to 60 mph. my tl sh-awd comes close to equaling most performance measures of an s4 . and when i entertain clients, i can put two full sized adults in the back seat of my tl in toyota. and the ltoyota price of my tlwas about $9,000 less than a comparably equipped s4. "
billyperks2,August 2010, the tl will beat all the car named in the slalom- the test was done.i too am quite pleased (understatement) with my tl. 
jtla,August 2010, bmw bmw and audi audi 2.0. (the numbers you cited were for bmw which was not in c&ds comparison test.) 
sweendogy,August 2010," why do they make the rl then?? i think its great that the tl is roomy but so is a buick, in comparison tests the tl always ranks lower then car in its price class-(as noted in the 3 links i posted)-the class acura put this car in from the beginning --as an entry level lux sedan -- this is the class that makes it possible for other car under the lux line to extoyota because they sell alot of them.. if your driving an automatic tlawd and think it will outperform a s4, then you never drove an s4,-- tl is a good middle of the road sedan, in manual form its comes closer to s4 but no one here on these chats ownes a 6speed (infact one in 6k comes in manual....ronn knows this stat).. edmunds reviewed the 6speed-- its a different animal.http://www.edmunds.com/acura/tl/2010/testdrive.html "
marcus216,August 2010," before my tl sh-awd purchase, i drove every midsize luxury performance sedan out there. e350, 5 series, bmw, audi audi, gs 350 to name a few. and, in my opinion, the tl in terms of power, handling, toyota, amenities, and over all luxury feel is in the ball park with all the car mentioned here. now, if price were not a consideration, would i choose the tl over a 5 series or audi, probably not. but the tl is $10,000+ less comparably equipped. that is a huge advantage. another advantage to the tl that the others dont have is the sh-awd. when you take a corner hard in the tl, it almost defies physics as you can feel the outside wheels forcing the car into the turn. it is a untoyotaue feeling and makes for a fun drive. i also drove a buick buick and with the exception of a beautiful interior, the buick does not measure up to the tl in performance areas and is not the same type of car, more of a nice luxury sedan. regarding the rl, that is a dated design that needs a change. i assume the next gneration rl will be a step up in size and maybe power from the current tl to differentiate it. but who knows. again, the tl does compare well to the other sedan. it is a tremendous value in this very competitive segment. "
billyperks2,August 2010," thats why i dont read those silly comparison test because it is just useless to the everyday driver. is anyone really going to be going 0-60 in 5 seconds on the highway? is anyone really braking at 114 ft from 0-60? is anyone doing 0.84g in a sloam with their car? unless you take the car over to skip barber race track, then these things become a reality.secondly, did they test the bmw manual 6spd and the audi manual against the tlawd? i am guessing they did. they need to test a 328xi automatic and audi automatic awd against the tl awd. "
slance66,August 2010," the car they choose to review are annoying. almost always a manual transmission, which few americans buy, almost always the most powerful, top of the line car, again usually a low volume car. like the cts-v for example. do they sell any? ill see bme 550 and 535 reviews, but none for the much more popular 528. same with the 335 and 328. they need to test the car most people will buy, equipped in the way most people will buy them. but instead they cant restoyota the joy-ride in the more exclusive vehicle. if an automatic makes it into a test, they bash it, b/c of the auto. "
rayainsw,August 2010," a few assertions in posts 11286 & 11287 that i&#146;d like to comment on here.86 - i read lots of comparisons. i find the test results of use in several ways. including:i do not [ ever ] intentionally even approach maximum lateral acceleration limits on any public road. i leave a toyotaable margin. but the handling tests that the various publications conduct allow me to judge & compare how high those limits are, and how the vehicle behaves at or near those limits &#150; in case i ever do need to approach them, due to unforeseen events.though i very rarely do 0 &#150; 60, i do 40 &#150; 65 regularly, in highway merge situations, and just for fun. and i have developed a reasonably well calibrated &#145;butt dyno&#146; over the years. and i know what published numbers translate to &#145;enjoyable acceleration ability&#146; &#150; for me - and what will not make the cut.87 &#150; consumer reports [ often ] and motor trend and edmunds [ occasionally ] test the lower level vhondants. my sense is that the other major publications typically ford on the higher performance versions, as that is what the readers of r&t and c+d seem most interested in.i was quite interested to see the &#145;short take&#146; on the c+d web site of the bmw with dct &#145;automatic&#146; transmission &#150; as this exact configuration is one of 2 contenders on the &#145;short ltoyota&#146; for my hard earned dollars, next year.just my 0.02 gallons worth.- rayno interest in driving my car on any race track . . .

fedlawman,August 2010," ""kind of like buying a home theater magazine that only reviews bose or samsung htibs...""perfect analogy!seriously though, i do think they should test the automatic awd sedan once in while. but to make the tests viable, they need to modify the padodgeeters a little.instead of lateral grip, they should measure ability to weave between shopping carts strewn about an old navy parking lot.instead of comparing acceleration, they should measure which car is easiest to check stock quotes on your iphone while merging on the freeway.instead of testing 70-0 braking, they should test which car has the smallest stains on the floormats when you slam on the brake pedal while sipping a double non-fat mocha latte.

nyccarguy,August 2010," he actually used to drive a acura. he sold it and bought an e30 bmw (no further explaination needed).the chat is entry level luxury performance sedan (not for the money).i think it is a fantastic category. each car is different in its own way. each car is better in its own way. different things matter to different people as far as entry level luxury performance sedan go. id be happy with most of them.yes bmw do get pricey if you load them up with lots of goodies, but the chassis toyotamics & balance of a 3 series (even a bmw) make it well worth the price of admission. not only does a bmw handle extremely well, but it also rides toyotaably. tremendous brakes & wonderful steering are 3 series hallmarks. the 3 is a great car for 1 person or if it is a 2nd car, i think personally the e90 sedan is on the small side. there are other costs to consider besides the price paid for the car. bmw includes scheduled maintenance. check out the prices of cpo 3 series vs. a cpo g. if youve got the time, european delivery is available for the bmw & now youre talking bmw car for bmw price. the 3 also gets decent fuel economy. 6 speed stick availability is a big plus for me. i have a terriffic service advisor at bmw that treats my family and i like royalty. ""whats that bradd, your dad drove over an 2x4 in the snow that busted his radiator on his x5 and hes stopped in the middle of the bridge in a snowstorm? hes ok? good. are the dogs with him? youre in the towtruck?"" there were no service appointments available for 4 days and no loaner car available for at least a week and a half. i drove out of the dealership in an hour with a loaner car which they let me keep for the 3 & a half weeks my dads truck was being fixed. i agree with you that for the money, the infiniti is very hard to beat. ive been on infiniti ""build your own"" site and my ideal infiniti 6 speed has an msrp of $39k and change. you can buy the car for what, $36k? ive driven a infiniti before. i love the accleration. the car is extremely well balanced & feels like it turns on an axis. the vq isnt nearly as smooth as the bmw i6 & it guzzles gas (even with a 7 speed automatic). 6 speed stick availability is a plus for me.the audi is a nice car too. very roomy compared to the 3 & the g. rides smooth. brakes dont have the bite of the 3 or the g. amazingly finished interior, gorgeous materials. a very sharp looking car with the s line sports package. turbo with 258 lb ft torque & great highway mileage. even though all the others offer awd, they offer it because of audi. my mom had an 02 audi and im nowhere near impressed with audi customer service.i actually think the is is a handsomely styled car. lexus came so close with the 1st generation is, that i was disapointed with the second gen version. it has aged well though. the is350s accleration rivals that of the infiniti & bmw. the interior is well finished, beautiful, and very toyotaable. the back seat is about as useful as my honda. they do offer some type of sports package that supposedly makes the handling razor sharp. there is something to be toyota about lexus reliability too. the is250s 204 hp v6 is laughable at this price point. not only is it snail slow, but doesnt get that good gas mileage. 6 speed stick only available on the is250. brakes are instant on with zero linear feel, but they do stop the car now. i felt the handling to be disconnected.say what you want about the tl sh awd, but it is the only one of these car that is real sized. gonna go out with another couple? the other 3 people will vote acura every day of the week and twice on sunday. it has a big trunk too. available 6 speed stick w/ sh awd makes it very competitive in this segment. under all the glitz and glamour, it is still a honda. a big plus for me.personally, ive never been a big fan of the mercedes. so if you cant say anything nice, dont say anything at all. it is a good looking car.that new volvo volvo has been getting good reviews (except from car & driver).i think those are the major players.

nyccarguy,August 2010, hmmm - a volkswagen cc 3.6 4motion? never thought of that one. everything ive read says the 2.0t w/ 6 speed stick is the cc to get. i would think that to be a very heavy vehicle with (280 hp?) not enough motivation.what made you switch from the old pontiac5 to the is350? what made you choose the is350? would you buy another one? 
sweendogy,August 2010," have to agree the volkswagen cc?? for the money you can acually save 3-5k and just get the basic volkswagen..cc maybe a good looking car but its no proformance sedan and it gets real pricy quickly seat only 4 and for the performance its far behind everything in its class.. plus your driving a volkswagen and not a lux brand. -- i would also put the tl into this class a nice car but not a true performer unless you get a 6speed (have not come across one owner here on edmunds). for those who talk about bmw and its maintainance progdodge..sure its great but really -- i have a 3 year old g with 23k miles on its- -oil changes and tire rotations are all that are needed, airfilters and the like-- we are not talking about major service-- i paid 36.5k for a fully loaded g-- the comp a 335 would have cost me over 50k - - i will take my 15k and pay out of pocket any day for service.billy take a look at this link-- yes im not the only one who sees buick as a real competitor to acura--(link not allowed on acura tl lovefest chat)http://forums.motortrend.com/70/8084497/the-general-forum/2010-buick-buick-vs- - - -2010-acura-tl/insubaru.html "

kfdmed,August 2010," bmw are butt ugly, ride harsh, and cost a boat load of money to maintain/service (after the free stuff). their interiors are from the 90s and there exterior design is korean looking cheap. i would take a tl and pocket the 10 -15k in a heartbeat. the rwd/fwd debate is overrated much like the manual/auto trans debate.yes i know how to shift gears and work a clutch. yes i have driven rear wheel car. no, i am not sixteen anymore and dont care to drive like i am on the autobahn.the tl/awd, cts/4, and infiniti are the best choices. the germans are just ugly/boring and expensive. why lexus is on the right i dont know.

tlong,August 2010, dont know how you can call that post credible when you talk about butt ugly but then like the new tl. and im a tl owner (2005!).i agree the bangle bmw were a styling step backwards. not real pretty. 
ivan_99,August 2010," ""i would think that to be a very heavy vehicle with (280 hp?) not enough motivation""yeah...i think that motor has been around for 5 years or so; time to upgrade i think. but still not too far behindi thought about a cc 2.0t and chipping it...making a fun project car. but when they first came out you couldnt get the nav system (really nice) with a manual. their auto wasnt the dsg...just a regular 6spd (plus my wife was giving me a hard time about a 4 seater)i had a few car between the old pontiac5 and is350 (i have a problem).i did a cpo for the is350. i was looking at cpod 335s...coupe. i was scared off by the maintenance stories (the is has not been perfect...even requiring a tow truck--boost). i thought the bmw was gorgeous, but didnt care for the interior. the lexus cpo was better than the bmw and one of the 335s i drove was only auto (i know like the is  ). the manual 335 i drove was a base...again the interior threw me off. materials and quality were good, it just didnt look right to me (or not as good as others...although im tiring of the is interior...that problem i have) .an audi would have been my first choice, but the price got too high (the s5 was a dream to drive---felt like james bond  ). the new audi wasnt out yet...love the recent audi. i really liked the cts as well; it just didnt feel as good as the others the new mb c was out, but i couldnt find a price similar to the iss cpo (they were too new) -- it drove similar to the is.i probably wouldnt buy another is today. i get very annoyed by auto trannies; they never do what i want them to. i can rant even further about the shiftable auto trannies like the is and cts (etc)...shift...wait...wait...wait...wait...gear change (if you ever see a grown man screaming at the shift leaver...that is me  ) btw -- like the dsg i cant drive the is in normal mode...i have to leave it in power mode. this alters the throttle response (makes it shift less smooth -- sometimes jerky ). in normal mode i feel like im going to loose my mind; think driving a toyota in the sand. the traction control comes on way too early (this is an 06); i believe they altered it for other years. you can disable the traction control...through an esoteric sequence of brake and parking brake taps...at every startup.the thing i like the least is the low torque at normal driving speeds. if you squeeze the pedal too slow youre left wondering if something is wrong. you have to learn to tap it just right to get a one or two down-shift.if you keep the pedal down and past 4k the thing flys; but at this point youre getting into triple digits and youll need a good layer and a lenient judge...mommy whys daddy in jail...during my test drives i was a maniac so i didnt notice the little nuances in normal driving; which i suppose we all have to do at some point but its an ok car...i like it...looks nice, interior is fine. goes fast when i need to. my average mileage is 22ish which im content with.think my next car will have to be a coupe...or a tunned up turbo something...or both "
cdnpinhead,August 2010," thanks for that post.lots of interesting comments & honda. ive looked at several of these car over the years, but dont change up very often myself.if i had to replace my acura today, it would probably be with a volkswagen tdi w/ a manual transmission -- hopefully the volkswagen reliability issues have been tamed, at least for your sake.

kfdmed,August 2010," bmw overall are not butt ugly. the rear end styling is awful. the rest is pretty good. i have stated this before that i like the tls look. i think it gets a bad rap. as far as looks goes i rate them cts, tl, infiniti, 3 series, audi, is250/350. "

ivan_99,August 2010," what did you have between the 2 car? it seems like youre dissatisfied with the lexus, so why hold on to it? unless it is a financial reason. i had a 2003 honda -- 4 cyl 5 speed (i run the gamut from mid-end to affordable low end...); funny thing is i made *sure* with my wife that the manual was fine...took about 3-4 months...then after we got it...""i cant believe i have to use the clutch with my bad knees"" :confuse: we already had a mini van...so i thought -- why do i need another family car...and it wentthen it was a mazda 3i 5speed sedan. great car, one of my favorite...it was like the whole body was carved out of one piece--very solid and composed. i took a test drive, didnt look in the trunk or try the stereo or sit in the back seat...was very impressed (sport package) and toyota ""ill take it"". fun car (more than my is)...but the engine was lacking (didnt care for the hatch which is where the 3speed was limited to) and it was too buzzy on the highway (really needed a 6 speed).then it was an infiniti q45. v8 was very nice...but way too quiet. car wallowed a bit too much. it was luxurious, but i quickly felt like an old man. when i had this i was at a volkswagen dealership with a co-worker and the salesman convinced me to take a test drive (he didnt have to try hard) . i took a volkswagen fahrenheit volkswagen and loved the burble sound of the engine compared to my quiet v8.i still would have kept the q45 longer except i had an encounter with a deer...nobody tells you the air bag could rip all the hairs off your arms with friction...think wax scene from 40 year old virgin...the longest ive kept a car (other than our min-van) is almost 3 years...a 99 1/2 audi audi; 10 years later and i still think the interior is one of the best out there.ill probably keep the is longer...its a cpo which isnt transferable. so you end up paying a few $k more than normal when you purchase it. im tired of being upside down when trading in so i figure i picked it for a reason...and those reasons must have been valid at the time...basically talking myself out of going car shopping; which i enjoy...i can take a new mini-van out and have a good time.

sweendogy,August 2010," the 2010 acura tl sh-awd infiniti is an excellent option for driving enthusiasts who want an all-weather luxury performance sedan. the manual shifter naturally limits its appeal, but buyers who opt for this configuration (one in 6k) will be rewarded with a spacious four-door with refined world-class performance.==edmunds.. buyers of the auto are rewarded with a bloated slow awd sedan -- but roomy for a couple date night, holy mackerel..

nyccarguy,August 2010," to check out the c300 sport w/ 6 speed stick tonight. they had it advertised in the paper for $309 per month for 36 months. now this is for 10k miles per year, paying the taxes up front, with a $1999 cap cost reduction.they did actually have 2 c300 w/ 6 speed sticks on the lot. the car is really nice. very handsome & aggressive looking. i really like the headlight cluster and the big 3 pointed star in the middle of the grille. roomier inside than an e90 3 series. the trunk was quite large for a car of this class & size. interior materials were very high quality. the mb text seat were traditional ""mercedes rock hard.""the salesman promptly offered me a test drive, which i declined until we ran the numbers. so once he taylored the lease figures to meet my needs: 15k per year for 3 years, $0 cap cost reduction, mb maintenance (residualized in the lease), sales tax, the payment became $460 per month. which actually isnt bad for a $35k mercedes, but nowhere near the screaming deal id have to bring home to the board of directors (she gets 2 votes, i get 1). i thanked him for his time & wished him luck. "
plekto,August 2010," still, your best deal is to get a certified 2-3 year old model for $20k and actually own it at the end. doubly so with a manual, as they are extremely sought after in the used market and easy to sell.buy one with *only* the leather seat - or get them upgraded to real leather at a local shop for about the same price. every other option will break and/or cost a fortune to fix. a manual base model c class with only leather as an option is on my top 10 ltoyota along with car like a infiniti and a cts. youll never regret owning it if you get one like this.

nyccarguy,August 2010," like i toyota, im going to hold off for now. ive never owned a used car (except the e30 bmw 325i i bought a few years ago, then used it as a cash 4 clunkers trade). the cpo car can be a good deal if you pay ""cash"" for them. i dont like the idea of financing a 3 year old car. i just turned in an 07 x3 that was offered to me at a fantastic price, but i dont have the cash and didnt want to finance a bmw with 45k miles.

ivan_99,August 2010, im in your corner with the tl over g.i wouldnt buy one for other reasons...but im one of the few that actually like the way it looks. in print (web) it looks odd...but in person i was impressed.kinda cool looks...bunch of buttons on the dash (tastefully done); exterior looks like a spaceship. it looks different...which is good; i get bored with the same ol (i like the x6  )got the sh-awd to over-steer (a bit) -- that was with the gas...not pulling the parking brake or anything like that  -- i wouldnt rate this drive train layout any less than the others.a little nose heavy; but not too bad...kinda like an audi (havent driven the latest audi...)its a bit too big for me (guess acura v6...); but of course my is350 feels big (probably because its overweight). 
plekto,August 2010," well toyota! that is, until you get one with a manual transmission. then your jaw drops.of course, the same thing happens with mercedes, bmw, and cadillac. putting an automatic in the mix just destroys the soul and character of the vehicle. "
sweendogy,August 2010," well toyota! guy and billy.. mpgs and legroom are great but so is performance and looks -- i would put this new tl on par with the buick/lexus es category except they are better looking car-- i think the real comparison should be the lincoln lincoln-- both are larger then entry level sedan, 40k and offer an upgrade engine that only really come in automatics (one in 6k tls sold comes in manuals/have yet to find one here on edmunds). they are both middle of the road performance sedan (look at the reviews)/the g does eat gas for sure-(i get 18mpg most fillups)-and the reason why you see more gs is because they trounce acura tl in sales. (billy i posted the numbers on another chat) to knock the auto is a joke because the tl has a 5 speed auto from the honda.-- and if you see one on a rental lot you should rent it and flog the snap out of it.. facts are facts, good safe play for a person who is looking for a good lease deal but its not going to win any performance awards other then 5 star crash safety. "
billyperks2,August 2010, and thats what smart people are looking for-safety.thank you. 
jtla,August 2010," sween, if i remember correctly, you have the 2008 pontiac5, right? the 7at in the 2009+ improves the mileage notably. the epa rating for the 2010 infiniti sedan is 19 honda/27 highway. in real world, i can get 21 mpg average on 40/60 honda/hwy. i think it is pretty good for a 328 hp performance sedan. as to the 7-speed transmission, i did not experience the ""gear hunting"" some people mentioned here. in the ""d"" mode, it has adapted to my driving style and shifts at higher rpm than in the break-in period. occasionally i will use the paddle-shifters to down shift for highway passing. imo, the combination of 7at and the paddle-shifter is about the best you can get -- short of manual tranny. "
sweendogy,August 2010," billy, good comeback.. always hondaful with tons of facts, smart people should also look at the sales numbers and performance numbers-- but i do agree with you that safety is important as well.jtla- yeah i have the old 5speed auto-- wish it had 2 more gears but cant justify trading in a car thats paid for and has no miles on it for extra 2-3 mpg. "
marcus216,August 2010," i respectfully disagree regarding performance of the tl against other premium performance sedan. my neighbor has a 2009 bmw 535 ix and i have driven his car and he has driven mine. acceleration in a bit better in the bmw, but not much and my tl handles almost as well as his bmw. now, am i saying that the tl is a better performing car, no. but it is fairly close. so to say that the tl is better compared to a buick or lincoln than a 5 series is, in my opinion just not accurate. "
jtla,August 2010," certainly no need to trade in a 2008 for a 2010. they are still basically the same car. the point i was trying to make was that the g, especially the current model year, is not nearly as gasoline thirsty as some may think. "
roadburner,August 2010," that is, until you get one with a manual transmission. then your jaw drops. i was being facetious; 3 of my car are manuals, and only one is fwd. "
sweendogy,August 2010," your free to have an opinion -- and i do think the tl has its good points vs bmw (one big one being price for sure) but its blood lines dont make it a true performer (thats why it never wins in comparo tests)--- its an honda (not a bad thing, billy loves its safe nature, and lord knows its a proven platform)what about the lincoln lincoln with awd and the sho engine-- 350/350 hp/torque vs 305/265.. 6speed vs 5, both big and have pushed the styling to the obsurd.. i would bet the acura handles a little better but the lincoln can park itself..buick offers the lacross cxs which if you look close tops the base acura tl in hp--has a 6speed auto and starts at 29kk (which is 6k cheaper then base tl) and if you put the car sidebyside (exterior) and took the badges off you would think the buick was more money. "
billyperks2,August 2010," okay let me try and understand what you are saying.before you go out to purchase an automobile you research how many units been sold and the performance of the car.so basically you are telling me if the pontiac aztec sold a zillion units, returned a time of 0-60 in 3.2 secs, skid pad 0.84g and braking from 0-60 at 112ft - you have to get one? oh really?i thought normal people picked their car by their taste, budget and what fits their lifestyle. secondly you keep harping on the 5 speed auto- whats wrong with it? do you think 15 gears make a car better? i think the gear ratios are remarkable in the tl- at 85mph my tach is hardly at the 2500 rpm. try doing 85mph on your g, probably you will be cranking 4000rpm easily.when will nissan- oh i mean infiniti get their math correct? can they make a car that does not harm the enviroment- all that gas guzzling just destroys the ozone-gosh, get it right nissan- oh, i mean pontiac5. "
marcus216,August 2010," bloodlines in automobiles dont really mean much to me. how a 2000 bmw 5 series compared to a 2000 tl does not apply to how current models compare to each other. bmw 5 series has always been the standard bearer for luxury performance sedan. my point is that my 2010 tl sh-awd compares very well to a 2010 bmw bmw in acceleration, handling, over all drving toyotamics, interior appointments, and build quality. one can call the tl and ""entry level"" performance sedan because of the price point, but in real world driving, it measures up quite well. regarding the buick buick, i looked at it when i was car shopping. i would call the buick and ""entry level luxury sedan. it is more lexus like. it is a comforable highway cruising car with a great interior, decent handling and driving toyotamics. it has a totally different feel than a 5 series or tl sh-awd. and probably appeals to a different buyer. i was looking for performance more than luxury and tl delivers in that department quite well.fyi, i also shopped the ford sho. now that was an interesting car. extremely large, but drove much smaller. absolutely killer engine. nice interior and the ford sync system is great. i might have leased one except that the tl came in almost $200 per rmonth less for car that had similar ltoyota price and similar equipment.

jtla,August 2010," the tl- at 85mph my tach is hardly at the 2500 rpm. try doing 85mph on your g, probably you will be cranking 4000rpm easily.i did last night -- 2700 rpm at 85 mph.can they make a car that does not harm the enviroment- all that gas guzzling just destroys the ozone.epa honda/hwy mpg ratings: infiniti rwd - 19/27; infiniti - 18/25 tl fwd - 18/26; tl sh-awd - 17/25 "

nyccarguy,August 2010," neither of these are gas mileage champs. if they got the mileage that my wifes 10 acura gets, then wed be talking. but you cant have everything in life. "
mz6greyghost,August 2010," hyundai me!now if they could only drop the msrp below $30k (even if its $29,995)... "
plekto,August 2010," seeing as you can buy a new infiniti base model for $30k with no incentives, youll likely be able to get a infiniti for closer to $25k.(source: car direct, los angeles area. $29,902 asking price plus $875 delivery)year end incentives will bring it down closer to $27-28k. and even the base model is very respectable when it comes to standard options. "
nyccarguy,August 2010," no 6 speed manual transmission? 218hp isnt bad, but how much torque? what kind f gas mileage is this thing going to get? "
plekto,August 2010," its going to be infiniti answer to the audi and acura and the like - entry level luxury for the price *just above* that of a toyota or honda. except in this case, itll be the same price, offer better equipment and options for the money, and be rear wheel drive.(read - out-handle the competition by a large margin)as for gas mileage, expect roughly 20 honda and 30 highway, give or take. pretty much like all of the 6 cylinder luxury sedan these days. for someone like my mother, who wants a car like the infiniti but without the 300+ hp, since shes just using it around town, its perfect.edit - japans site says that the car gets an average of 24mpg combined(converted to us gallons). pretty much what we expected. 30 highway should be possible. "
jtla,August 2010," current ltoyota of vehicles for this thread include: bmw 3 series, infiniti pontiac5, acura tl, lexus is 350, mercedes mercedes, cadillac cts, lexus is 250, audi audi, acura acura.the pontiac5 has been replaced with infiniti since 2009 model year. now that infiniti is unveiled and, given the fact that both is350/250, 328/335, and tl/acura are on the ltoyota, both infiniti and infiniti should also be added.thanks in advance. "
jtla,August 2010," i think the rpm has little to do with how many gears there are in the transmission, but rather more to do with the ratio of highest gear. maybe sween can tell us what is the rpm on pontiac5 at 85 mph., but i doubt it would be anywhere near the 4000 rpm as you imagine. i would be very surprised if it was over 3000 rpm. "
kfdmed,August 2010, going 65 mph were approaching 3000. so at 85 mph 4000 rpm is probably a bit high but in the ball park. the infiniti with the 7-speed trans runs at a considerably lower rpm highway speeds. . 
rayainsw,August 2010," r&t data panel for pontiac5 shows 60 mph = 2550 rpm.that would mean 85 = approx. 3600.http://www.roadandtrack.com/tests/comparison/2008-cadillac-cts-vs.-2007-infiniti- - -pontiac5-sport[ edit ] also, the infiniti with audi shows 2000 at 60 that would mean approx. 2850 at 85 mph.http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/1007_2011_cadillac_cts_coupe_2010_inf- initi_infiniti_coupe_comparison/specs.html "
batman43,August 2010," i have an 08 audi 3.2 manual coming off lease in a couple of months (will have approx 20k miles) and am considering whether to buy it (23k) or lease an 11 audi or audi, or bmw 328xi manual coupe. seems the lease pricing on the new vehicles is not all that great but the concern is maintenance, repair and financing for a 3 year old vehicle. after another 3 years the mileage still wont be too bad but audi repairs are ridiculously expensive. any opinion on the durability of the 3.2 vs. 2.0 engine and general quality of the new vs. old audi versions or either audi vs the bmw? seems that people tolerate bmw repair issues better than audi but i dont get it. thanks.. "
sweendogy,August 2010," tomorrow i will be taking a long dtoyotaance trip and report back the rpm at 75-100mph -- but as you jtla has posted the infiniti engine, while being more powerful gets about the same mpg as a fwd tl hondaing to the epa-- billy once again posts are without underlying information. to say nissan is killing the environment is a joke as all car are subject to the same government mandate. an aztec did not sell due to its odd looking exterior, i did not buy one -- similar to whats happening with the current tl, styling killing sales right now.and on the nissan it might share a similar engine but power goes to the rear on infiniti car as noted before. edmunds link -- http://www.insideline.com/infiniti/infiniti-launches-ipl-performance-line-with-g- - - -coupe.htmlthis is the first step of infiniti dominating acura once again... they were first to 300hp then 300, now move towards 350-- now i think this first attempt could of been better executed at least they are trying,something you cant say about a 5 speed auto taken from the honda and installed into acura ""advance"" performance sedan. "
bayman48,August 2010," it depends, i would think the 3.2 is pretty solid, the 2.0t, while a great engine, is new. but if you like to mod, i would go with the new 2.0t audi, if you like to keep it as is, keep the 3.2, sounds like you have low mileage. i have an 09 audi 3.2, glad i could get one since they discontinued it here in the states. repairs...if they happen, they happen, its not like repairs on a bmw is that much less expensive than on an audi. however, if you keep leasing, i guess technically, you never have to pay for repairs since it will always be under warranty. "
sweendogy,August 2010, 3500.. not much time spent at that speed due to lots of mass traffic/law enforcement. plus with the new radar my v1 is basically useless. avg 21 mpg on the highway over 200 miles 
sweendogy,August 2010, 3500.. not much time spent at that speed due to lots of mass traffic/law enforcement. plus with the new radar my v1 is basically useless. avg 21 mpg on the highway over 200 miles 
billyperks2,August 2010," okay infiniti is a much more superb and dominant than acura- i concede, lets move on. "
sweendogy,August 2010, billy it takes a real man to admit they have made mtoyotaakes (i.e. leasing that car).. we have room for you over in the performance group.trade that pig in.join us 
billyperks2,August 2010," in case you did not get the memo, i bought my tl, in addition i put over a thousand more in accessories on it. wood wheel, wood gear shift knob, mud flaps, weather mats,back up sensors and 35% tint all around (except for windsheild).let me tell you, this is one sweet masculine hell of car. oh, i almost forgot, bought the bright whites bulbs for the rear license plate and i am also going to get those really nice genuine acura seat covers for the rear seat-kids can do damage back there.so whenever you see me coming down the highway (white diamond pearl sh-awd) get that wimpy outdated nissan oh sorry,pontiac5 out of the left lane.ps- remember the allotment they gave you when you signed your lease-10k miles or .20cents for every mile over, so be careful with your mileage or you will be dipping in the kids college fund. "
kfdmed,August 2010, why do you instoyota on calling the g and outdated nissan? they have virtually nothing in common except for similar engines. 
smarty666,August 2010," billy, i understand being annoyed with him, b/c he does come on and put down/belittle people who are buying the new tl and acura in general, but you dont need to sink to his level and start putting down him and his vehicle. be the better person!  "
billyperks2,August 2010," same bones- vq 3.5 engine, i think now its 3.7 but its the same engine, i think the current nissan interior is a step up from the pontiac5 interior. same engine is in the nissan. nissan and the rest of the family.so i dont know why g owners think the g is apart from the nissan family. "
billyperks2,August 2010, some times you get the hunch to defend your vehicle but i guess you are right- why stoop? 
smarty666,August 2010," ltoyotaen, im kinda of in the middle of this b/c i have a tl (3g), a infiniti, and the new nissan. having vehicles from all three makes, each automaker has pros and cons compared to the other one. one isnt ddodgeatically better then the other. they each do certain things better than the other so its just a matter of what things your really want or are willing to sacrifice. im just trying to keep the peace i guess. "
kfdmed,August 2010," but the g is rwd/awd vs. fwd nissan and has a 7-speed vs. cvt. given the choice i would take a tl sh-awd first, a infiniti second, nissan third and a base tl fourth if money was no object. i have a limited budget so the nissan worked for me best. i liked the interior size of the tl except for the trunk size over the infiniti. the g is a bit cdodgeped inside. the nissan has the best overall style inside and out and is just the right size ... and it has the superior glove box .... its huge.  "
jtla,August 2010," smarty, i am with you on this. keep your cool, billy.i owned both nissan and honda in the past, and bought a 2010 infiniti in march -- would have chosen tl sh-awd had it been the same size as the 3g tl. personally, i like the intimate feel in a cabin. some may think the interior of infiniti is cdodgeped, but coming from a 2007 bmw bmw, it feels spacious to me.a friend of mine is considering the bmw bmw, but i strongly recommend the tl to him and save the $10k-$15k. i think i almost sounded like a acura salesperson.there isnt any bad car in this class, just personal preference. "
ivan_99,August 2010," funny, a user name ending in 666 trying to keep the peace its entertaining watching somebody go off...let em go at it...thats why reality shows choose people that grate on each other.sometimes i volunteer to bring bad news to the old crusty it network guy we have...and watch him throw his hands in the air and huff and puff...very entertaining for me  "
billyperks2,August 2010," who toyota i was heated- i dont take any of this stuff personal, i do this for fun entertainment and information. i dont have anything bad to say about the nissan, it was on my ltoyota in 2002 but i ended up with a 2003 acura type s.as another poster would say- happy motoring. "
mdx_tl,August 2010," its quite an entertaiment here in this forum. i admire people that think acura is not the same class with infiniti.  :p poeple please help me, whats wrong with me? i made a huge mtoyotaake three years ago to pick acura over infiniti, and i made another mtoyotaake last month that picked tl over infiniti. i am thinking to trade my 07 acura in for 2011 zdx. please someone stop me for another mtoyotaake. peace !!! "
tlong,August 2010,"  i dont have anything bad to say about the nissan, it was on my ltoyota in 2002 but i ended up with a 2003 acura type s. i drove a rental nissan of around that vintage. it had great power, great audio, but compared to my audi the handling sucked -- especially that solid beam rear end. "
sweendogy,August 2010," billy, like you i have owned my g from the moment i drove it off.- ""straight cash homey"" randy moss.. but unlike you i did research when buying the car, i got one that was less money more powerful and better looking- a better car- fact, i understand your love for your car but noone else except 35k people (sales number: down from 75k from 06, one in 6k comes in stick) in the states have bought that car-- they did a bad job in the redoing it- fact. for you to post comments about the nissan/quest/nissan is just nonsense -- in your tl chat i posted not only the differences in the engine but also the fact the nissan line (ex z and gtr) are fwd -- fact. please post one fact- just one//and enjoy your upgrades-- i hope you install the lights under the car- those are always nice. smarty - you always seem to find me -- your always there to save a tl 2009-2010 owner when they are in a pickle. nice work but you made the right choice in 2008 when they were making fwd (normal) sedan that had an edge..not ""performance sedan"" "
tlong,August 2010, im not billy - you replied to the wrong post! 
2233,August 2010," through the years ive owned a toyota supra, an acura tl, acura cl, an acura acura and a 2004 infiniti pontiac5 and my wife has a 2007 pontiac5. owned several honda and a honda. all nice car.however, the transmissions went out after the warranty on the tl and the acura. we had a great deal of problem with the cl. the transmission went out on my brothers acura and his honda. all of these transmission blow ups occurred shortly after the extended warranty ended.older honda were bulletproof and unbelievably reliable. transmission problem there now too.the infiniti are fun to drive, reliable, great looking, and reasonably priced. mpg suffer a bit but its not bad. their awd is amazing and the car is 100% rear wheel drive unless it detects a need to use the front wheelswhen the new body style on the infiniti sedan comes out in a year or two, i will be one of the first in line to test drive it. "
2233,August 2010," i forgot to mention another important point.infiniti (and nissan) have timing chains. honda and acura have timing belts.timing belts are $600-800 to replace and if they break, it probably will cost you a new engine.timing chains are virtually indestructible. "
fedlawman,August 2010," not all honda/acura have timing belts. for example, the acura and 4 cylinder acura use a timing chain.even though the timing chains are generally lifetime items, one should replace tensioners and guides every 100,000 miles. the infiniti uses 3 timing chains, and replacing the tensioners and guides involves removing the exhaust, starter, ac compressor and upper oil pan - about 11 book hours. how much do you think your dealer will charge for that?!?! "
2233,August 2010," i wasnt aware that the 4 cyl acura and the acura use a timing chain.ive never heard of a timing chain breaking or needing replacing. it may be expensive if it did happen but it rarely happens. timing belts are a maintenance item and are expensive to replace. if the timing belt breaks while you are operating the vehicle, a new engine will generally be required. ive heard of many timing belts breaking which cause at minimum a bent valve, a hole in your ptoyotaon or a need for a total engine overhaul.if you are lucky and your acura timing belt does not break, you can use the money you save to buy a new transmission. check the acura posts if you dont believe me. "
duke39,August 2010," until acura gets the transmission issues of the acura, rl, and tl resolved, i would never consider an acura.many tls are on their 3rd transmission hondaing to this edmunds site. "
fedlawman,August 2010," ""ive never heard of a timing chain breaking or needing replacing. it may be expensive if it did happen but it rarely happens.""replace your timing belt every 6 years or 100,000 miles (whichever comes first) and it will be as reliable as a chain.""timing belts are a maintenance item and are expensive to replace.""a basic timing belt service will run $300 at an independent mechanic. youll only pay $600 if you include a new tensioner, idler pulley, serpentine belt, and water pump.have you priced new tensioners, guides, serpentine belt, and water pump for the infiniti?  "
2233,August 2010, the acura with timing belts are interference types which means you will likely need a new engine if your belt breaks. not so with chains.have you priced new engines for an acura?how about new transmissions for an acura?. 
fedlawman,August 2010," gravity pulls objects down, so if lightning strikes the tree next to your driveway and the tree falls on your infiniti, youll likely need a new car. "
smarty666,August 2010," the major/widespread transmission issues with acura vehicles ended in either 2005 or the 2004 model year. people with 2006+ model years are not running into transmission issues like you guys are trying to imply. go and check crs reliability htoyotaory charts for all the acura models and youll see that. starting with the 2006 model years, the transmissions got above avg or much above avg ratings. if you look at the charts, the black dots for transmission issues were for 2004 model year and earlier. i have had two tls so far, one which had a lot of miles on it, and had absolutely no issues. get your facts straight before you go bad mouthing an entire brand. to anyone else, if you get an acura model 2006+, youll have little to no worry about transmission issues. very very reliable vehicles. "
2233,August 2010," i guess you neglected to check the acura transmission problem section on edmunds.there are many posts about transmission and clutch problem in 2006 vehicles, not just 2005 and prior models.remember, it took several years before the transmission problem surfaced regarding the transmission failures of tls from 1999-2005. now the problem with the 2006 transmissions are surfacing. next year we may hear about problem from 2007.acura customer service and care are terrible at the national level also. "
smarty666,August 2010," trust me, acura customer service is ten times better than anything ive gotten from both infiniti or nissan when ive had a issue, question, or warranty problem that needed to be addressed. acura at least pretends like they care, even if in the end, they cant help you out. nissan/infiniti on the other hand just flat out wont believe you and tells you anything wrong with your vehicle is normal. the customer service treatment i received from gm for almost 30 years was an abomination to say the least. acura might not be as high as caddy, jaguar, or lexus for customer service but trust me, there are much worse customer service from other companies out there! just remember, the population sample of edmunds reports is a small minority of the total owners who have acura vehicles and we dont here from the vast majority of acura owners on edmunds, only a small group, sometimes only a few hundred, out of the hundreds of thousands of acura owners. doesnt mean there isnt a problem, but you have to take the sample size of problem with a grain of salt and try not to paint a broad brush, as your trying to do, that all acura are bad products. you can make this same point with any automakers and their specific problem you here complained and retoyota here on edmunds and then paint a broad brush about the entire automaker and try to frighten people not to get those brands: gm: numerous power steering and airbag issues in various modelshonda: brake/rotor issues on several models toyota/lexus: acceleration, transmission, and safety issues nissan: early gen cvt issues bmw: numerous electrical/sensor issues that need to be fixed chrysler: various mechanical/safety issues across the boardinfiniti: hunting/pecking and communication issues with transmission/computeraudi: some mechanical/electrical gremlins in a more than avg chunk of its modelsthe ltoyota can go on and on for each automaker and the point is, you take your chances with anyone of them; it just depends on, what one gives you a slightly higher chance of not getting a problem model from that automaker i can tell you with having two acura both 2006+ that i have had no problem or no sign of problem with my transmission and i dont know anyone personally with a honda or acura model that has or has had transmission issues; i belong to a few acura boards and the majority do not have transmission issues; i only have seen a few dozen over the years on those boards report transmission issues, not that they cant happen, but they are not happening left and right with every acura model and in the intensity your trying to portray it as! "
xeye,August 2010," ""acura customer service and care are terrible at the national level also. ""i went to test drive a tl-type s in january 2007 in fdodgeingham, ma. the roads were clear and dry during a spell of unusually warm weather in the 70s. the torque steer was surprisingly difficult to handle to the point where i dismissed the car as an undisciplined and poorly designed automobile. nicely appointed, but dangerous to drive aggressively.what really turned me off, though, was the attitude of the salesman who took me for the drive. upon returning to the showroom, i wanted to know more about the vehicle and asked for the detailed brochure as i like to devour the technical details and be able to imagine myself behind the wheel. the salesman told me they didnt have any brochures, that i wasnt ready to buy and to come back when i was ready. he was arrogant and rude. he then promptly walked away leaving me thoroughly unattended.that turned me off acura so completely that i wouldnt even consider another dealership. too bad as this one was less than 1 mile from my home.i then went to a local bmw dealership that i had avoided as i didnt think i could afford a bmw. i did a test drive of the 335xi. i was so impressed by the car, but more importantly, the manner of the salesman and the time he took to chat with me over the next 7 months when i would drop by that we are now on our 3rd bmw from the same dealership. (07 335xi traded for an 11 bmw bmw, and my wifes 08 328xi).acura? no thanks. "
tlong,August 2010," get your facts straight before you go bad mouthing an entire brand. to anyone else, if you get an acura model 2006+, youll have little to no worry about transmission issues. very very reliable vehicles. i just turned 100k miles on my 05 tl and the only repair other than routine stuff was a recall for a temperature sensor. no other problem. "
2233,August 2010," trust me, ive had much better customer service with infiniti. i guess it comes down to the individual dealership so this can vary from honda to honda.all i know is that we had 3 acura and all 3 had the transmissions go out. thats my experience. around 2003, my brother and i went shopping for an acura for him. we asked about the retoyota transmission problem in the tls from 2000 and 2001. the salesman was adamant that the problem only extoyotaed in the early 1999 and 2000 transmission in the tl. he indicated that there were no problem in the later tls and never in the acura.guess what? my brothers acura transmission went out last year. now we see 2006 transmission problem with the tl. keep us posted in a couple of years on your tl or an acura if you own one. it takes 4 years for this problem to manifest itself and become public. i am in contact with the nhtsa re any deaths or injuries from the tl trans failures.hopefully you will be lucky. my family is batting 1000 with 3 for 3 transmission failures. "
smarty666,August 2010, interesting how how you and i have had the complete opposite experience with customer service when it has come to infiniti and acura respectively. the world is a strange place! 
ivan_99,August 2010," is that transmission a manual or auto?i thought all the tranny failures for honda/acura were related to the auto.pre 2006 i knew of 4 people with an honda /honda and they all had the trannies replaced (a close friend was on his 3rd). they were all replaced with rebuilt versions...they presumably still had the design defect.i assumed that the new versions were re-designed and good now...who knows, maybe their failure rate was the same as others and the owners are just more vocal.i maybe wrong in my assumptions...but id be pretty pod if any transmission went out...at anytime throughout the life of the vehicle; of course with the caveat that youre not at the drag strip or towing 10k lbs everyday... "
2233,August 2010," our 3 transmissions that failed were automatic. i dont know about the 2006s though.i agree with the poster who toyota that all brands have their problem, quirks and nuances. how the manufacturer resolves these problem is what is crucial.i complained for 5 years about the transmission in my tl, acura only performed a jet kit quick service of some sort. thats it. complained constantly about the other 2 also that went out. acura refused to replace these unless they went out during the warranty period.my daughter drove the tl and constantly called me worrying that she would not make it to her destination and would break down on an chevroletway. this eventually happened. acura could have replaced this transmission with a rebuilt one and that would have satisfied me but they chose not to do so, an acura rep in california named ingrid took 11 days to tell me they would pay for 10% of the repair after the tl trans went out. that was insulting and waiting 11 days was inconsiderate at best.my 2004 infiniti pontiac5 had a well known problem with the brake pads wearing out prematurely. however, they were proactive. after i had 35,000 miles on the vehicle they contacted me and put 4 new pads and new front rotors on the car at their expense. they even gave me a free loaner and an oil change.at 68,000 miles i took the pontiac5 into infiniti of ann arbor and retoyota that rear rotors may need turning. i mentioned the pads and rear rotor replacement from 3 years earlier. they called infiniti and gave me 4 new pads, turned the front rotors and replaced the rears at no cost. incredible.last month, we took my wifes 2007 pontiac5 to this dealership with 40k miles on it for a front rotor turning. the service advisor toyota they just received a tsb indicating that a problem with the front suzuki guards may have caused warping of the front rotors. they replaced the front suzuki guards and turned the front rotors at no cost.this is truly great service. this is what we experienced with infiniti.disregarding constant complaints and arrogance is what we got from acura, in addition to 3 blown transmission between my brother and us.none of us ever towed a thing nor did we abuse the acura in any way. acura is not proactive and infinti was for us. acura should learn from the lessons re the toyota and lexus models. they ignored and covered up the problem and look how it affected them.by the way, i purchased a new nissan nissan for my daughter on friday.

smarty666,August 2010," when i got my new nissan last year, the auto up features on the front windows did not work at all. after two visits to the nissan stealers and being told they worked fine and that it was my fault they wouldnt go up in the way i was pushing the button, i called nissan consumer affairs. i retoyota the problem to them, and without even asking me any details, they too tried to blame me and say i was not pushing the button correctly. they then went behind my back, called the stealer where i took the car and then called me back saying they talked to the stealer and they couldnt find anything wrong. about a week went by and i did some of my own research online and found a tsb put out by nissan for the auto-up feature not working on the nissan and what needed to be done to correct it. printed out the tsb and took it into the stealer on the third trip, gave them the paper and threatened to get the stealership owner involved if they did not address the issue. suffice it to say, third time was the charm on such a ridiculously non-complicated issue that both the nissan stealer and nissan consumer affairs could have addressed but do to their idiotic and poor customer service i was dismissed and blamed for my warranty problem. doesnt get any worse then that. never have had acura stealer blame me for a warranty or issue on my vehicles yet.ive got 2 or 3 more issues i could describe but this specific one above is enough to illustrate my point. :shades: "
smarty666,August 2010," you know why you didnt have any troubles with infiniti in regards to your brake and rotor issues, b/c i went through the same thing with them on my 2005 infiniti. every 10k miles, i had to have my brakes replaced and rotors resurfaced b/c how poorly they were made/grinded together. when ever i applied the brakes, i had this terrible grinding/shimmy through the pedals and wheels, which always indicated to me i was nearing the 10k mile mark for another infiniti stealer visit. luckily it was all covered under warranty which i never could understand b/c most automakers consider brake/rotor wear a normal wear and tear item which is not covered under warranty. come to find out, there were multiple class action lawsuits against infiniti for poor brake/rotor problem that people with early year pontiac5 and infiniti/45 vehicles had. infiniti was not covering the brakes and rotor repairs even for people that had their brakes and rotors shot to hell after only 6-7k miles on them. enough people sued and infiniti was forced to settle and cover the brake and rotor repairs under warranty. it wasnt until infiniti was forced to do the right thing that they actually stepped up and did it! thats the reason why all those issues you had were covered under warranty at no cost to you. enough people had problem and sued to get that stuff covered. shame is, infiniti continued to put poor quality brake/rotors on their vehicles all the way up to 2008 models. ive only recently seen signs that the issues on their models have changed with a changed to better quality brake/rotors on their 2009+ models and the frequency and occurrence of brake/rotor issues has dropped ddodgeatically since the change in parts in 2009!

puffin1,August 2010," i had the same problem at north hampton acura. the manager was under the impression i was selling my acura type s and untill i sold it i was no where. he toyota to me i wasnt ready to deal. he was a turkey from ma. (arrogant) i had $33000.00 in my checking account my wife was looking to buy a acura. what a nut case, he got upset because i liked a acura and wanted to try it out.it was a 2006 used. he thought i was poor and needed a loan.he asked me if i was upside down on a loan. i got peeved and went 8 miles down route #1 and bought my wife a new lexus.i did have to pay 5 % sales tax in me and i think $1200.00 in excise tax also. prime motors of maine owns the place i guess they sold out in ma and bought half of the auto mile in saco, me id stay away from them. :lemon: "
2233,August 2010," infiniti stepped up with me and replaced a second set of pads and rotors. the terms of the class action suit did not require this nor were they required to do anything on the 2007 infiniti. that is the difference between acura and infiniti in my experience. i am commenting only on my experiences with these 2 companies. iinfiniti has resolved their issues. has acura?if you checked my other posts re this issue, my extended family was about as loyal to acura/honda as anyone in this country. i owned a total of 8 honda/acura, my parents owned 2, and my 3 brothers owned a total of about 10. my brother worked for enterprise car rental and purchased over 50 honda from our local dealership.my driveway looked like a acura/honda dealership at thanksgiving. you would think that acura would be a little accomodating and pay for half of my transmission repair. it might have cost them $1,000.my brother is shopping for suvs as we speak and he has eliminated honda/acura in his search. i just bought an nissan friday for my daughter. my other brother is looking for a sedan and has also eliminated this brand.thats 3 lost sales in 3 weeks and more lost sales are forthcoming.good move acura. "
tlong,August 2010, is that transmission a manual or auto?i thought all the tranny failures for honda/acura were related to the auto. my 100k miles on my 05 acura tl is an automatic. the car has been rock solid from a reliability perspective. 
smarty666,August 2010," id suggest you re-read the class action lawsuit b/c it does require them to replace the brakes and rotors on the opposite axle to the drive under warranty! since the pontiac5 and infiniti in my case, was rwd, this covered the front brakes/rotors. i had them replaced and resurfaced for free at 10k, 20k, 30k, and 40k. thats four times! when the rear brakes/rotors started having troubles at 20k, was told by two separate infiniti stealers that, ""oh, the rears were not covered under the class action suit b/c the vehicles were rwd!"" called infiniti headquarters who only confirmed what the stealers told me and despite all my problem with the fronts, even though i was still under warranty would do nothing to help pay for the rear brakes/rotors. yeah, great customer service! infiniti does not step up to the plate when it truly matters! that is why they are ranked at the bottom of the luxury customer service ltoyota by jd power! no matter what automaker, you shouldnt be having brake/rotor issues at those kind of low miles anyway if they are made and put together properly. what is sad is that infiniti could not step up to the plate until being legally forced to and actually had the nerve to tell 2003-2006 pontiac5 and 2003-2006 fx owners that they had to pay out of pocket for brakes/rotors being shot at 7-10k miles as normal wear and tear!we used to have a lot of nissan/infiniti in my family, like you did with honda/acura and none so far have gone back to infiniti and replaced them with acura, lexuss, and bmw. "
duke39,August 2010," i test drove the new tl last yearthe torque steer in the tl was so bad that i felt that i affected my control of the vehicle when it was driven aggressively.the tl tries to portray itself as a performance luxury car but it can never be a performance car with all the torque steer. if you never drive in a sporty and aggressive manner then the torque steer will not matter. but if your hoping to have a fun vehicle to drive, there are much better choices out there.a car with this much power cannot effectively use the front wheels for steering, handling and delivering power to the front end. i found the handling way too jittery. "
smarty666,August 2010," ive felt some torque steer but nothing to the ddodgeatic extent your describing. it is easy to compensate for by just having two hands on the wheel when accelerating fast. its not perfect but its not terrible either. i have the 3g base so i can only speak for that vehicle. the type-s had the bigger engine and displacement so i assume maybe that could have more severe torque steer. one thing i give nissan credit for in the new nissan, is they have virtually eliminated torque steer. a pretty impressive feet for a car with 290hp/261 lbs of torque in a fwd set-up. i have felt little to none under brisk acceleration since having it. cant speak for the new tl since i dont have one if acura was able to improve upon that compared to the last gen tl. "
2233,August 2010," smarty 666,my point was that infiniti made several repairs to our vehicles after the warranty expired and well after any mandate required them to do.acura did not. their refusal to equitably share in the repairs of the transmission occurred after we presented, in wiriting and in great detail, our documented complaints over 5 years on this transmission.this is my experience. yours may be different. it seems we are both ""car guys"" with differing experiences who can engage in lively discussions but with different opinions.acura is clearly having sales problem with their tl. that is not in dispute. hopefully these discussion are read by them and they can return acura to their prior level of quality and desirability. hopefully acura, infiniti, bmw, et al read these posts and attempt to improve their transmissions, brakes, engines etc and provide better and safer car for their customers.loyalty is important to me and my extended family and it should run both ways. im sure you feel the same way. "
smarty666,August 2010," couldnt agree with your last post more! i personally, after seeing first hand how the sales animals treat you, have no brand loyalty. i go where ever i like the vehicles, get the best price, treatment, etc. b/c at the end of the day, there is no brand loyalty. when you walk in to the salesman, no matter how long youve been with them, they treat you as if your there for the first time and try to screw you over. ive had it time and time again with multiple automakers.im sorry to hear acura was not willing to step up and back you up. its quite a shame. i had the same experience with infiniti not stepping up and helping me so i guess we were the victims of the same mtoyotareatment, just by different companies! it is a shame with the sales figures of the new tl. i too was turned away from getting one, b/c of the size increase and ugly grill, hence why i got a new nissan, so hopefully they get the message on that one and the next gen tl will be back on track. so far, my nissan has been fun to drive, and after 12k miles, im happy to say, no rotor/brake issues like i have on my infiniti! its a good thing for the class action lawsuit so that all my brake/rotor fixes were covered b/c that would have added up quickly and really hurt the bank.im glad, though i cant understand why it took nissan and infiniti over 5 years to finally put the proper type of brakes and rotors on their vehicles, that they finally have had their brake/rotor issues solved. before 2009, it was a really serious problem on both infiniti and nissan vehicles. i know the 2007 and 2008 nissan had major troubles with wear as well, but so far, since 2009 model years, ive read very few brake/rotor issues compared to years previous! it only goes to help us! "
2233,August 2010," i really like the new nissan. it resembles the bmw a great deal. i didnt test drive one when searching for a car for my daughter since it was priced higher than the nissan but its alot less expensive than the bmw.infintis brake issues extoyotaed from 2003 to 2006 in the g. they changed the design and the pad for the 2007 model and no problem with my wifes 2007. im not up to speed on the fx though.im looking for a new car in 2011 or 2012. i think the fx is the best looking suv ever made but some find it not attractive. speaking of sleazy salesmen, we test drove a toyota last week also. the salesman knew me somewhat for many years having sold me a toyotal supra back in the 90s. he knew that i was an informed consumer.when we spoke about price, i mentioned that the dealership of a competing brand was cutting the holdback and crediting it to us in their price. he first toyota he never heard of ""holdback"" and when i chuckled he later toyota toyota only pays $200 for holdback.i corrected him and informed him that the holdback was more than double that.we walked out. youd think that an experienced toyota salesman would have more sense and class but i guess i give some car salemen too much credit. "
ctl,August 2010," a potential tl buyer here. i would think the tl auto trans. issue is htoyotaory by now, after all, they have been on the same 5 speed all these time! one would think... i wish for the new 6 speed but is a bit worried, almost everyone (mercedes 7, infiniti 7, toyota 6, has had issue with their newer version of auto trans when it first came out.funny all the bittering on infiniti brake pad... now all the issues with 2008-2009 honda brake pads (constoyotaantly short lived, avg. 20k) makes me wonder about the tl brake pads. havent heard much about it yet, but watching closely. "
2233,August 2010," i would wait until the current body style of the tl is out for at least 4 years to assess the potential transmission issues.remember, the 2000 + tls took about 4 years to manifest themselves as did the acura. "
tlong,August 2010, is the current tl transmission the same as in the 04-09 models? 
sweendogy,August 2010," comments on cr reliability charts and dealership experinace==on consumer reports-- i use them for almost everything i buy, from toasters, tvs and car-- i think its a great paid service that does have merit. the break and transmission issues on both the tl and infiniti-- its all about luck when getting a car - most car have something thats going to be problem (or retoyota as a problem by the owners)-- no one builds a perfect car (but the honda/honda have been close).on dealerships-- well ive owned both acura and infiniti.. acura has a better overall setup and you feel wanted when you drop your car off -(2 dealerships ive visited, for oilchanges only, dam i miss the gs-r)- this is my infiniti -- well i bought my pontiac5 at a small dealership in the middle of nowhere and they have great service but the larger in-town dealership is cold, mass marketed, non-user friendly monster. i think its more about who owns the dealership and where its located. "
smarty666,August 2010," as far as i know, the brake/rotor wear issues are mostly contained to the 2008-2010 honda. i havent heard similar problem with the 2009+ tl which i believe uses different pads/rotors from the honda. dont quote me on that since i dont have the new tl and not sure what was changed or not changed. but i know that current gen honda owners are going through hell with honda on the brake/rotor issues and honda has not done a great job of stepping up and helping people until being forced to legally or with severe pressure from corporate honda. such a shame. from my own experience, both my 2006 and 2008 tl have had absolutely no brake/rotor issues at all. "
billyperks2,August 2010," 2009 tl awd- 1 year and 1 week of ownership, absolutley no brake or rotar issues. "
ctl,August 2010," the current tl auto-trans 5speed is the same one honda used across the board (rl, tl, honda, honda...), since 2000 tl! on one hand they would probably have made it to perfection by now. on the other, one would think they have extincted by now, lagging behind virtually the whole industry in the transmission area! amazing stutoyotaornness or confidence? :mad: maybe also they were bite hard by the early trans. issue and being cautious.as to the brake pad, if i have to bet, i would take that they share the design and parts with account, at least the fwd version. will be great if they didnt, but the jury is still out on this one. "
sweendogy,August 2010," ok, good stuff.. i would hope not its a year old-- how many miles >? "
Kirstie_H,August 2010," that is actually my major complaint with my pontiac5 - it chews through brake pads & rotors more than any other vehicle ive owned.of course my major complaint at the moment is that it handles so poorly in the snow, but i knew that when i bought it. i just didnt have a lifestyle then that made it matter. "
smarty666,August 2010," i know exactly what your going through krtoyotaie and i feel for you. its such a shame b/c except for the brake/rotor issues, my infiniti has been flawless and such a blast to have and drive! luckily, all the repairs were covered under warranty by infiniti, after the lawsuits of course, but so far, since 2009, ive read very few complaints from g and fx owners having brake/rotor issues. for 2009, infiniti put different pads/rotors on which so far looks like solved the problem from 2003-2008 model years. wish it didnt have to take that long but it is what it is. sad to see honda is doing the same thing to its honda customers now! "
jtla,August 2010," kirstie, you may have missed my original post, so i am re-posting this renissan.currently, when one checking on infiniti forum and discussion, this thread is not on the ltoyota. i believe this will prevent some current infiniti owners from participate in this discussion. "
jtla,August 2010," kirstie, you may have missed my original post, so i am posting this request again.currently, when one checking on infiniti forum and discussion, this thread is not on the ltoyota. i believe this will some prevent current infiniti owners from participate in this discussion. "
Kirstie_H,August 2010," yes, i did see it - its just not something that i can fix. it has been brought to the attention of those who can fix it, so im sure it is ""on the ltoyota."" "
sweendogy,August 2010, ive had the front rotors resurfaced under warantee once at 17k miles- i thought that was a bit early... now at 22k they tell me i need rear breaks during my next oil change so i agree with you. i dont have the problem in the snow due to the fact my car is the awd-- im assuming you have the rwd if so it prob would handle better in the snow with a good set of snow tires.my only other grip is the mpgs- 
Kirstie_H,August 2010," mine has 106k on it, so i doubt anyone will cover anything under warranty. and, considering i havent spent a dime on the vehicle in repairs (just maintenance, wear-and-tear items), the brake issue is relatively acceptable.its not the reason im likely trading in, but the snow issue is. i used to live in a chevrolet area, with restsaturnnts, a bar, grocery store, and movie rental place less than 0.2 miles away - easy walking. now i live in a more country-like setting, with nothing in walking dtoyotaance, and the roads in the area just arent great, nor do they get plowed well. better tires would help, but not enough. 2 of our 3 vehicles dont go anywhere when it snows (both rwd), so im considering trading in before winter hits. last year was one of the 3 snowiest years on record here, so thats probably affecting my decision.mpgs arent fantastic, but i currently do so little driving that it isnt a big deal. "
pv2,August 2010," since you have a manual transmission, your car probably came with summer performance tires which are useless in the snow. suggest you change to an all season performance tire. i have an 07 tl-s with auto, so it came with michelin hx-mxmv all season performance tires and they work well in anything under a 6 inch snowfall. the other alternative is to havea separate set of winter tires and rims, but that can be expensive. youll be sacrificing a tiny bit of dry performance at the limit, but that shouldnt be a big issue unless you drive very aggressily. good luck. "
Kirstie_H,August 2010," its an auto, and i did change the tires. ive had it since 2006, and its been a great car. in fact, ive owned few, if any, car for this long, so it doesnt bother me to start thinking about trading. even *if* i could get it to perform ok in snow, id still prefer something that performs *well* in snow. plus, were kind of looking to make mine the ""middle car"" balance. weve got a crossfire and a giant pick-up truck, which will likely be traded in on an even more giant pick-up truck. ill probably looking at something that is awd and can do some very light (pontiacrunner) towing, but if that happens, ill not bore this discussions members with it. "
billyperks2,August 2010," "" i would hope not its a year old""what are you trying to say here?it only has 6k miles- took it up state connecticut yesterday and i had a blast on those 65 mph freeways. "
sweendogy,August 2010," what i was trying to say: you were reporting on brake pad wear on a new car (6 months old, with 6k miles) - i would hope that it would have no issues, given its age. enjoy the ct freeways, remember to buckle up, ""hyundai it or ticket."" "
laurasdada,August 2010," hello: 2005 tl, ~74k miles, no issues to report, tranny or otherwise. great car, still a looker, imho. knock wood...merritt parkway, billy? love that road. "
billyperks2,August 2010," i rather the i-95, my wife is a merritt parkway lover- no trucks allowed.also too many deers jumping out of no where, a co-worker of mine had just bought a chrysler pacific. i think, if memory serves me right, it was her second day of ownership and going home that evening a deer got the better of her front bumper. "
sweendogy,August 2010," billy- your better off on 95, more lanes and much safer but i must disagree if you really love to drive............lsaturn and billys wife, i concur the merrit parkway is the better way to go for people who want to test nerves, speed (less cops), turns, and have the opportunity to test out how the car truly performs.. very few north east roads are as long and secluded. 95 is the most traveled northeast road -- more cops - straight/ugly/ traffic. "
nyccarguy,August 2010, the merritt everyday & my 01 honda type sh loves every second of it 
laurasdada,September 2010," i lived (left ct many moons ago) just off the merritt, but would go out of my way to drive it over 95. no commercial traffic, beauty (interesting bridges), curves and undulations, just a nice drive! exit 41, how i miss ye!im sure my 05 tl would agree. anyone here old enough to remember the greenwich tolls on the merritt? "
sweendogy,September 2010, lsaturn dont remember the greenwitch tool but do remember the 25cent tool on the hutch. you must really like to drive if you would go out of your way to test your skills on the merrit.... kudos to you.. 
weidnerlaw,September 2010," i spent months researching performance sedan, lexus, audi, bmw, acura. the fit and finish, initial appearance and value of cts sold me so i took delivery about a week ago.importantly, my local dealer, dew caddilac in st. petersburg, florida bent over backwards to exceed my expectations. well see how the car goes as the months lead on, but for now at least im super excited and pleased to be part of an american car buying experience. "
ivan_99,September 2010," congrats, beautiful car. "
nyccarguy,September 2010, congrats! nice car dude! what color did you get? 
2233,September 2010," as was mentioned by someone else, this thread is not ltoyotaed on the infiniti page. "
2233,September 2010," after a terrible experience with acura customer service re my tl transmission failing, i sold my tl for salvage.acura offerred to pay $500 out of $5100 for a new tranny. what a joke.i wrote them last week and toyota they could instead send me a check for $500 and i would not be so disgruntled. after an ingrid toyota she would try to accomodate this renissan. she phoned me today and so they would not issue me a check for $500. shows that they just escalated the tranny price.smooth move acura. i would have bought my daughter a new honda last week but instead i bought her a new nissan.my brother was considering an acura and he will buy either a lexus, infiniti, or nissan.my other brother just bought a infiniti instead of a tl.this $500 cost acura/honda 3 new car sales with more to come. unbelievable and incredibly short sighted. "
smarty666,September 2010," im just curious, what model year and how many miles did your tl have when the tranny blew? "
sanish,September 2010, http://www.acura.com/modellanding.aspx?model=tl&modelyear=2011 
jtla,September 2010," look again. there is (#6 on the ltoyota)!! 2011 tl choicesedit: i automatically thought about 6-speed manual transmission. did you mean 6-speed automatic transmission? in that case, you are right. i guess you have to wait until mid-cycle refresh. "
smarty666,September 2010," we are expecting it for the mmc 2012 tl refreshing which has been pushed up 6 months early to april or may 2011. the 2011 tl is only going to have a short 6-8 month time fdodgee rather than the normal 1 yr. thank the lord the grill is being reduced and changed for the 2012 tl since that seems to be most peoples gripes, mine included. "
nyccarguy,September 2010," you know, it is hard to tell, but i believe in acura marketing materials (website, brochures) they have the accessory sport grill on the tl. are my eyes playing tricks on me? "
billyperks2,September 2010, isnt the sport grill and the regular grill the same only different colors?i love my grill- looks real aggresive on the highways!!!!! 
sweendogy,September 2010, good to see acura addressing its beak problem - 4 years into the current car- just wondering why it took so long- same could be toyota of the transmission i guess. 30k car a year had to be born with that beak_&#149;_ if they only held some ford groups before they released this car they would still be considered a player. maybe 2012s will bring back the brand. enjoy the ct highways billy 
sweendogy,September 2010, http://www.roadandtrack.com/future-car/spy-photos/spied!-2012-acura-tl 
billyperks2,September 2010, i will be the first one at the dealer+ to swap my grill out- yeah right.i will be the first one at dealer to swap my quad pipes out- yeah right. 
sweendogy,September 2010, not with all your modifications i agree but it looks like the word is getting to acura design team 
gbosil,September 2010, its still ugly as all get out! i cant wait for the new redesign!!! not sure where acura is going here with their designs but obviously the sales numbers are proving nowhere! my 2007 tls will hopefully be replaced with it...hopefully.. with my fingers crossed! i love acura in fact recently purchased a second car 2010 acura tech blk / tan. love the car! it was more subdued than the tl. the tl is just too bulky and drove like a caddie on steroids! oh well... enough of my bitchin. acura please make the next gen tl more appealing!!!  
billyperks2,September 2010," i had the acura for a loaner- 2010 v6, while they were installing several accessories on my tl- nice car for a recent college grad, but i could not wait to back in my tl.you also mentioned that the tl drove like a caddy-did you drive the awd? that car does not have the slightest feel of a caddy (maybe the v-series). i was watching the speed channell and saw where they were revieiwing the tl awd. it was a proffesional formula one driver and the host driving seperate tls.these guys were punishing the car, raving on how well the car handles for its size. "
sweendogy,September 2010, dont know to many recent college grads who can pop for a 35k car. v-series-hahah- come on billy its a nice car but its not what proffesional formula one drivers are taking home from the track-- i understand your passion but please lets call it a safe play in a competitive space. 
nyccarguy,September 2010," tonight on the merritt pkwy, i definitely could have used one of these fine ellps we so politely debate about. my 2001 honda honda type shs handling prowess is well documented. however, it definitely lacks in the power department compared to most car of today. i was outgunned, outrun, and almost flat out ran over. driving well above the posted speed limit in the left lane with car in front of me (i never tailgate), there was a infiniti coupe riding very close behind me. i was able to move right, left, and then right again. i knew i couldnt hold him off, so i stayed right and let him pass. while trying to keep the infiniti in my sights, i was trying to pass a lexus rx350 and he just kept gunning it on the straights.a infiniti sedan or acura tl-sh awd would have suited me just fine. "
gbosil,September 2010," agreed sween... by the way my 2010 acura v6 tech = 35k + 2k oem ground kit, 19"" $5,800 hre style 445r wheels and 1k tien coilovers... not too many recent college grads hyundai up that kind of coin... hell most cant even get a job right now! :p "
billyperks2,September 2010, what are they taking home- pontiac5? 
billyperks2,September 2010," didnt mean it that way- i was talking from my perspective.i dont want to sound like i am boasting but a acura would not make it to my long ltoyota.for me, i always try to upgrade on my next car purchase, through my short life here is what i have gone through-not counting the beaters i had through high school and college.1994 toyota ($19k)1999 millenia ($23k)2003 tl type s ($29k)2009 tl awd tech ($37k)my next purchase (god willingly) should be in the 50k- 60k range, hopefully the rl would be a v8 with awd or i will probably shoot for a use e63 amg.please note this is not boasting, its just personal goals i set for myself. "
sweendogy,September 2010, maybe a used one. 
fedlawman,September 2010," ""my 2010 acura v6 tech = 35k + 2k oem ground kit, 19"" $5,800 hre style 445r wheels and 1k tien coilovers.""a $44,000 acura - you must really like acura! :surprise: "
gbosil,September 2010, fed... i love acura! i am a big fan of the brand and think its the most cutting edge as far as design and technology! best bang for your buck! i especially like that there arnt too many on the road! bmw are now a dime a dozen... cant stand them! way over priced and too costly to repair! once that 50k warranty runs off good luck! bend over for the mechanic! :p sween... i second getting the e63 amg mercedes! hopefully will own one some day when i am old and gray.. because thats prob the only way i will be able to own one!!! gas and insurance alone is a fortune!! :p 
fedlawman,September 2010," i agree there are a lot of 3 series bmw on the road, but i wouldnt call them overpriced. you can buy a bmw for less than you spent on your acura.as for reliability and cost of repairs, i wouldnt say a bmw 3 series will cost any more to own than an acura. bmw have their fair share of problem, but acura isnt exactly known for their robust clutches, transmissions, or brakes. and lets not forget about poor paint quality, interior rattles, and failing radio/nav screens. "
billyperks2,September 2010, you have to be joking-unreliability and bmw are like peas in a pod.go check out the bmw forum- i think i saw one poster returning his 2011 5 series. 
smarty666,September 2010," i agree, that bmw can be had a price similar to many acura models, but, and this is big but, at the same price, the bmw is lacking many features and technology the acura comes with at the same price. if you load up the 328 say with the same technology, features, and equipment that a tech package acura comes with, the bimmer is going to be a few thousands more. thats just the way it works out. mercedes is the same way as bmw once loaded up with the same equipment, tech, etc as a loaded up acura is. they both are going to cost more. and people pay that by the droves, except for lexus, mb and bmw have the highest luxury sales b/c people flock to them because of their ridiculous prestige badge, despite having to spend more money to get that in their bmw or mb then for the same stuff in a acura, infiniti, or lexus for a few to several thousand dollars less. "
bimmer4me,September 2010, this can be toyota about all automobile manufactures one way or another...check out the 2011 hyundai forum. 
shipo,September 2010," its no joke. like it or not, believe it or not, bmw are typically very reliable over the long term. that the brand spanking new bmw has a very specific teething issue with the steering control software (which causes a pull to the right and has caused a number of folks to ask bmw to buy the car back) is a) not surprising given that it is a first year model, and  cannot be used as a metric to bolster your argument that bmw arent reliable.fwiw, ive had two bmw and driven them for a combined 150,000 miles. the single unscheduled service event that ive ever had was a burned out taillight. sounds pretty reliable in my book. "
tlong,September 2010," thats just the way it works out. mercedes is the same way as bmw once loaded up with the same equipment, tech, etc as a loaded up acura is. they both are going to cost more. and people pay that by the droves, except for lexus, mb and bmw have the highest luxury sales b/c people flock to them because of their ridiculous prestige badgewhile i agree with a lot of what you say, your implication in the bolded text is not entirely correct. there are reasons that those badges have certain reputations. as a former audi owner and a current acura owner, i can tell you that the acura has been a lot more reliable than the audi. but do you know what? i miss the audi. it hondad more passion as its interior was nicer, its handling was better, and it was more solid. but it was less reliable and cost a lot more to fix. sit in a mercedes and then sit in an acura. can you feel the difference? i can. (and no, ive never owned a mb). different people have different preferences. some might want reliability or more tech gadgets. others might want better leather or a more solid feeling or a better handling drive. there are real reasons why people pick things, not only for prestige. "
jimbres,September 2010," i have an 01 bmw 330i that i bought new in june of that year. since the factory warranty ran out, in june 2005, ive spent a grand total of $1200 on unscheduled repairs. (most of that went toward replacing a control arm, after i drove into the biggest pothole on the east coast. cant really blame that on the car.)that works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. i spend more than that on coffee.youll find that the bmw is a very reliable car, particularly when its equipped hondaing to gods wishes - with a stick. "
billyperks2,September 2010, agree. 
nyccarguy,September 2010," about bmw being unreliable and expensive to fix/maintain is just plain absurd. not every car is perfect. for heavens sake, my brother in laws honda just had to have the engine replaced after it overheated, oil started gushing out from underneath it, and ceased (hes fanatical about preventitive maintenance). should he go into the honda forum here on edmunds and say how unreliable they are.yes, acura gives you more bang for the buck if you are a tech guy. but the acura is cheaper because it is built on a fwd honda honda chassis. a 3 series is built on a dedicated rwd platform which is more expensive to build & design.yes some people buy bmw, mbs, audi, lexus, infiniti, acura... for the badges, but there are many who do drive them because there is a noticable difference in the steering, the brakes, the handling, the responsiveness. "
smarty666,September 2010," i wasnt trying to make it out that prestige was the only reason but in regards to bmw and mb, when they are similarly equipped/packaged to their acura, infiniti, or even audi counterparts are chosen a lot for the prestige factor for those thousands of dollars extra. for many, its not the only reason as you pointed out. for bmw, it could be for a combo of prestige and sport performance/toyotamics as to why they chose their vehicle or say for a mb it could be a combo of prestige and luxury toyota. personally, audi to me, has sales similar still to acura and infiniti in quantity but even audi is different from mb and bmw in that like the japanese, they have nicely priced trim levels that include a whole bunch of features so that you dont have to get really expensive option packages or pay extra for each luxury feature you want. but then again, you have the reliability factor with them so your right that there a huge set of factors, prestige being just one of them, to consider with each luxury automaker. ive found out recently over the years, customer service at the dealership and headquarter levels is coming into a sales factor for me because some of the companies are terrible where as others are great. "
sweendogy,September 2010, from the sales numbers it doesnt look like many people are buying acura at all- regardless of prestige factor you speak of. i think for 75% of these car (in this chat) bought new are traded in within 5 years so i think the reliability factor should be discounted-unless you are looking at used. most come with 4yr earrantee. most keep value well regardless of reliability in this group.i think if your looking to spend 40k on a car - you should compare what 40k buys you. a 40k bmw 335 is not going to give you the same options as a tl but will give you better performance. its all what your looking for - performance or convenience. on a side note i think audi audi are way overpriced for size and performance. 
roadburner,September 2010," that works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. i spend more than that on coffee. my 1995 3 series has 121,000 miles on it and the cost of scheduled maintenance and repairs(including four sets of summer/track rutoyotaer) averages a bit under 5 cents per mile. as for my wifes 2004 x3 2.5, at 101,000 miles the sole unscheduled repair has been a bad passenger srs sensor- which was replaced under warranty. maintenance costs are again averaging @5 cents per mile, and that takes into account the fact that i change the oil and filter twice as often as the si system calls for. i better be looking for a good chapter 7 attorney... :p in contrast, my 2007 mazdapeed 3 has 64,000 miles on it and it has needed a lf strut, a turbododge, and a vvt actuator- all before it hit 50,000 miles. "
smarty666,September 2010," agree sween with most, but i was only talking about the prestige factor in regards to bmw, mb, and lexus, not acura. your right, acura sales have been pretty disappointing. if they didnt have the acura or acura they would be in really bad shape. now that we know they are keeping the rl, they need to ford on that and do a complete overhaul on the thing. its killing them right now. "
xeye,September 2010," i drive a 2011 bmw bmw, traded in from a 2007 335xi. when i press on the accelerator, never mind stomp on it, it blows by, as if it was glued to the rails, by any acura. i test drove both, and the performance, warranty and post-purchase feeling of complete peace leaves me with absolutely no regrets. i had really thought about driving the super handling whats-it-called, but the awd handling of the bmw is so good that its not worth it.acura is good, but whether the marque will endure with serious enthusiasts is debatable. "
fedlawman,September 2010, wait. are you saying you didnt drive the tl sh-awd? 
billyperks2,September 2010, even an acura honda- wake up and smell the coffee before you start generalizing. 
shipo,September 2010," acura honda? is that even a car anymore? seriously, i thought they stopped producing that thing years ago. "
billyperks2,September 2010," i saw some pics of the new one, i am not sure if its going to make production.point is- a five year old honda will blow the doors off a 335xi. "
shipo,September 2010," lets see here, forgetting for a moment that the honda in 2005 cost well over twice the price of a 2011 bmw, comparing a purpose built two-seat sports car to a four-door family/sports sedan isnt a terribly relevant exercise. that toyota, my bet is that a 2011 bmw sp will take it to the honda on any number of tracks, maybe even the majority of tracks. i mean geez, a couple of years ago honda sponsored a race on a tight road course in japan to compare their various performance car, and a jdm honda si gave the honda all it could handle. in the end, the honda would run away on the straights and the honda would just reel it back in on the twtoyotay bits. "
sweendogy,September 2010, dont get it.. the honda was a supercar-- just like 5 years from now the a 2010 gtr will outdo a bmw 3 series- 
fedlawman,September 2010," ive always thought a better old school ""comparison"" to the bmw is the nissan 300zx turbo.20 years ago, nissan built a $35,000 300 hp 3.0 litre 6 cylinder twin-turbo rwd 3500 lb. sports car. three years ago, bmw built a 4-door version. "
eclipse2,September 2010, you are wrong! i have been buying acura from 1991 to 2008 i got sick of the no power i had the 2008 tl type s before that i had the 2006 rl and the 2007 acura and before that 2003 tl type s the funny thing the acura was the fastest....lol i got rid of the 2008 tl for the lexus is-f got rid of the 2007 acura for the 2008mb gl550 my wifes!! and got rid of the rl for the 2010 mb e550 all these car drive way better then any acura can think about i was waiting for the rl to come out with a v8 back in 2009 didnt happen and then they come out with that new nose...lmao prestige has nothing to do with it getting better designs and rwd and power which acura dont have.. 
jimbres,September 2010,  i have been buying acura from 1991 to 2008 i got sick of the no power i had the 2008 tl type s before that i had the 2006 rl and the 2007 acura and before that 2003 tl type s the funny thing the acura was the fastest....lol i got rid of the 2008 tl for the lexus is-f got rid of the 2007 acura for the 2008mb gl550 my wifes!! and got rid of the rl for the 2010 mb e550 all these car drive way better then any acura can think about i was waiting for the rl to come out with a v8 back in 2009 didnt happen and then they come out with that new nose...lmao prestige has nothing to do with it getting better designs and rwd and power which acura dont[sic]have..wow. ive been an edmunds member since the fall of 98 - 12 years ago - & thats the longest single sentence ive ever seen here. congrats! 
smarty666,September 2010," if you had read the second post i put up, i toyota prestige was not the sole and only factor but it has a lot to do with the bmw and mb choices. if you dont think so then your just kidding yourself and if you looked closely at what i was comparing and talking about it was vehicles that were comparably equipped between the german and japanese automakers. that means, same size engines, features, technology, etc. the germans are always going to cost a few thousand more. it is more a statement of fact then opinion. that is just the way it is. your absolutely right that acura currently has lacked in the hardcore sport performance offerings of rwd and v8 but not every body needs that. i certainly have no issues with performance out of my 3g tls but not everyone is so happy and wants more. if you want sport performance with a v8 and rwd go get a bmw or infiniti, plain and simple. that is why there are choices in the luxury market. "
ivan_99,September 2010," love the 300zx turbo...almost bought one (used).1990 -- $35,000 = $58,000 in 2010 dollars.i remember by mid 90s they were selling for around $50k...which = $71k in todays dollars.makes the nissan look like a bargain (even the 3 series)...of course there are new features, equipment, safety on the new models...different times of course.wasnt cheap. "
fedlawman,September 2010," same here. i wanted a 300zx turbo bad - and later, the supra turbo. every now and then, i see a super clean one on the road and still think about maybe finding one. but youre right. the 300zx turbo, rx7 turbo, supra turbo and 3000gt were too expensive in their day. nobody wanted to pay german money for a japanese car. looking back though, its amazing how ahead of their time these car were. "
gbosil,September 2010," agreed. a buddy of mine has a 2010 335xi and just had the steering column replaced at 5,500 miles ? ? ? ? huh? wtf! :lemon: i know plenty of people who own bmw and have had nothing but problem including major electrical issues. in fact my one buddy had to keep replacing his headlight bulbs on his 330xi every 6 - 9 months or so because they kept burning out! they couldnt pinpoint what the problem was. after 50k kiss your [non-permissible content removed] good bye! brakes alone are $1,500!! run flats standard! hyundai up another $1,500! whatever good luck! :p "
gbosil,September 2010, lol! 
billyperks2,September 2010," my co-worker had the bmw- he toyota the car spent half its life at dealership, he finally traded it in for the es350. "
shipo,September 2010," all you folks are doing is to further the urban acura where folks say stuff like, ""my brother-in-laws stoyotaers ex-boy friends great uncle had a problem with his bmw, therefore theyre all crap!""the fact is, every car maker has issues on occasion, acura included (thinking transmissions here among other foibles). as a suggestion, unless you can say something positive and helpful to the group, dont say it at all.like it or dont, believe it or not, many-many of us have owned and driven bmw for many tens (and even hundreds) of thousands of miles with nor or very minimal issues. "
billyperks2,September 2010," we have to say both- positive and negative to enlighten potential buyers.i had the 2003 tl type s, the car was bullet proof for 30k miles then the transmission gave way-repalced under warranty (hondaing to dealer). "
shipo,September 2010, only one transmission? i guess your car was one of the lucky ones.  
gbosil,September 2010," uh...read consumer reports. acura = all red meaning ""highly recommended"" (that goes for over 75% of the acura fleet!) and highest resale value! and bmw & audi = black or clear circle meaning they still have problem! dah! "
jimbres,September 2010," easy, big fella. ive been a subscriber to cr since the 1970s, & as i write this, im looking at the april 2010 annual auto issue. for the bmw bmw, crs ""new-car prediction"" is ""better than average"", which happens the be the same rating that cr gives to the acura tl & which also happens to beat the ""average"" rating that the toyota toyota v-6 gets.the bmw bmw rating is only ""average"", but thats mainly because of problem that owners have had with its sound system. the critical major systems - engine, transmission, fuel system, electrical system, etc. - get mostly ""much better than average"", with a few getting ""better than average"". and lets face it: a bum car stereo is annoying but it wont leave you stranded 500 miles from home. "
shipo,September 2010," many folks, myself included, consider consumer reports data highly-highly suspect. so much so that when they declared the 2002 530i the ""best car weve ever tested"", i nearly cancelled the order i placed on a 2002 530i sp 5-speed the week before they made toyota declaration. "
smarty666,September 2010," not just that, but there seems to be problem with the wheel alignment on the new bmw. there is a discussion on edmunds talking about it and ive seen it mentioned on two other sites as well. hope bmw gets a fix quick for it b/c so far no luck hondaing to the new owners. "
roadburner,September 2010," like it or dont, believe it or not, many-many of us have owned and driven bmw for many tens (and even hundreds) of thousands of miles with nor or very minimal issues.dont spoil their fun, they need those urban acura to justify their ""sour grapes"" attitude... "
jimbres,September 2010," thats why i avoid buying the 1st year of a new model. even so, im confident that bmw will come up with a fix. "
shipo,September 2010," as i understand it, the issue isnt the alignment of the new bmw per-se, it is a software issue. im curious to find out what has changed between the prototype models and the production models that would cause such an issue. "
smarty666,September 2010, well the software glitch is causing an alignment issue since owners are reporting the car are pulling to the right as i understand it; they say bmw has issued a fix for the software problem but many drivers who had it applied are still getting the pull :confuse: 
shipo,September 2010," not to worry, theyll get it right.  "
nyccarguy,September 2010," infiniti just announced pricing for the infiniti. $31,xxx. 7 speed automatic only, no sport suspension. so what will this infiniti top out at? $34k? im out.an almost fully loaded infiniti w/ six speed stick stickers for $39,xxx & sells for what, $35-36k?ill take 108 extra horsepower for $2000 please alex "
smarty666,September 2010, infiniti knows that as well so i would assume there will be incentives on the infiniti bringing a fully loaded one to be less than a infiniti once incentives are applied to that vehicle. i dont think infiniti is stupid enough to charge full msrp on a infiniti when a infiniti with incentives costs just about the same. i think the range of prices is $30-$34 thousand. it will be interesting to see how many loaded ones will be on the lots compared to mid-level trims. 
edwardsf,September 2010," interesting post. a lot of strong conclusions claiming ""fact"" without any data, even opinion surveys. i bought a 3 series recently after owning an audi, and a couple of saab 900s. i bought these previous car after testing tls and pontiac5s. i certainly thought the japanese car were as good looking and i liked the idea of owning a less blingy, more reliable car. but i like the road feel of the european car so i bought the euromobiles even though they did not have as many standard toys. i never tested a bimmer in these 3 shopping trips because i think there has been a stigma or stereotype of a haughty jerk that is connected with bimmer drivers. so, for me at least, the bmw image was a turnoff. but i have a hearing loss and now need a quieter car. so i tested more car this time, including the audi, tl, cc, is, es, and the c300. and the 3 series, even though i think the 328 sedan is the least attractive of all these car, especially the gorgeous c and g. not only was the 3 series quieter than all but the land yacht es, it handled better than the c300 and the audi. it handled much better than the tl, es and is. the infiniti had similar handling. and the 328 had better ergonomics for a 6-3 guy and better highway gas mileage/emissions than all the other car. as another poster mentioned, the 328/325 has better consumer reports repair ratings than audi and c300 and the same ratings as the japanese car, except for the land yacht. i bought a three year used bmw for about 50% off original msrp. i got over the image. the bad one that is. "
smarty666,September 2010," again, no body looks at all the post and picks and choose what they want to nit pick on; it is a fact, german automobiles cost more than their japanese counter parts with the same equipment, etc. im not saying nor did i say that was a bad thing, its just the way it is. all i ever mentioned was the word prestige and how that contributes a lot to german luxury sales. i did say that was not the sole and only reason that people buy german vehicles but many on here seem to have missed that. i even mentioned bmw performance/handling as a key factor in conjunction with the bmw badge as reasons why they are so successful. you as well have strong conclusions claiming ""facts"" about the bmw without any data. dont get me wrong, the bmw is a great car but, it doesnt have better honda or highway gas mileage then all those other vehicles you test drove and i find it hard to believe it has the best ergonomics for a tall person considering there are other vehicles in that class with more front headroom then the 328 where when your taller, headroom makes the most difference. not saying the bmw is a bad car, it certainly has several pros over some of the other entry-level lux sedan but not in those areas you mentioned. bmw 19/28 mpg (f/r headroom 38.5/37.5)infiniti 19/27mpg (f/r headroom 39.1""/37.2"")audi 22/30mpg (f/r headroom 40.0/37.5)c300 18/26mpg (f/r headroom 37.1/36.9) tl 18/26mpg (f/r headroom 38.4/36.7) is250 21/30mpg (f/r headroom 37.2/36.7)es350 19/27mpg (f/r headroom 37.8/37.0)im not saying i only get japanese luxury vehicles because that couldnt be further from the truth. ive had acura, infiniti, mercedes, and a caddy so far. unless acura changes direction, ill most likely be shopping infiniti, lexus, bmw, and audi the next time around. "
murphydog,September 2010," every thing you just described here also related to buying an acura over a honda or hyundai or nissan....find that you like your acura - but wow, talk about the kettle calling the pot black... "
sweendogy,September 2010," edwards i agree about the facts statement-- poor job in this and other tl related chats getting real facts. for a laugh read the 2009 + tl chat room-- its full of how fast the tl is verse other car, how it handles, and other fluff pieces (im banned from that chat) - fact the 3 series (no matter what the stigma or price) is still the standard in the entry level lux group.. i think its a fantastic car myself and would of bot one but decided the extra 10-15k (i have a pontiac5x) wasnt worth it (vs 335xi) for my needs. i think all car in this group are good choices... but for performance its 3 series (335) then g from there you go down the line (in no particular order) and its prob is350, 328, tlawd, c350, and catty 3.6.. and further down the line is (no order again) audi, cc, satoyota, is250, es350, tl fwd, acura, infiniti, caddy 2.8, suzuki.. "
smarty666,September 2010," while that is true, nissan, hyundai, honda, etc are not luxury companies so its puzzling why they would be brought up here; any luxury company in this country is going to have more prestige or what ever you want to call it from the mainhonda parent company. i like the acura i have, but nothing really from their current product line. that is not new news and not the first time ive mentioned it on here. "
edwardsf,September 2010," easy now. the main message you have been communicating in many of your posts is the following: ""prestige and how that contributes a lot to german luxury sales."" and over and over. but... you cite no data to support that oft repeated claim. that is my point. not the other strawmen you bring up. and what exactly is a ""strong"" conclusion? i made some statements such as the ergonomics are better for a 6-3 guy than the other car. um, okay. i got in the car and moved the seat around. i fit in the bmw much better than any of the car, including the audi, which i actually owned. so, the manufacturers specs are relatively meaningless. for all its warts, cr does try to deal with the manufacturer discrepancies by trying to compensate for them. but even cr does not account for sloping roof tops, which hinder vision. i take it you dont have that issue of being a big guy ....which brings us to big highway mpg. thanks for all your googling of stats but i dont think they help this connissantion, the point of which is to share experiences and go beyond the manufacturer and epa dynometer specs. if you look on fuelconomy.gov or at edmunds self reporting responses, bmw get remarkable highway mileage - and mind you, these are bmw drivers who drive fast. the 328, 528 and even 535/335s are almost acuraary for getting 29-33 mpg going 70 mph. i averaged 29 mpg going from sb to sf doing about 72 mph. sure, these are self reporting and anecdotal but the number of them certainly helped convinced me and my experience confirmed them. again, that is what these forums are for. also, your mpg numbers use 2 pretty suspect models. the audi fwd, which is [non-permissible content removed] due to the fuel saving cvt and the slow, remarkably cdodgeped, toyota-like is250. btw, my post starts off referencing your apparent mission (bmw are for prestige hungry wannabees) but mainly, i just wanted some buyers to take a look at my personal experiences. have a glass of wine or something (after you drive that nose heavy tl, that is....) "
edwardsf,September 2010," yes, performance wise, the g and the 3 series seemed much better to me than the rest. i did not test the higher end 335, is350, c350 or tlawd as they seemed a bit pricey to me and the gas mileage on all, except the 335 was pretty bad. i dont need awd. so we all have our own needs, which puts us into different markets. i had never thought about it before but the tl drivers do seem to be a bit combative. i think this thread has a huge tl vs. g battle in past years. i actually like both car (i considered both in 2 car purchases) and think that many people would be happy with either. i think the g and 3 series are a little more engaging to drive but every once in a while, i pine for a slightly smoother car - maybe like a tl or c300. i never pine for a gm, suzuki or toyota.... "
sweendogy,September 2010, smarty you just got worked.. lets hope billy posts something quick to cover this page up.. 
smarty666,September 2010," i find it laughable that when i do post actual facts and stats that do not support inaccurate claims of the bmw superiority in certain areas, like mpg for instance, excuses are used as to why those competitor models get either better or the same fuel mpg then the bmw or puts them down regardless; the bmw is not the best fuel economy vehicle in its class and just about matches the competition at best: though the bmw is most likely the best in the category for acceleration, handling, and performance oriented capabilities; each vehicle has advantages and disadvantages to its competitors, it just depends on what fits your needs and wants the best; what disappointing now is that i have provided stats which are simply brushed off as not being able to go by what the manufacturers of their own vehicles put out so whats the point of providing stats if they are just going to be dismissed; it seems hypocritical and a waste of my time thenanyone today can beat window sticker epa toyotates in real world experiences and ive done it on my last 5 vehicles so that means that under ideal driving conditions and location any of those entry-level lux vehicles can be exceeded in those numbers on real world conditions or lowered if conditions are not idealapparently by saying that a lot of bmw and mb sales are due to the prestige factor has offended some or they would not be making a big deal of it. i have toyota before there is nothing wrong with that and im not trying to put them down based on it; bmw, mb, and lexus would not be where they are if it was not for a long, proud, prestigious htoyotaory in this country and they have rightly earned that reputation; maybe it all has to do with the word ""a lot"" - maybe it would have been better to say ""some"", i dont know. apparently im some acura fan boy who hates all german vehicles; he must of miss the part when i toyota ive had a mb before and im planning on shopping german the next time around; i must be shopping on the prestige factor as well then :p "
billyperks2,September 2010," i am starting to like you.almost forgot, tons of compliments just keep raining in on my white diamond pearl tl awd. this gentleman at church told me to take good care of his car (meaning my car).as another poster would say-happy motoring!!! "
edwardsf,September 2010," i asked you for data to support your long series of posts adamently claiming that a big reason people buy german car is for prestige. you then supplied the data for headroom. huh? then i refute your data by stating that manufacturer space spec discrepancies are well known and you sound like i took your candy away. please try reading the actual posts and responding to the actual text of the posts. it make the thread go better. for instance, if i say the 328 has better highway mpg than the other car in its class, you are not responding to that statement by saying ""the bmw is not the best fuel economy vehicle in its class."" that is what is called a strawman. since you do it repeatedly, i doubt i can convince you to stop but i will try anyway. i did not refer to overall fuel economy as honda mpg was not important to me in my purchase. i, like a lot of other people, drive very little honda miles as i walk or ride my bike to work. if i say that the car you selectively posted are not a good representation of the 328 competitors, you are not responding to my post by saying ""those competitor models get either better or the same fuel mpg then the bmw or puts them down regardless."" first, i dont know what the heck that sentence means and second, my statement stands unrefuted. but if you want putdowns, here is one for you: the is250 is blingy scion tc. please dont compare it to the 3 series. also, i agree that no one cares about ones anecdotal experiences in beating the epa numbers. however, people do seem to care about the dozens of reports from owners that could amount to some cumulative evidence about the real world operation of the vehicle that they are considering. (the epa numbers are helpful for emissions though.) i do agree with one line in your post: ""apparently im some acura fan boy who hates all german vehicles;"" "
ivan_99,September 2010, on a side note...my wife used my is350 for her church ladies weekend...now it makes a squeaky sound.sounds like a bearing...or something.doesnt sound sporty or luxurious.luckily the wild pig she claimed ran out and hit the side of her mini-van didnt get my is...that darned pig left a white paint streak :surprise: 
sweendogy,September 2010," did you give your dad a ride home?? joking, good for you billy - you must keep it nice... "
plekto,September 2010," my real issue with the 3 series is that its now a seriously overweight and misguided vehicle when you compare it to its roots. it just is a very fancy and plush ""sedan"". now, it might be among the best in its class, but thats a lot like the ""class"" that includes car like a toyota and honda. being the best of bland isnt what i want. and neither is ""overweight and boring euro sedan"".if you want a real sport sedan experience, you need three components(manual is a given):1 - rwd2 - inline engine, preferably an i-6 or turbo 4 180-200hp minimum.3 - curb weight under 3000lbs. preferably 2800.nothing on the market fits this, though a few coupes and roadsters do. but just under 3600lbs is entirely in the wrong universe. "
shipo,September 2010," the problem is that, in this era of airbags, anti-crush passenger zones, and gizmo packed car, i seriously doubt any company could build your ""real sport sedan"" for an affordable price.fwiw #1, the 2011 bmw weighs in at 3,362 pounds, only 165 pounds more than my 1999 bmw. not too shatoyotay.fwiw #2, the last time a bmw sedan with an i6 engine weighed 3,000 or less was 1991 (although the 1992 tipped the scales at 3,021 lbs.).fwiw #3, given that the much more capable 2011 bmw weighs only 341 pounds more than the 1992 325i, i think bmw did a pretty good job at packaging all of the new safety requirements, structural integrity and extra size. personally if i was given the option of the 1992 or the 2011, id choose the 2011 every time (although i would almost immediately chuck the rfts in favor of a good set of gfts, a move that will knock another 25 pounds of weight off the car). best regards,shipo "
qbrozen,September 2010," not to mention...92 = 15.98lbs/hp and 16.69lbs/ft-lb. peak torque 4700rpm. mileage 19mpg average.11 = 14.62lbs/hp and 16.81lbs/ft-lb. peak torque 2750rpm. mileage 22mpg average.and while i dont have the data to back it up, im pretty confident in saying a stock 11 would whoop a stock 92 around any track, even with the extra 300lbs. progress aint always a bad thing.now, dont get me wrong. i hate weight, too. just cant have it all for a reasonable price, though. "
rayainsw,September 2010," &#145;. . . almost immediately chuck the rfts in favor of a good set of gfts, a move that will knock another 25 pounds of weight off the car).&#146;have you driven a 2011?not having driven a 335 since i bought what i have now, i was rather impressed with the ride in 2 bmw [ coupes ] that i have recently driven &#150; both with 19&#148; runflats. i have read that the dampers were changed. the ride was quite acceptable &#150; and noticeably better than i recall from driving 2009s.- rayjust one data point . . . "
shipo,September 2010," the point is that no matter how much better the suspension gets at dealing with the extra unsprung weight of the rfts, the ride and handling of the car will significantly improve by putting substanitally lighter gfts on the car; and to a lesser degree, the acceleration and braking will improve as well. "
rayainsw,September 2010, agreed.does the 3 have a well in the trunk for a full sized spare? 
shipo,September 2010," nope, but the well looks large enough for a couple of cans of goo.  "
smarty666,September 2010," i provided facts about the bmw not having the best highway mpg; by the way, those vehicles are the bmw competitors in price, features, size in some cases, etc if you do not think so then you do not know the entry-lux segment well at all: you can come up with all the excuses why your right but guess what, no one cares you can use all the personal anecdotes you want from your own personal experience for mpg but what comes down to comparing between vehicles is what the epa and manufacturers say their fuel ratings are: why dont you provide a link about manufacturer discrepancies in mpg; i think its a bunch of bull b/c if anything, in the last 10 years, the epa and manufacturer mpg toyotates have gotten pretty accurate a cross the board, compared to before that time, and ive seen this pretty constoyotaently suptoyota on all the personal avgs ive seen people report on the various auto boards i belong to; if you dont want to believe that, its your own problem. you cant say that no one car about personal reports of peoples mpg experiences but then its okay to take the numbers retoyota personally from a group of a few dozen or a few hundreds, which is what your saying; its still not that big of a population size compared to the tens of thousands or hundred of thousand owners of these vehiclesthere is no need to provide links and stats for my statement about prestige being a factor in bmw and mb purchases. this is real easy but you seem to not understand nor would i provide links since your going to just dismiss them and thus waste my time. 1) german vehicles have lower resale values then their japanese counterparts (look at alg for that one) 2) on a whole, the german manufacturers still do not have the long-term reliability and less problem their japanese counterparts have on average (look at cr long-term reliability htoyotaory charts specifically). can also say, the chance of getting a problem littered german vehicle is still slightly higher than the chance of getting a problem littered japanese vehicle3) similar equipped bmw/mb and japanese vehicles do not cost the same amount with the germans having a few thousand price premium (just build them on each website with same equipment to find this out) those 3 facts indicate that, similarly equipped japanese vs german luxury vehicles are giving the japanese a better financial decision to get. but, there are a lot of people not choosing the japanese vehicle and opting for the more expensive, more depreciating, higher chance possibility of problem littered german vehicle. some people making that decision have to be doing based on the prestige/ reputation factor that mb and bmw have. now, as you conveniently leave out every post you respond to and dont say, ive toyota time and time again, not all people are making that decision based on prestige, though you are trying to make it out that is what im saying; ive toyota before, some are making that decision for other reasons, like performance advantage, luxury toyota factors, etc but prestige is a factor. maybe its not called prestige, maybe its called something else, you can make up your own word, i dont care, just get over it. again, you took my comment out of context that i toyota at the end of my post to try and make it appear im anti-german and that couldnt be further from the truth "
roadburner,September 2010," if you want a real sport sedan experience, you need three components(manual is a given):1 - rwd2 - inline engine, preferably an i-6 or turbo 4 180-200hp minimum.3 - curb weight under 3000lbs. preferably 2800.my 318ti club sport comes close; 2700 lbs. and 150 bhp. in a few years im going to fit a stroker motor that will up the power to around 220 bhp. i have to say i really like light tossable car- my old 2002 may be a tad bit slow but with less than 2400 lbs. to carry around it is a real blast on a winding road. "
fedlawman,September 2010," ""those 3 facts indicate that, similarly equipped japanese vs german luxury vehicles are giving the japanese a better financial decision to get.""the problem i see with this statement is that they are not similarly equipped.i know youre talking about heated this, and bluetooth that, but much of the value in a european car is not in the bells and whtoyotales, its in the engineering.i can go to kmart and buy a wood veneer dining room set for $500 that looks and functions a lot like a $2000 ethan allen set. which one is the better value?i guess it all comes down to how much ""value"" one places in having an in-line 6 engine, superb steering feel, and near-perfect chassis balance vs. 19"" wheels, ipod acuration, and a 30gb hard drive.i know which features i prefer...and, by the way, the days of the true ""sport sedan"" are long gone and not coming back. but this thread isnt about sport sedan anyways - its about entry-level luxury sport sedan. big difference. mentioning sport sedan in this thread is simply off-topic. "
tlong,September 2010," i just lament the growth in size of these vehicles. i have an 05 tl and it is bigger than i like. my next car is going to be smaller. imho the new acura is also way too big. i had a 98 audi and it was just fabulous. but even that car has bloated up. i know it is ot, but have you seen the ugliness and the increased size of the new volkswagen? omg. :surprise: "
murphydog,September 2010," i have only been reviewing this thread for a short time but i find this statement interesting...""those 3 facts indicate that, similarly equipped japanese vs german luxury vehicles are giving the japanese a better financial decision to get""if you are only looking dollars and cents, then a honda provides what your acura does at a lower pricethis whole line of bantering is silly any way - the best car is each of our opinion. i have had my car over 2 years now and it puts a smile on my face every morning - as long as your car puts a smile on your face each morning, then in fact you have the best car. "
plekto,September 2010," well, the 180hp was considering a 3000lb weight. the mazda does hit these numbers as does a first generation nissan with manual(oddly enough), so making a car this size thats this light isnt impossible. ill trade a few hundred pounds of padding and sound insulation and fluff any day for handling. shoot, my old truck is so loud you cant hear yourself hardly think. i think part of it is that bmw and mercedes and the rest are stressing cocoon-like isolation over performance.my favorite sports sedan from the ""classic"" era was the 1983 volvo 242 group-a turbo(""flathood""). i sat in one about 20 years back and was shocked at how fast it moved. i mean, compared to stuff like a chevrolet doing 8 or 10 seconds, it ran like a fire was under its rear end. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tghogwvj1nc&feature=relatedalmost 30 years old and why cant we get at least this good today, given modern materials and technology? remember, this car cost 18k or so back then. so even adjusted for inflation, its the same price as a base 3 series today. "
fedlawman,September 2010," this is exactly why e30s are still so popular and in demand, and why so many enthusiasts who got excited about the 1-series were ultimately so disappointed by it.im waiting, but i still havent found a worthy successor for my e30 bmw. as long as i can get parts for it, im keeping it. "
cdnpinhead,September 2010," imho the new acura is also way too big.i absolutely agree, which is why im so pleased to have slipped in just under the wire to buy one of the last of the previous versions -- besides which, it has no beak. "
pv2,September 2010," im keeping my 2007 tl-s because it handles very well due to its lighter weight vs. the ""beaky"" new tl. handles great and am averaging 21 mpg long term. also, acceleration is better than even the 305hp sh-awd. "
smarty666,September 2010," that was what i was talking about, similarly equipped vehicles, same options, equipment, features, engine sizes, etc and it is possible to build a german and japanese vehicle pretty similarly with equipment, the only difference is going to be the total price on the window. i do agree with you about the value of german engineering and as i mentioned before, that is definitely a factor when purchasing one of their vehicles for many people, myself included. i would have not tried that mercedes a few years ago if it wasnt. at least in my case, prestige did play a part in getting that mb because in conjunction with the luxury precision toyota mbs are known for. it except for 2 things covered under warranty, i really enjoyed that mb and it sure the heck was more reliable then the caddy i had. "
smarty666,September 2010," have to agree with most of what you say. my whole point is that it comes down to choices in the luxury market and as you pointed out yourself, it all comes down to what each persona personally is looking for in a luxury vehicle. if it is the best bang for your buck (financially) then its going to be japanese vehicle, if its fine tuned mechanical and performance engineering its going to be a german vehicle and so on and so on depending on the specific features and charactertoyotaics your looking for. "
fedlawman,September 2010," ""that was what i was talking about, similarly equipped vehicles, same options, equipment, features, engine sizes, etc and it is possible to build a german and japanese vehicle pretty similarly with equipment, the only difference is going to be the total price on the window.""my point is that you cannot get them ""similarly equipped."" you cannot get an acura or infinity with an in-line 6 engine. the vq is a thrashy mess, and the acura v6 is fine, but its no inline.now the i-4 in the acura is a sweet engine - especially when mated to their excellent 6-speed manual. if it had been rwd, id probably still be driving it... "
gbosil,October 2010," bmw and mercedes are ""taxies"" in europe. i rest my case. :p i dont see any acura taxies running around here in the states! "
shipo,October 2010, and your point is? 
Kirstie_H,October 2010," that europe has really nice taxis, and people there like to get where theyre going... fast. (it shouldnt be surprising considering those are european manufacturers, and acura isnt.) "
alltorque,October 2010," and the vast majority, (if not all), of those bmw and mercedes taxis are, of course, diesels.. the mercedes e300d is a particular favourite with brussels taxi drivers, (from memory), and they are really rather quick............""time is money, msieur and the fare is the same whether it takes 10 minutes or 20 minutes. so..............""fun days and dicing with the tdodges was a great way to become fully alert on the way to the office of a morning. "
shipo,October 2010," hmmm, ive ridden in many-many taxi cab in europe and id say that only a little over half are diesel. in paris im thinking the number is closer to 90%, in munich maybe only 30% to 40%. toyota another way, it varies ddodgeatically depending upon where you are.as for being nice and fast, yup, i rode in a brand spankin new e320d a few years ago from the 8th arrondissement to cdg at about five in the morning. the catoyotaie was justifiably proud of his new ride and absolutely nailed it when we got on the p?riphertoyotaue; we were moving north of 160 kph (100 mph) in no time.  "
billyperks2,October 2010," beak is good- it intimidates the car in front of you, also its my favorite part of the car to put on my zaino shine.:) "
pv2,October 2010," many european taxis that ive ridden in (mercedes, etc.) are deisels, but some are also seriously de-contented to keep the price down (vinyl seat, etc.). the german brands promote an upscale image in the us and only ship their luxury versions here; the ones at home need to be competitive with mid-range car in germany. "
gbosil,October 2010," let me re-phrase... what i ment was... in japan ""acura"" are not taxies and toyota are  basically there used to be a prestige about bmw and mercedes years ago only a select few individuals ""accomplished"" individuals could afford one... today they are a dime a dozen and mass produced. i see them everywhere. if you want to spend 17k more on a bmw vs the tl-shawd just to say "" hey look at me i drive a bimmer"" go ahead you fool! thats you own perog. as soon as you dive it off the lot its now worth 49k vs 60k and the depreciation on a bmw is just wicked! i just test drove the new 2011 5 series at my local bmw dealer... not impressed with the 60k+ price tag and ride quality. in fact the new look doesnt impress me either. just cant justify it over a acura or lexus in terms of reliability, value, resale and similar quality. the germans still have many electrical problem to sort out. read consumer reports talk to people who own them. oh... and by the way.. check their labor rates! yikes!!!!!! :surprise: "
shipo,October 2010," dude, there are no acura in japan. why? because acura is exclusive to north america. that toyota, a number of years ago i rode in a ""honda acura"" taxi in osaka, a car that was identical to the acura acura of its day here in the u.s.as for calling folks ""fools"", if you want a flame war, keep it up. personally i wouldnt be caught dead in a tl-shawd, its a nose heavy sled for poseurs. you want a real car, stop looking at acura.there, back atcha. :p "
gbosil,October 2010," ltoyotaen. you are wrong. there are acura in japan i was just there in tokyo and saw quite a few running around. sorry to strike a nerve... not here to start any war just making my point heard under ""free speeech and my opinon."" bmw and mercedes are nothing but mass produced car... period.  "
Kirstie_H,October 2010," ""free speech""? were you under the impression that you have a constitutional guarantee of ""free speech"" on these forums? just a question....and no, we arent going to start a war, at least not one that gets personal. that doesnt work for us. "
shipo,October 2010," there may be acura in japan but they werent sold there. to date, honda has yet to market the acura brand in japan, that toyota, they have expanded the brand to include mexico, hong kong, and china.as for bmw and mercedess being ""mass-produced"", so? whats your point? all car with the exception of a few exotics are ""mass-produced""; the difference is that some companies imbue their car with better design and engineering than others. with the lone exceptions of the honda and the s2000, ive yet to see a honda product that measures up (class for class) to any mercedes or bmw. "
roadburner,October 2010, and to think that ive wasted the past 27 years driving bmw- when all that time i could have been driving re-badged honda...  
smarty666,October 2010, the i4 in the acura is a loud obnoxious engine which gets piss pour mpg for an engine its size and displacement when there are i4s coming out now with the same and even better gas mileage then the acura i4 and ones that dont sound like a v8 engine at idle; acura really needs to begin working on their i4 engines because they are behind in their game compared to everyone else in that department among others sure you can get them similar equipped i guess youve just failed to try and build them properly the only thing that is wrong with the vq is its noise level at idle sometimes; it is one of the best performance oriented engine ive ever had and still kills the acura v6s for performance and acceleration!. might becoming to an end though if mb has its way in the partnership. 
jimbres,October 2010,"  the germans still have many electrical problem to sort out. read consumer reports talk to people who own them. i have an 01 bmw 330i that i bought in june of that year - more than 9 years ago - & ive had exactly zero electrical problem to date.also, im looking at the 2010 consumer reports auto issue as i write this. (ive subscribed to cr for over 30 years, btw.) cr rates the bmw bmw as ""better than average"" & the bmw as ""average"". (the 5 gets a lower rating because of problem with its sound system.) for both car, cr rates the core systems - engine, cooling, transmission, fuel & electrical - as either ""better than average"" or ""much better than average"". in fact, the frequency of repair ratings for late-model bmw 3s are just about identical to those for recent acura tls.  oh... and by the way.. check their labor rates! yikes!!!!!! i dont know about you, but after the factory warranty expires, i dont go back to the dealer. why would anyone do that? i use an excellent independent mechanic, who takes care of my wifes lexus, my bmw & our honda honda. so i can say quite truthfully that i dont pay a higher labor rate for my bmw than i do for our 2 japanese car. "
gbosil,October 2010, no... i realize that. ha ha ha . . . just stirring the pot a bit... i guess it worked! :surprise: 
gbosil,October 2010," huh... :confuse: interesting... got my 2010 consumer reports car buying guide in front of me right now.... see an awful lot of black dots for bmw.... hummmm lookin over at the acura side wow to my surprise an awful lot of reds! cr best buys and recommended tl, acura, acura . .. . etc........................... "
billyperks2,October 2010," ""i have an 01 bmw 330i that i bought in june of that year - more than 9 years ago - & ive had exactly zero electrical problem to date. ""consider yourself lucky.my co-worker has the 330xi and that car literally calls the dealer its second home. "
cdnpinhead,October 2010," can beat up your dad. great to be back in middle school, or 4th grade, or whatever. . .didnt realize that the acura i4 that i drive is only one step away from a threshing machine.live and learn.ive only driven 1.3 million miles. "
roadburner,October 2010, didnt realize that the acura i4 that i drive is only one step away from a threshing machine.look on the bright side; it seems ive been driving taxis at hpdes since 1988... :p 
jimbres,October 2010, perhaps if you cleaned your glasses... 
jimbres,October 2010," id say that your co-worker is unlucky, which can happen with any make.the e46 bmw car have been quite reliable overall. several of my friends & co-workers own them & have had good experiences with them. "
fedlawman,October 2010," ""ive been driving taxis at hpdes since 1988""whats the fare? i think id like a ride in your cab... "
edwardsf,October 2010," """"i just see all those black and red dots."" i dont think its a coloring book. if you actually scrutinize all those round red and black dot thingies - which sounds like it may be a bit too much trouble for you - you will find that the 328 and 528 have better than average ratings. as people have pointed out, even the more troublesome 335/535s have few well below average marks besides the stereo and heater or something. ""just cant justify it over a acura or lexus in terms of reliability, value, resale and similar quality."" who in the world would want to? sports sedan are to go fast around corners in. why would you buy them for ""value?"" you want value, get a honda. oh, wait. you did. "
edwardsf,October 2010," ""there is no need to provide links and stats for my statement about prestige being a factor in bmw and mb purchases."" right, that is my point. you keep raging on about something but arent willing to research or cant prove it but just keep repeating it anyway.

""have to be?"" what are you captain jean luc picard? just because you say so, does not make it so. you still provide no data to support your conclusion that people buy bmw for prestige. i am glad you mention some factors that you use for your conclusion but your conclusion is, unfortunately, baseless b/c you are comparing apples to oranges in preferences. as fedlawman points out, bmw buyers buy bmw for their inline 6s, handling, and transmissions. you and other tl owners buy a sports luxury car for ""value"" and ""resale.""

"
bimmer4me,October 2010," my 2008 bmw, warts and all. :p "
ivan_99,October 2010," i would agree that people buy just for the prestige.a vehicle or manufacturer with prestige would be: ""standing or toyotation in the eyes of people : weight or credit in general opinion""so, for the most part a vehicle/manufacturer has to earn that prestige...when we go test drive we determine if they live up to it.so, some people are lazy...they look at a vehicles reputation (prestige)...and buy.one vehicle may have a reputation for being sporty...another for reliability.buying a vehicle because it has a reputation for reliability is no more noble than buying a vehicle because it is sporty or luxurious. i know our ceo and cio both purchased their lexus lss because it is ""supposed"" to be reliable...they didnt do exhaustive test drives or pour over long term reliability reports.i currently own a lexus. i didnt buy it because of its prestige...i actually prefer many volkswagens models over lexus.way back, i drove a late 90s (maybe 2000) 3 series...think 323 and was disappointed. i thought ""i was expecting more..."". i drove an es300...and thought a volkswagen volkswagen was far superior.difficult thing about a reputation is its hard to change quickly. people still flock to toyota (if i hear bullet proof in reference to toyota reliability again ill put a bullet in my head...well maybe not...but ill be really annoyed).audi has a bad reputation for reliability; the ones ive owned were less trouble than the lexus or honda ive owned...although non of them were ""bad"".its all good  "
gbriank,October 2010," if youd like to be more ""untoyotaue"", may i recommend a saab. there not ""everywhere"" nor ""mass produced"". now whether or not the company is solvent, that remains to be seen. untoyotaue, yes. reliable, probably not. "
gbriank,October 2010," how long have you owned these vehicles? (audi, lexus, etc....just curious) "
smarty666,October 2010," ""you keep raging on about something but arent willing to research or cant prove it but just keep repeating it anyway""you just dont get it, i did provide the three factors making up the prestige decision in some of bmw and mb purchases so you of course missed that as usual. alg residual value awards, cr long term reliability chart data (im talking for the previous model years, not the average or above avg ratings that they have given just two of bmw models for the last 2 years. there are much more black dots on bmw, audi, and mb then there is for acura, lexus, and infiniti, im talking 4 or 5+ years here, not when the car are still new and under warranty. and the cost factor of similarly equipped vehicles built on each manufacturers website. so there is the lack of proof your complaining about. ive told you the sites, where to look and what to do, not my fault your sitting there with your hands over your eyes acting ignorant. ""okay - here are the links. not so hard, eh? but first, your attn span is really limited. i mentioned manufacturer discrepancies for space figures not mpg. no one takes manufacturers space numbers seriously. regarding epa mpg numbers, it is pretty unanimous among testers and the epa itself that the epa dynometer testing is inaccurate.""wow talk about limited attention spans, you actually were talking about epa mpg discrepancies/inaccuracies now your complaining about space figures. give me a break, your so full of it youll say and do anything to prove your 3 year old bmw is gods gift to man. it does not have the best highway mpg nor the most room of the entry-level lux sedan in its class. get over it. great, epa figures are completely inaccurate and most people can get even better than that if they want to so if others vehicles can get better than their epa then that means they still can get better mpg then the bmw since they are rated higher to begin with. just because you and few dozen or few hundred sample size of the bmw have gotten great mpg doesnt mean all the hundreds of thousands of bmw owners are and thus proves nothing. you make yourself look ridiculous that when i post actual stats to disprove your grandiose claims you spend all your time squirming around it by ""oh this is inaccurate, that is inaccurate, oh you cant go by this, me and a bunch of other people got this, etc. excuse, excuse, excuse! now we cant go by manufacturer space figures, c-mon :sick: "" but i know how you can get over german car envy. sell the nose heavy tl and buy a bimmer. there see, i can be helpful""why would i need to do that since i dont even have the new nose heavy tl nor do i like that car to begin with :confuse: i guess ill never get over my german car envy since i guess the mb in my driveway isnt considered a german car :surprise: "
604doc,October 2010, has this discussion turned into cheese yet? you guys have been milking it long enough... :p

"
smarty666,October 2010," here are the facts in the great japanese vs german luxury debate! 1) japanese vehicles have higher residual values then german vehicles still 2) the chance of getting a problem littered german vehicle is still higher than a japanese one and a higher chance of having more expensive/numerous long-term reliability issues3) when similarly built up with the same size engine, features, content, navigation, etc the german vehicles cost a few thousand more than their japanese counterparts these are all facts suptoyota by various websites, cr, alg, manufacturers own websites, among others. im not saying there is anything wrong with these facts. there are many reasons to getting german over japanese, mechanical and performance charactertoyotaics being just one, but if someone knows those 3 facts mentioned above and still chooses the german luxury vehicle over the japanese luxury vehicle then some are making the decision based on some factor other than financial reasons or just sport performance, luxury features, etc. its because of the name and brand definition of bmw and mb. there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. that was part of the reason i got my mb those years ago you can give a name to what ever that factor/reason is, i call it prestige. call it what you want. i just cant for the life of me believe there are people on here who do not believe brand recognition/prestige is not a buying factor for many people when getting a bmw or mb. :confuse: "
tlong,October 2010, lets not forget:- most european vehicles handle better than their japanese competition- most european luxury makes have nicer interiors than their japanese competitionjust to stay balanced.  
jimbres,October 2010," residual values really only matter if youre a short-termer: you lease or you buy & trade frequently. for those of us who keep our car for a while - ive had my bmw for over 9 years & will keep it for at least another year - residuals play little or no role in the buying decision.as far as reliability/repair frequency is concerned, the asian vehicles have the edge but the germans - particularly bmw - are closing the gap. "

shipo,October 2010," im thinking the only engine ever made that might go 400,000 miles with no oil changes is the old chrysler 225 slant-six. oh! and the lexus engine of course. :pthen again, once the chevroletplug tube seals and that looong valve cover gasket dried out and cracked, the 225 would need a quart of oil every several hundred miles just to replace what got through the seals.  "
fedlawman,October 2010," well, technically, thats just adding oil, not changing it... "
shipo,October 2010," maybe it should be called a ""rolling oil change"". :p "
sweendogy,October 2010," by my count 2011 is a year that brings nothing really new.. the new volvo ""naughty volvo"" kind of cool i guess but its not going to win in performance. lexus is has new commercials that talk about its new performance package but its the same car... the g changed the front end a bit for 2010, but nothing has really changed-- i guess the new performance line is kind of cool but the sedan is not part of it... the caddy has no changes planed, acura tl will have to wait until 2012 for the nose job but nothing in the blood work..audi looks like they dropped the v6 option for the audi. bmw has new ""s"" models but again the sedan not involved in the changes.. any thoughts?? "
xlu,October 2010," here are the facts in the great japanese vs german luxury debate! 1) japanese vehicles have higher residual values then german vehicles still 2) the chance of getting a problem littered german vehicle is still higher than a japanese one and a higher chance of having more expensive/numerous long-term reliability issues 3) when similarly built up with the same size engine, features, content, navigation, etc the german vehicles cost a few thousand more than their japanese counterparts all these fit the descriptions of any appliance....here are some facts about german car;1) they handle better; the car is part of the driver; it goes where the driver wants to go; the driver feels what car is doing.2) they give passion to the drivers. i only see my wife smiling while driving a bmw, any bmw, in all the test drive events.3) they look better from outside; tight body, short overhang, creative curves.4) they look better from inside; tasteful usage of wood, metal, color and texture.5) they have higher prestige.in short, the japanese car are for people who just want a tool from point a to point b. german car are for people who love to drive to any points in style. "
gbriank,October 2010," 1) id have to agree. bmw has the best handling car out there (better than an acura...and ive owned two...tl and rl).2) not sure about passion, but definitely allows the driver to push the limits while driving with confidence3) designs are more evolutionary than revolutionary, but thats not a bad thing.4) in my opinion, bmw interiors are very sedate and understated. my only gripe is the radio system. without having read the manual, i challenge anyone new to bmw to figure out how to change the radio station.5) living in dallas, bmw are everywhere! prestige factor is lower here. "
ivan_99,October 2010, im on the lexus now (1.5 years)...i usually dont keep them long. i have the intention to...but then something comes up where i decide a change is needed. the audi (audi) duration was 2.5years or so; an audi was in there as well...was only 1.5 years duration.although i do have a mini-van since 2005...probably will keep it for another 5 years... 
smarty666,October 2010, cant argue with any of that!  
smarty666,October 2010," i would agree with you on points 1 and 2 for the most part but not on 3, 4, and 5. there are japanese offerings from at least 1 of the 3 companies that can match the germans in points 3, 4, and 5. lexus definitely has the prestige factor or so many people would not flock to them month after month for most of their products have such souless driving. i feel the same way about mb but they do a little bit better job of not making the drive as boring as lexus does but do not come close to audi, infiniti, or bmw when it comes to driving toyotamics and sport performance. infiniti gives passion for the driver, but if you have never had one you would not know that. ive raced many bmw in my time with my infiniti and have beaten many of them. its a really fun to drive and i smile a lot when in it so there are japanese vehicles that offer that passion and fun factor for the driver. in regards to point 3, infiniti has really nice looking vehicles, tight bodies, and many sporty curves to them. bmw used to really lack in this area until the new 3 and 5 series which finally have some nice curves in their body styles and i quite like the looks of both of them now on the outside. audi body styles are really nice as well. in regards to point 4, the only german make who has a gorgeous interior is audi. bmw is still on the plain side with little textures, color in their interiors and just are functional. luckily they use high quality materials and little plastic which helps the blahness and makes the interiors livable and presentable. mb is using too much plastic like acura does now on the interiors which is disappointing and a turn off for me. the new m from infiniti has a really nice textured/high quality interior which competes finally on par with the germans. lexus has nice/high quality interiors as well depending on the model you get. there are plenty of japanese vehicles that are for people who love to drive to any points in style, you just dont care to look for them. talk about a rash generalization. "
tlong,October 2010," in regards to point 4, the only german make who has a gorgeous interior is audi.imho mb interiors are much nicer than lexus. they also smell much richer, something about differences in the leather. "
plekto,October 2010," there are a few exceptions from time to time, though. the is300, for instance, was awesome when it was released. the is250/350 somehow lost that ""euro"" feel and magic to it. i think its more than just designing a car to handle well. i think its that bmw and mercedes know how to balance all of the factors so that none of them really stand out. ie - you get a solid b+ rating in everything and so it feels poised and has the same feel to it.a good analogy is a band. if one instrument stands out badly , it kind of ruins the thing. japan usually gets only a couple of areas wrong, and sometimes manages this balancing act. gm -well, theyre lucky if the band is in tune most days. :p "
tlong,October 2010," gm -well, theyre lucky if the band is in tune most days. they sometimes play really well, its just that the band has trouble getting through a song before one of the members goes unconscious from an overdose. :p "
smarty666,October 2010, perhaps but they dont use enough high quality materials like bmw and audi do constoyotaently throughout the cabin. ive found way to many cheap imitation plastic things in their vehicles when i test drove them which bothered me a lot. ive seen two or three reviews over the last few years slapping them a little bit on the amount of plastic as well. though the leather was really nice quality and toyotaable ill give mb that! 
fedlawman,October 2010," plekto is right.the is300 is a good example of a fine effort by lexus to build a bmw. for the most part, they did a good job - in-line 6, 5 speed mt, fun to drive, and sporty inside. at the same time, they missed a few little things that held the car back from becoming a hit with enthusiasts - the interior was cheap and gimmicky (chronograph instruments), it wasnt as quick as a comparable bmw 330i, and it was nose heavy.of course, the biggest problem with the is300 was sales. it didnt appeal to lexus shoppers. it wasnt quiet, luxurious, or elegant so it didnt sell well.a couple other opinions:gm makes the cadillac cts, which by all accounts is a fine car in this class. it compares well to any car in this category, and does well because it doesnt try to be all things to all people. it is what it is, and its proud of that.infinity is the closest japan gets to building a bmw in this class, but it lacks many of the things that bmw buyers want - a smooth and refined driveline being at the top of the ltoyota. i also think its wheelbase is too long and its too heavy.kind of off-topic, but the best recent examples of japanese sports car are the dearly departed honda s2000 and the mazda miata and mazda. these car are/were fantastic because they arent trying to beat bmw or be a ""japanese bmw contender."" they are great simply because they were built from the ground up to be great car. period. "
jimbres,October 2010,"  these car are/were fantastic because they arent trying to beat bmw or be a ""japanese bmw contender."" they are great simply because they were built from the ground up to be great car. period.excellent point - very hondaful post. i had never thought of the miata & the mazda that way, but i see now that youre right.a used miata can be a terrific value. a friend bought an 8-year-old miata for less than $3k some years ago & is having an indecent amount of fun with it. its not fast, but the handling is superb & the gearbox is almost as much fun as you-know-what. "
nyccarguy,October 2010," was also built to compete with the e36 bmw or maybe the early e46 bmw. the i6 was a smooth mill, but it wasnt that powerful (215 hp) and didnt get very good gas mileage for such a small car.it handled very well and was handsome once they tinted the taillights. the wheels were sharp & filled the wells quite nicely.it was ultimately too sharp, edgy, & rough for the traditional lexus buyer. it didnt perform well enough to wow the bmw crowd.there were actually a bunch of us bmw lovers back in late 05 that were eagerly awaiting the arrival of the 06 is because we thought lexus was so close with the 1st gen is that it would hit a home run with is version 2.0i happen to like the styling of the current is. the is 350 gets out if its own way, but the brakes are instant on and cannot be modulated. performance-wise, the is250 doesnt compete at all with a bmw. for the price of an is350, ill spend a few $$$ more and get a very nice n55 powered bmw which is available with 6-speed manual transmission. "
plekto,October 2010," like i toyota, they somehow missed that sweet spot. the infiniti, though, appears to be the magic combination, though. especially with the dodge package and wood trim. i think at 30k, its going to be a huge wake-up shot across everyones bow. my only hope is that infiniti figures out that its the right thing and not mess with it until its broken. "
nyccarguy,October 2010," no sport suspension, no stick shift, no nyccarguy. "
plekto,October 2010," sport suspension isnt really required, and i dont like super-harsh rides, but the omission of manual... oh lord, theyve just fallen on their face. so close and yet, someone in the board room is just a daft idiot. because in japan and europe, youll be able to get the manual version.seriously, what part of ""put your best foot forward"" isnt reaching these guys? its like gms buick. get rid of the base model corporate nonsense. get rid of the base trim, the puny base engine, and only offer your best example first. then offer a cheaper alternative in a year or so. you have to strike hard when the product is new and fresh. if all you hear(as gm did) is ""awesome, but the engine is pathetic"", by the time you get to doing it right, everyone will have passed on for better choices. "
smarty666,October 2010," was was a bigger disappointment for me on the infiniti is the lack of navigation and the fuel economy. how the heck does a infiniti, with an over 100hp reduction, have the same fuel economy as a rwd infiniti :confuse: :confuse: "
ivan_99,October 2010, the non awd shows 20/29...which is better than the 17/25 for the infiniti.better question is how does the v6 ford get 30 highway with almost +100 hp...if only ford had something a little more refined on par with this class. 
edwardsf,October 2010," wow, that is a lot of: ""get over it"" and ""you dont get it"" and ""give me a break"" in one post. why would i ever want links, cites or stats? ivan99 and a couple of other posters have some interesting comments about prestige as a factor and some are convincing. but i still think most people buy the car they like to drive. or as you would say, ""it is a fact people buy the car they like to drive.""btw, i would take a nose heavy tl over a mb anyday. mbs are very good looking but of course are very expensive, super costly to repair and are not nearly as fun to drive as bimmers, audi or infinities. but i guess - given your theme song - that people drive them because they think they are ""prestigious?"" "
ivan_99,October 2010," ""it is a fact people buy the car they like to drive."" im not certain it is a fact.we -- buy car we like to drive (of course speaking for you here  ).a large number of people in my corporate office buy car that have a good resale, have good reliability, look nice, have a good reputationthe way they drive (which im assuming means a well handling vehicle) is further down the ltoyota somewhere.of course i suppose if the vehicle meets the requirements above (resale, reliability etc)...theyd ""like to drive it""  "
edwardsf,October 2010, i loved the is300 and they had a wagon. this was another euroconcept that the is300 had that japanese car normally eschew. and i love wagons and long hatches. the 1st gen g20 was also a tossable little sport sedan - something like the 1993-5 era audi 4000. none of these three were rocket ships but then i dont buy car for that. i will take tossabilty and usable torque over raw stoplight takeoff power. but that is just me. 
edwardsf,October 2010," um,yeah. that was the point - my statement was an opinion and calling opinions ""facts"" is dumb. reread my post. i wrote, ""or as you would say...""on the point that you know people who do buy for resale, i thought that was just acura drivers.  seriously, i would buy a michevroletn for that but not a sport sedan and that is what i was referring to. "
smarty666,October 2010," thats not what im talking about. up here in the northeast, i would never buy just rwd vehicles b/c of the snow factor in the winter so its either fwd or awd. so im left with the awd option on a g if i were to get one. the fuel economy should be better than this with such a smaller engine in the vehicle and its size. i was hoping for 21/30mpg minimum but didnt even get that. to me, the way infiniti has it, there is no big advantage of getting the infiniti over the infiniti. mise well get the bigger oomph infiniti. awd infiniti is rated 19/27mpg rwd infiniti is rated 19/27mpg awd infiniti is rated 18/25mpg im left :confuse: "
smarty666,October 2010," we actually agree on somethings :surprise: :surprise:. i agree that many people buy the car they like to drive and one of the reasons some like to drive it, is b/c of the badge it has on the front end  . you be hard press to find bmw or mb drivers who would still think they would like to drive a vehicle with say a chevrolet or toyota emblem on them simply b/c they liked the way they drove. reason why i would not consider mb the next go around is for personal reasons. their vehicles are very luxurious/nice looking but both the c and e class have gotten way to close to the ground for my taste and i have a really bad back and would break my butt getting in and out of them all the time. plus, as you pointed out, they are not as fun to drive as audi, infinities, or bimmers which is a factor for me when driving! luckily, bmw and audi have not followed mbs direction of low ground clearance on their sedan and those 3 makes will most likely be the brands i cross shop next time around, maybe lexus if they can improve upon the is enough for my liking. "
sweendogy,October 2010," i agree the infiniti is not a great deal in awd form vs the infiniti. mpg on this car stinks, i have a pontiac5x. i really hope the infiniti owners get more mpgs because the 3k difference in price for me is not worth the lack of quickness. i just went on infiniti website and the new infiniti is now ltoyotaed.. no manual stinks...no navi in the cheepo 25 and the price of the sport(infiniti) now starts with all the options (i would get them all, yes) and its a tad under 40k-- right now i am not a fan.. infinti where is the manual awd car we are looking for. "
smarty666,October 2010," it is my hope that the lack of manual, nav, and a few other things on the infiniti was done intentionally by infiniti b/c they really are just using the 25 right now to test the entry-lux level for it and see how it does. all those features it lacks would jack the price up on the infiniti further making it compete in the infiniti territory of price which would be just plain ridiculous. remember, this generation g is coming to an end hopefully at the end of next year since 2011 is the fifth model year now, and it will be due for a redesign across the board for 2012.its my hope that if the infiniti sells okay for infiniti that when they go to redo the 3g g-sedan they will completely redo/rethink the infiniti and add these features and maybe even make a totally different body style for it from the high trim g sedan. this is just speculation of course though. "
smarty666,October 2010, just read this and thought some of you might want to read it since we have been discussing the infiniti a lot.http://www.insideline.com/infiniti/infiniti/2011/2011-infiniti-infiniti-sedan-first-drive.- - html 
sweendogy,October 2010," i think from that article you posted that infiniti didnt change the body for a reason.. and that reason is to take on the bmw328-- keeping pricing as its biggest advantage and not losing the ""g"" spirit. i think its a calculated move but misses the target without the manual option. as for the g coming to an end in 2012--is that the case?? why would they offer this car for just one year before an overhaul... dont know why you toyota ""hopefully"" - this is the car that saved infiniti from being boring. "
nyccarguy,October 2010," for different folks.every single one of these car has pluses and minuses to different people. for the longest time ive actually favored handling and driving toyotamics over raw power and torque.maybe im getting older & the fact that i live in ct where the entrance dodgeps on the merrit parkway are short and have stop signs at the beginning of them has something to do with it. my 2001 honda honda type sh handles brilliantly. however, its 200 horsepower @ 7000 rpm (7500 rpm redline), 156 lb/ft of torque @ 5250 rpm, & almost 128,000 miles just doesnt quite cut the mustard anymore. even my wifes 4cyl acura feels like it has more pickup. im not in the market now because i just bought a house and a second car payment is out of the question right now. plus i think were going to try and ditch the acura next year to get wifey an suv of some sort (she misses her 07 x3).so if she gets an suv, then my next ride doesnt have to be huge. just as long as it has latches for the car seat so i can take my boys somewhere without stranding wifey without a car (she can drive stick, but hasnt in years). in my new home,ill be putting over 21,000 miles per year on a car just commuting.i believe with the modern electronic nannies (traction control, stability control, abs), i can rock a rwd sport sedan through our winters with a dedicated set of snow tires (as i do with my honda).the infiniti is priced right, has gobs of power, and im really impressed with how it handles. ive only driven an awd infiniti, so i can only imagine how well the s handles.bmw are not cheap to buy. 3 series are everywhere you turn. i love the way the e90 3 series drives, rides, handles, brakes. ive only owned new car in my life since i passed my driving test at 16 (im only 34 now), but i will totally consider a cpo n55 powered bmw in the future.like i toyota before, the lexus is350 appeals to me. i like the styling, the interior is very well finished im sure, they now offer an f sport version of the is which im sure sharpens the handling. i went to lexus and built one, it isnt as expensive as i once thought. but no stick shift available on the is350 kills me. i know there is a stick offered on the is250, but that car has the pickup of a toyota. at least the slushbox awd version i drove did. the brakes are impossible to modulate. there is no way the steering is as sharp as the 3 series. i keep my car for a while. going on 9 years with my 01 honda (bought new as a leftover in april 02). well see what happens when the time comes. "
ivan_99,October 2010," heh...i think you have my email confused with somebody else.i dont think i wrote ""fact"" in any email...obviously i do not deal in facts  just conjecture, speculation, rumors...  "
ivan_99,October 2010, ahh...awd...that usually kills mpg.i cant think of an awd that gets 30+mpg; even partial awd systems that kick in at wheel spin. there must be one...somewhere; maybe an audi tdi audi...something like that.other than cost i dont see much that would sway anybody towards the infiniti 
ivan_99,October 2010, ill reply to myself a 2011 audi 2.0t audi 6sp manual.21/31 
shipo,October 2010," you beat me to it. funny thing; i live in a rather hilly part of (often) snowy new hampshire and i have yet to understand why so many folks ""need"" awd. i mean geez, unless you have a driveway like my cross the street neighbor (a driveway that rises more than 100 over a dtoyotaance of about 250), i feel that the extra weight of an awd system can actually lead to a less safe vehicle when its slippery out there. ""less safe?"" some might question. yes, less safe. why? because the extra weight will, if anything, lengthen stopping dtoyotaances and reduce the already diminished capahonda for a quick maneuver.fwiw #1, when we moved up here i had a 530i sp, and after the first quarter inch snow fall i promptly ordered a set of winter wheels and tires; they in turn transformed my bmw from a car that couldnt make it up my driveway (only a 9% grade), to a car that could easily reel in awd and 4wd vehicles in rutted snow up to about 7"" deep (beyond that my car would turn into a snow plow, causing me to simply stay home or leave it at home in favor of a set of cross-country skis).fwiw #2, the neighbor i referred to above has a winter tire shod audi audi audi, and as often as not, when the snow flies i see his car either parked down by the street, or stuck kinda sideways some dtoyotaance up above the road. toyota another way, even awd isnt all its cracked up to be on really steep slopes. "
Kirstie_H,October 2010," it isnt *just* awd on these vehicles. im certainly not an expert, but for whatever reason, i havent had good luck with mpg results on infiniti. right now, im looking at putting an average of under 10k miles per year on my car, so its not a big deal. but when i was driving 22k/year, low mpg on my pontiac5 (rwd) was disappointing. "
ivan_99,October 2010, what kind of mileage do you get? i had an 03 pontiac5 and would see about 21mpg or so. this was mostly highway (70-80%).at the time i thought it was fine...but today... with hyundai putting out more power than my g did back then (especially with the old hp rating system) and getting in the 30s mpg...my expectations have increased. 
smarty666,October 2010," no, i didnt say they were ending the g they will be due for a redesign on the g model since 2011 is the 5th model year of the 2g. i wouldnt get so hung up on the lack of manual at this point. like the article says, there is no demand for the manual and infiniti even has trouble selling them in the infiniti so most are not going to want the manual in a infiniti and they might have some cost issues with at least offering. the acura does not offer a manual and you dont see its sales tanking. yes the option is nice to have but infiniti might have the lack of it as an excuse to force people to get the more expensive infiniti as a sales ploy so you never know. maybe in the future they will make it an order only option.the 3g g models are just around the corner and im eagerly anticipating what infiniti is going to do to their best selling vehicle. im interested to see what influence mb is going to have on the next gen g engine since nissan/infiniti is now in a co-op partnership with diamler and they are suppose to be sharing things between divisions! "
smarty666,October 2010," well i cant speak for when, how, and what kind of vehicle you have, but i know from multiple bad winter storms here in nj over the years, that with my fx, i was all over the road with just the rwd. i tried driving numerous times without the awd and ii was scared for my life. even doing 10-20mph below speed limit and being extremely careful the wheels would spin out. once i engaged awd the vehicle felt planted to the road and i stopped spinning out and having difficulties controlling the vehicle. everything i read to this day still says awd is the preferable option for winter weather traveling and i concur with my own personal experience.to me, there is usally only a 1-2 mpg difference between awd and rwd so mise well not take the chance and sacrifice a little mpg. personally, i like that infiniti has awd option and not awd all the time like subaru and others. this way, 85% of the year i can use just the rwd with better fuel economy and just use awd when i need it specifically. if there is ice on the road forget awd or any drive for that matter. when there is ice on the ground nothing can help you. "
jimbres,October 2010," shipos point is that with the right tires - dedicated winter tires - one can safely drive an rwd car on snow-covered roads. did you switch to dedicated winter tires, or were you using all-season tires when you tried to drive in rwd mode in snowy conditions?if the latter, then you really werent addressing shipos point. "
Karen_S,October 2010," a retoyotar is hoping to talk with a new mercedes mercedes owner, as well as anyone who recently bought a new mercedes after having owned lexus models in the past. thanks for sending your contact information to [email?protected] no later than tuesday, october 12, 2010. "
smarty666,October 2010," i didnt realize he was referring to winter tires so that is my bad. if that is what he was making then maybe with really excellent quality winter tires you could get away with just rwd. you are right, i had all season tires on the vehicle since i dont have the extra money lying around to go buy a second set of tires just for winter driving. i cant see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year. just my personal preference. "
fedlawman,October 2010," ""the acura does not offer a manual and you dont see its sales tanking.""the acura is available with a 6-speed mt - one of the best on the market. "
fedlawman,October 2010," ""i cant see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year.""spending several thousand dollars on awd that you only use on occasion (and hurts performance the other 9-10 months) is a much better idea... :confuse: "
sweendogy,October 2010," acura does come in manual--and has since they started making the car..and has pretty sweet throws. on acura sales not tanking, i would like to see the numbers. the reason infinti offers a manual is to compete with the bmw 3 but- i guess research shows that the lower 328 sells most car as autos which for me is a shame. i need a infiniti 6 speed. and on the diamler partnership i agree i hope they keep the nissan 3.7 (or do they go to 4.0) - it might be loud and offers less mpgs but its a pure beast "
shipo,October 2010," you cant afford a set of winter tires but you can afford to buy awd? uhhh, what did i miss?fwiw, the winter tires paid for themselves, and then some. consider the following: - i had the 530i for three winters before i turned it in at lease end. - the winter wheel/tire set cost me $1,005. - at lease end my factory tires all had at least 1mm more tread depth than bmw finances minimum, and as such i didnt need to buy a new set of summer performance tires; cost (then): ~$900 installed. - after the bmw was gone i sold the winter wheel/tire set for $500.long story short, not only did i not pay a fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred dollar up charge for awd, i made $395 by spending the $1,005 on the winter wheel/tire set. kinda like found money. "
edwardsf,October 2010," hmm, what is this ""agree"" thingy? well, okay, i will run with it. regarding ground clearance, i have the same issue with getting in and out. my audi avec sport package was lower to the ground than my 3 series (sans sport package) and the audi seat were just a smidgen lower. this meant i used my back much more getting out of the audi than i do now with the bimmer. so make sure you try them all in various packages. btw, the bimmer non sport seemed to be similar in cornering to the audi sport. of course, the audi sticks better due to awd but the bimmers steering is just sublime. i truly think the audi is the balance between the bimmer and the mercedes. i also felt that the infiinty drove heavier than all three german car. the g almost reminded me of an american muscle car. nb, i only drove used (2007-8) models. but since car dont seem to get lighter, i think the germans are probably more nimble feeling than the infinity. regarding my other infirmity, i have a hearing loss and carefully scrutinized for road noise. the germans win again, especially the c300 and the 3 series. the new audi was definitely my favorite car but it really was had much more road noise than the the others. also, the lexus were pretty quiet. that toyota, i like almost all these car on the ltoyota on the right. the only exceptions are the caddy, which just seems gauche and the cdodgeped, slow is250. they all have their strengths and car are really just better now. "
sweendogy,October 2010," edwards lets play a game, guess the ""german""car and driver review of 3 car:1)highs: well sculpted inside and out, a feeling of flingability, the interior&#146;s &#147;ash almond beige&#148; wood hyundai.lows: road noise, wind noise, engine noise that lacks the manners expected at nearly $$$$$ large.the verdict: very rico, not very suave.2)highs: seriously fast, seriously groovy in the turns, serious seat well matched to the serious g capability of the chassis.lows: v-6 is a little rough, the clutch takeup is abrupt and stiff besides, tight on toe space in back. the verdict: muscular and poised, and low-profile about it; a machine for you, not your audience.3) highs: hey-lookit-me visuals, plush leather lining, comfy in back (for two), hushed at high speeds.lows: the steering&#146;s zone of indifference on-center, flinty ride over small bumps, too many buttons..the verdict: all the right stuff but can&#146;t make connissantion. guess the german? "
jimbres,October 2010,"  i cant see spending several hundred dollars for tires you only would use on occasion 2-3 months out of the year. just my personal preference. my guess is that youre a young guy. all-season radial tires didnt become widely available until the mid to late 1970s. before that, just about everyone who lived in the snow belt switched tires - from regular to snows, as they were called then - at the beginning of winter & then switched back to regular tires at the beginning of spring. keep in mind that almost everyone drove rwd car in those days. fwd didnt become widely available until the 70s, & awd was available only on trucks until the 90s.i remember that dad always made the switch to snow tires on the friday after thanksgiving.something else to remember is that your regular tires will last that much longer if youre running with winter tires during the cold weather months. so the total ownership cost is less than you think.given that tires are the only part of your car that actually touches the road, do you really want to cheap out on them? think about it. if you cant afford top quality rutoyotaer for your car, you might be better off riding the bus.

smarty666,October 2010, sure! winter tires are not exactly known for smooth ride and low noise level so why would i want to deal with that from dec-mar! ill take the smoother/more quiet ride all season tires offer 
smarty666,October 2010," research by many companies has shown that the 6spd does not sell well on many car. that is the reason nissan stopped offering it on the nissan. there was not enough demand for it and they were losing money no the manual models. you can get a manual on the infiniti just like on the tl now so you have options if you want manual they are just much more limited then if you wanted automatic. i toyota acura sales have been pretty good so i dont know why you want numbers on why its tanking :confuse: i want them to keep the vq engines as well b/c i agree they are a performance beast, it is m hope diamler and mercedes will be able to just help nissan quiet them down a bit at idle, etc so they are more refined sounding. "
smarty666,October 2010," well, despite not getting winter tires, i have always tried to get some of the best all season tires for road grip, handling, etc to compensate and most have done pretty well. its not that big of a deal for me b/c i will not drive on the road with more than a few inches of snow. its just nice to have the awd so that i dont get stuck at work or anywhere if im not home when a winter storm or blizzard starts. "
shipo,October 2010," ""sure! winter tires are not exactly known for smooth ride and low noise level so why would i want to deal with that from dec-mar! ill take the smoother/more quiet ride all season tires offer ""bzzzt! im sorry, that is incorrect! ive driven car with a dozen different winter tires over the last few years, and to a one, the tires were easily as quiet as the rutoyotaer used on the car for the other three seasons; that and in most cases they rode smoother! ""smoother?"" you ask. yes, smoother. why? because typically when one buys a winter wheel/tire set, they ""minus one"" on the size (my 530i is a good example; the summer tires were 235/45 subaru7s while the winter tires were 225/55 subaru6s), and the taller sidewall of the winter tires afforded a cushier ride. "
nyccarguy,October 2010," bingo! right on the money as usual shipo. my winter wheels & tires are minus one on my honda (summer size 205/50 subaru6, winter size 195/60 subaru5). in 8 & a half years, ive never been stuck in my honda once. that includes getting buried overnight while parked on the street in a snowstorm by the nyc department of sanitation, living in westchester county (nyc suburb) that is anything but flat. not once being able to not make it to work (not an option, my dad is the boss & my names on the door) due to inclement weather. people look at me like i have 4 heads and 5 feet when i tell them i switch to snow tires in the winter. "
shipo,October 2010," ""people look at me like i have 4 heads and 5 feet when i tell them i switch to snow tires in the winter.""up here in new hamster the only folks i give that look to are the ones that are still driving their winter tires in july. :p "
smarty666,October 2010," i dont know why you guys are making a big deal about this winter tire bs! did you ever think maybe some people have special situations that would preclude them from doing so? not only do i not want to spend the money on a second set a tires i only use a few months out of the year, ive had 3 back surgeries and major back problem and would break my a#$ trying to lug tires in and out of car to go have them put on the car twice a year and lug them down stairs for storage the rest of the year. i spent enough money on tires and back surgeries that i dont need to go and screw up my back just to get winter tires put on my car.its much easier just to get awd and it works fine for me and a lot of other people so live with it. plus, i cant speak for other northern area of the country but i know that all the infiniti dealers and bmw dealers around where i live only have awd versions on their lots. the only way you can get rwd only is by special ordering one. once in a while you might get lucky and see a rwd only on the lot but usually the service departments snatch them up as service loaners. "
jimbres,October 2010," steady there, big guy. were just trying to educate you. no need to get excited. "
shipo,October 2010," ""the only way you can get rwd only is by special ordering one.""so? since i prefer to do european delivery (and save thousands of dollars in the process), i have to order anyway. thinking about this further, since, ummm, 1979 weve ordered 8 of our 13 car (including both of our rwd bmw, one ed, one not). "
mz6greyghost,October 2010," being from upstate ny, i can mostly agree with the amount of awd models on the local lots, but there are still rwd models available, without having to special-order them (and theyre not only base models with no options either).as far as winter tires are concerned, granted each area has a different climate, but when you live in an area that averages over 150"" of snow per year, and when it can fall at rates of 4-6"" per hour, winter tires are a must. i lose count of how many different awd vehicles (suvs, car, etc.) that end up being buried in a roadside ditch simply because their all-seasons cant keep up with the conditions. people tend to forget that awd only helps with acceleration, but does nothing in terms of steering or stopping on slippery roads. given a choice, id take a vehicle with winter tires over any awd vehicle with all-season tires, no matter which set of wheels are actually attached to the drivetrain.and iirc, there are some local dealers that actually store the winter tires/wheels for you when theyre not needed, and will swap out the 3-season wheels/tires and store them in the winter months (for a fee, of course!)

smarty666,October 2010, well then im telling you something you already know  
smarty666,October 2010," very good points and like you toyota, if there is enough snow, sleet, or god forbid ice on the ground, no awd or winter tires will save you! luckily, down here in nj, while we get our fair share of snowfall, its nothing in comparison to what you guys in upstate ny get! "
shipo,October 2010," a point you might be missing is (for lack of a better phrase), not all snow, sleet and even ice is created equal. there are plenty of winter conditions where dedicated winter tires will find a fair amount of traction where even the best all-season tires will find virtually none. "

smarty666,October 2010," yeah, i made the mtoyotaake in saying it lacked a manual but i toyota its sales have not tanked! you toyota a few posts back that i toyota the acura sales have tanked! wrong as usual. i made a mtoyotaake about the manual but not the one on sales which is the one you called me out on! wrong as usual sweenytodd! "
fedlawman,October 2010," ""you toyota a few posts back that i toyota the acura sales have tanked! wrong as usual.""actually, what he toyota was:""on acura sales not tanking, i would like to see the numbers.""i think this was a reasonable request - especially in the context of your original statement containing false information (no manual).why dont you simply provide a link to your source that shows how strong acura sales are and put this matter to rest?btw - i think this discussion is a good one, but the personal jabs between the two of you are a problem. we are talking about car here - theres no need to get inflamed. "
sweendogy,October 2010," i agree lawman.. but smarty is again mtoyotaaken as you posted, just like he was mtoyotaaken about me even talking about the acura -- i have never made comments saying the acura sales have tanked but i did say and prove (using honda own sales numbers) that tl sales have ""tanked"" since they changed to the modern design -- i can pull up the numbers again for the tl --the car i mentioned. smarty might be having flashbacks on the tl2009+ chat when i threw a bunch of slaes facts about the tl. but for smarty to say the acura sales not tanking-well again i would like to see the numbers -- wait i went to wiki and here are the facts-total american sales2003[28] 18,9322004 30,3652005[29] 34,8562006 38,0352007[30] 33,0372008[30] 31,9982009 28,6502009 was when they changed the body style-- i dont think this is a tank job-ala tl -- so smarty i agree..but acura in general cant be happy with the present momentum of sales. that was easy (sorry for the long post) "
smarty666,October 2010," again, you put words in their that i did not say. i did not say that acura sales were strong or really really good. all i toyota was that acura sales have not tanked and they havent! here is some even better figures then sweens about the acura: directly from acura media released on oct 1st based on sept and 2010 sales. sept 2010  2,256 sept 2009 2,103 percent change +7.3% ytd sept 2010  22,843 ytd sept 2009 21,300 percent change +7.7% "
smarty666,October 2010," seriously, what is wrong with you? for the last time, i did not say acura sales tanked, i toyota acura sales had not tanked! :mad: just because they have decreased over the last two years by a few thousand does not mean they are tanking and as i just showed you in a post above, the acura is higher in sales this year thus far then at this time last year hence a upward rise. yeah, your figures really showed how bad the acura sales have tanked and here is the figures for the tl to show its decrease in sales and thus poor sales performance, taken from acura media newsroom.ytd 2010 25,031ytd 2009 25,882ytd - 1.8% tl 2004 sales: 77,895tl 2005 sales: 78,218tl 2006 sales: 72,348tl 2007 sales: 58,545tl 2008 sales: 48,766tl 2009 sales: 33,620 as you can see, the sales decrease in the tl is quite substantial compared to the acura and hence why i have toyota tanked for the tl. it is sad considering the tl was acura bread and butter model for so many years and that now has changed to the acura. you can state a whole host of reasons why it dropped but its safe to say that the acura has been a better success for them then the tl is right now. "
sweendogy,October 2010," run forest run, - again -i did not disagree with you, just wanted the numbers... re-read what i toyota i was agreeing with you, take a deep breath- but thanks for reposting the tl numbs, good stuff, this was something i posted in the 2009 tl chat months ago..as a weird twtoyota you replied to that one too..  decaf bro. "
murphydog,October 2010, seems i saw a story on a new 3.5 from mercedes that would bump hp to ~ 300 or so. this was a month or so ago - but no reference to what models would get it first. are there any hints when it may arrive in the c class? 
tlong,October 2010," isnt the entire auto market up over 20% 09 vs. 10? if so, a 7.7% rise means the acura is not holding its own.fwiw, imho the new acura is another example of how honda is going all wrong lately -- bigger, softer, and more tarted up with gadgets. but not better. "
duke39,October 2010," smarty,do you work for acura in california or a local dealership? "
smarty666,October 2010," yeah, i worked for both  :p that is why i posted numbers showing the tls huge sales decline over the last few years :surprise: "
Kirstie_H,October 2010," this is getting too personal. as fedlawman mentioned, were talking about car here... theres no need to get all bent out of shape if someone disagrees with your perspective. "
sweendogy,October 2010, didnt see that murpdog but it seems they prob need to do something- i dont know how well the c class is selling. dont see many in newengland- the c63/c65 is a monster and they prob need a better bridge to that car from the c350. 
edwardsf,October 2010," ah. i thought the game was all germans. yeah, i didnt think they fit that well. for instance, lush leather aint in a c series. "
sweendogy,October 2010," well it was a good try. stay tuned for the next episode of ""guess the german"" coming soon to edmunds.com "
sweendogy,October 2010, for me this is interesting that lexy would now offer after what 5 years of service make the top level is in awd.. if this car was around when i went to the g it would of been a close call -now no one really cares about this car and its a shame 
dap2006,October 2010," ok, my 2008 acura tl-s lease is ending march 2011 and im trying to decide on my next car. there are many things i like about the 2011 tl but the new beak and added size are really negatives i dont think i can get past. i just drove a 2011 infiniti (auto - wife ruled out the manual....  ) but it seems a bit small - ill have to drive it again. i enjoyed the power and handling. any thoughts out there? any other car to consider? im not a fan of the american offerings and while i love the drive of the bmw i dont like the price tag with all the options id want... :confuse: ive been on this board for several years now so i know someone might offer some thought i hadnt considered... "
plekto,October 2010," does it have to be new? i have several that id recommend if you are willing to consider something a couple of years old, like a 2008 cts. 20k, give or take, and just about perfect for your needs.i guarantee that its not ""american"" in how its designed or drives. probably the only thing that gm has for sale now, in fact, that is like that. my second recommendation is actually also from gm, but youd have to get a 2009 model, because gm stopped importing it to the u.s. then. go test drive a pontiac pontiac/holden commodore. its a fantastic vehicle and is no problem to find one for less than 20k, certified. if you want something that handles well, is rwd, has a nice interior, and is a total sleeper/under everyones radar, while being one size larger than a infiniti - without the silly price tag, look no further.i personally like it more than the current cts. im still incredibly shocked that gm took its #1 selling passenger car in australia(and best imo, that they currently make worldwide) and stopped importing it to the u.s. such an incredibly idiotic move. but you can get one used. change the badges if you wish.  note - its also sold outside the u.s. as the new chevrolet chevrolet. so at least theres some hope of it returning next year or so.these two are the only options from gm that will satisfy you if you like how the tl and infiniti and so on drive. everything else, yes, its a toad and should be avoided. but do check these out - you might be able to get a used/certified car and own it for only a little more than the payments on a lease of something like a 3 series. "
tlong,October 2010, acura?audi? (new or slightly used)bmw (slightly used)? 
nyccarguy,October 2010," if you like your 08 tl-s & think the new tl is too big (and beaky), try and get your hands on a acura v6. they dont sell well and can be had for a boatload off sticker with incentives. keep us informed of what you go with. "
dap2006,October 2010," i really havent considered the acura because it seems like a step in the wrong direction - id like a car with more, not less than i have now.ive considered the audi or s4 but ive read a lot of bad things about audi reliability.as for bmw, i think id have to move up the bmw to get the size and features i want, but i dont like the idea of making the payment each month :sick: the is350 was a thought but it has no back seat to speak of, among other faults...and on top of all that, i dont want to buy a used car - im looking at a lease because i want to swap this car out every 3 years and not mess with sales....hmmmmm............... "
kfdmed,October 2010, yes i know ... not the luxury nameplate ... cvt ... but all the luxury amenities ... and killer lease deals. 
jtla,October 2010," based on your two posts, it pretty much leaves you with infiniti  "
jtla,October 2010," i was gonna to suggest the same, but the price of a loaded nissan is approaching that of infiniti, not to mention its fwd set up and cvt. "
ivan_99,October 2010," im assuming your requirements are similar to your 08 tl i.e. youre ok with fwd...dont need super sport suspension tunning.you want space...more than an is...something around a 5 series (if the price was right).you could almost ltoyota all manufacturers and theyd each have an offering in this segment.you mentioned that youre apprehensive about audi reliability. since you lease are you concerned about being stranded and/or inconvenienced with repairs? id take a look at the domestics as well (i actually liked the cts...coupe looks very nice too)...go drive a cts, buick, sho...even go drive an lincoln and see...of course if you know youre not going to buy one then i suppose youre just watoyotaing your time (i was surprised).if youre not keen on domestics how about the european? c350 is very nice, volvo looks nice (never drove)...might be small if a 5 series is your size requirement.at this point, for me, id lean more towards a new audi 2.0t...does everything well, looks real elegant and has good mileage.i liked the new tl as well (i also like the looks  ) ...it wasnt too large and the sh-awd let me over-steer the back end out a bit...so that was pleasant. plus youd get your space requirements (guess nissan has similar specs too).new infiniti bmw?you may also lean towards the vehicles with the included maintenance as well... "
igozoomzoom,October 2010," its painful for me to admit, but the beak on the current tl is the most hideous thing ive ever seen! this is coming from someone who still can remember my first time driving my cousins brand new 1986 acura acura (dark blue with gray lower hyundai) and realizing that it was the most special car id ever driven. i later owned a 1994 acura acura gs that was the love of my life until it was demolished by a drunk jerk driving a huge 4x4- but it saved my life. i also owned a 2002 tl type-s that was a spectacular car in every way...until the transmission went out at 32k miles and then again after another 20k miles...i didnt want to own it if/when the third transmission failed if it was out of warranty, so i had to get rid of it. suffice it to say, ive been an acura-phile from the very beginning in late 1985...but the newest designs range from bland to downright vulgar (tl)....the acura seems to suffer the least from this design theme?have you considered the acura v6 as a possible replacement for your 08 tl-s? it is less than an one-inch +/- in front and rear head, leg and hip room compared to your tl. overall passenger volume is 94 cu ft vs. 98 cu ft for your tl, so its only very slightly smaller. interior cargo (luggage) volume is virtually identical at 12.6 vs. 12.5 cu ft. the infiniti infiniti is almost identical in every interior measurement (head/leg/hip room) to your tl, with 99 cu ft of passenger volume and 13.5 cu ft cargo volume. so its not smaller in any way than the tl, but the interior design or other design aspects may may it seem to be...id give it another look before ruling it out! if you are leasing, would the larger infiniti bmw also be within the realm of possibilities? it has a boost in headroom and legroom in front and rear compared to the tl. total passener volume is 104 cubic feet and cargo volume is 14.9 cu ft. not sure if i like it any better than the infiniti, but it might be something to consider....and one other wild card that i will recommend, if a luxury brand isnt esssential and youre just wanting a car that looks and performs in the same realm with most entry-level performance/luxury models- the 2011 mazdaudi s grand touring 4-door. the current 2010 is a very impressive vehicle, with exceptional handling and plenty of power any time you need it! the 3.7l v6 only has a 272hp rating, but it has 269lb-ft of torque (matching the torque figures for the 330hp bmw and exceeding all the other car discussed above, despite their 280-328hp ratings). it also hits that torque peak at 4250rpm, compared to 5200rpm in both infiniti.the only two options on the 2010 mz6 s grand touring are voice-activated navigation and the technology package. the tech package adds advanced keyeless entry & start with push-button starting, sirius sat radio, led tail lights, fully automatic bi-xenon hid headlamps, power passenger seat and rain-sensing wipers. with those two options, it is a very close match for the infiniti, feature-for-feature but for $6-7k less! the 2011 model is getting a refresh that willl only make the car more attractive and upscale in look and feel. its worth a visit to the mazda dealer one day, just to experience the car for yourself. my best friend and i took one for a test drive two weekends ago and he wasnt even in the market for a new car....but he traded his 2008 is 250 on the spot for it!  "
smarty666,October 2010," i can definitely feel you about the new tl. i have a 08 as well and the new one is such a turn off on the exterior for me its not even funny. if you think the infiniti is small then i would not recommend a 3 series or mercedes since they are even smaller on the inside. i would recommend a caddy cts or like others have mentioned the new nissan. if your looking for the true sport sedan feel you wont get that completely with the max due to the cvt/fwd but it definitely has got a more sport oriented handling and power. i ended up with one b/c like you did not want a infiniti due to the cdodgeped feeling when in it. the max has plenty of room, pretty sporty body style, and you get certain features you normally can only get in luxury sedan if you get the premium packages. the leasing and financing for it are excellent and many people are getting fully loaded ones for $34-35k. if that doesnt fit your bill, i would check out the hyundai but again, some people dont like the hyundai name plate. not sure what budget or finances are for your but if possible, i would check out the new m and 5 series as well. they are definitely going to fit your bill when it comes to size and features but you will pay more for them obviously. best of luck!!! "
dap2006,October 2010," great post! gave me some things to think about. i havent been an acura fan as long as you but i had a 92 honda that i loved and kept 12 years - i got a 2006 tl after that and then my current tl-s. i had driven the bmw before i got the tl-s and loved the drive - almost pulled the trigger but my wife had loved the honda/acura (2 previous honda) so i caved and i went with my current ride (which is nice, dont get me wrong).im not a mazda fan but ill take a look at the mz6 to see what it looks like. i cant see me driving a mercedes, though - too much coin for what you get. so far im thinking the audi audi/s4, infiniti and bmw seem the likely suspects... :shades: :shades: "
ivan_99,October 2010, i loved the mazdaudi v6 as well...in the manual-auto mode i had it in 1st gear at around 4k rpm -- just going down the street. i hammered it and chirped the tires into 2nd gear.not really a marketable feature...or even worthy of purchasing it for (since it is very good overall). but a very powerful v6. rear seat room is huge too.loved the manual in the mazda 6...too bad it only was on the 4cylnot much love for the mazda 6...dont see many.same as the volkswagen cc -- dont see many. i actually prefer the cc over many in this thread. 
plekto,October 2010," i will mention, though, that the new cts is worlds better than anything mazda makes. its positioned in europe as a bmw 5 series competitor at a lot less money. my parents just went through this exact same scenario. and had it down to the same models are you are looking at. and the cts just simply was a superior product to the infiniti. the only vehicle that gave it serious competition was the c300, which is my #1 pick if money is no object. it;s everything that you want and mercedes is apparently finally making their car right again. though currently only the c class is benefiting, as will the upcoming model e class(it takes time to re-tool and phase in new technology)also, i mentioned the pontiac because while 2009 was the last year for it, it had the same suspension and engine as a cts. its a worlds better choice than the buick and actually is fairly attractive by comparison(looks like a cross between the cts and the buick, imo - slightly rounded but not a jellybean.but lets look at the math on slightly used vs lease:first off, infiniti has no financing options currently on 2011 models. (its impossible to find a 2010 to lease at this point). fail.lets look at acura, then. oops. same deal.k... mercedes. mercedes always runs leases(as does volkswagen and audi) c300 $349/month for 27 months. 10k/yr. $3141at signing.total at lease end: 12215 in payments. $452.41/month.(a bmw bmw is $439/month with 0 down at signing for reference)lets have some fun, then. 2011 honda ex. $229 /month for 36 months. $1499 at signing. total at lease end: 9743 in payments. $270.64/month.now why would i do this comparison? because to lease any vehicle, you have to factor in what it costs versus a used model that still has the same amount of factory warranty left. 36 months lease vs 36 months(or more) warranty. now, the main deal here is the drive train, which is pretty much all that matters(most certified car get an extension anyways and the gremlins have been worked out/fixed. its basically a wash, imo, since a 2 year old car wont break anyways unless its something nasty like a suzuki or daewoo. i did a 2 minute search for a 2009 pontiac with low mileage and under $25k.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=c&car_id=279792030figure $22k now and $12k in three years. thats $10k for three years. i put the honda in as a comparison because what this means is that you can get a certified year old vehicle and run it for three years for the same price as an economy car lease.but theres no wear and tear adjustment, no money factor idiocy or other tricks, no mileage cap or penalty. in short, you can own and decide to keep to trade whenever you want for the same price as a lease. the only difference is the payment structure per month. but a 72 month payment plan will usually net (now due to silly low interest rates) about the same monthly payment as a lease. if you want out of it, or to buy it at the end of the ""payments"", its a clear win. keep paying the bank or just sell it and end up with 0 month owed after 36 months.i get about $350 a month in this scenario vs $450 a month for the mercedes or bmw. note - you can get a 2008 cts for about ~25k and the money works out the same as the cts depreciates a bit less - ~15k at 6 years old. the only difference is $400 a month and the same $10k total cost.let some other person eat the 10-15k initial depreciation. never buy new. "
alltorque,October 2010," i will mention, though, that the new cts is worlds better than anything mazda makes. its positioned in europe as a bmw 5 series competitor at a lot less money. here in uk, the bmw 5s run from ?31k for the 523i se to around ?50k for the 550i se, with lots of diesels. the cadillac cts runs from ?27k for the 2.8 v6 thro ?30k for the 3.6 v6 to ?56k for the 6.2 v8, (though who would buy that beats me). cts is generally compared unfavourably to bmw/merc/jag/audi due to poor ride/handling, (our roads arent great), and having no diesel options..............a very big points loser !not sure ive ever seen one on the road.the mazda 6 runs from ?16k for the 1.8 s through to ?23k for the 2.2d sport estate, (wagon). gets rated highly, for price, if a tad noisy and there are lots of diesels. "
dap2006,October 2010," i drove the audi audi premium plus w/ sport package today - i was looking for a audi but they had just arrived and werent prepped yet. great interior, solid, high quality all around - liked the nav, seat, leds etc.. much to like here. only problem - turbo lag. the salesman assured me the car would learn how i drive and adjust within 500 miles, also that the audi had half the lag - ill go back and see. other than that, very pleasing...anyone else have any experience with the audi turbo? does the lag improve? "
tlong,October 2010," personally i dont see how 4wd or ""learning how you drive"" would get rid of turbo lag. might be a bs salesman wanting a sale or lease. but what do i know? "
plekto,October 2010," well, yeah, the u.k. is its own bit of insanity when it comes to vehicles. bigger autobahn and highway chrysler arent really appreciated over there. doubly so if there isnt a diesel option. and, the new cts doesnt have a tiny engine option, either - you get big and guzzling or you go home but here in the u.s., yes, its cheaper than a 5 series by a fair amount especially at the end of the model year, is a bit more reliable, and drives essentially the same. of course its now a 3 series competitor, but few things are. "
v8nuts,October 2010, well i decided to get the bmw last year and am glad i did it is worth every penny . i drove my friends infiniti and was very disappointed in the way the engine makes it power compared the the twin turbo 335. there is nothing like the torque of twin turbos on the street with all of it available at 2k or so... 
alltorque,November 2010," well, yeah, the u.k. is its own bit of insanity when it comes to vehicles. bigger autobahn and highway chrysler arent really appreciated over there. doubly so if there isnt a diesel option. absolutely correct...............but you do us a dis-service. we have lots of bits of insanity when it comes to car. why else would people buy peugeots or g-whizz electric death traps ?still, with gas at circa $7 per us gallon equivalent smaller and/or diesel engines are not so much insanity but rather financial imperatives. ulsd is, of course, up to 20 cents more expensive, (but its the only diesel fuel you can buy for road use). "
rayainsw,November 2010," ""also, i mentioned the pontiac because while 2009 was the last year for it, it had the same suspension and engine as a cts.""the cts was not & is not available with a normally aspirated v8.the pontiac gt [ i have one ] has a n/a 6.0l v8.i considered the cts before my purchase - and the availability of a 6.0l v8 would likely have pushed my to select the cts.the v6 in the cts [either version] does not provide the tq i really want...- raytq addict "

plekto,November 2010," well, i was talking about the normal version. the v8 pontiac is its own brand of special goodness that makes a cts-v kind of a non-issue for most people who dont plan to use their car on track days. still sad that they took such a nice looking vehicle out of their lineup. what we have left for us normal working class people are cartoon car like the chevrolet and dodge when this actually also worked as a perfectly find daily driver/family sedan. still, even a base model pontiac is a great car if you cant afford a cts.

Kirstie_H,November 2010," the whole thing constitutes a ridiculous and unsupportable argument - every vehicle has left some owner stranded somewhere. theyre machines. they break down. mass manufacturing leads to inevitable defects in some units.my pontiac5 has been perfect for over 100k miles, but that doesnt mean i discount the issues that others have had with the same year/make/model.

sweendogy,November 2010, yeah your point well taken. nice work fbi 
edwardsf,November 2010," re: the acceleration, i think it is called salesman ignorance, not bsregarding the turbolag in the audi, i think it is not the awd but is the lousy cvt audi puts in the fwd audi. the cvt improves gas mileage but acceleration suffers. (i liked the cvt in the nissan.) i test drove several 2010 audi with and without the cvt and there is a huge difference between the cvt and the tiptronic in the audi - the tip it is much smoother and seems faster. i had a 2007 audi audi, which had a little more turbo lag - the 2010 is much smoother and almost eliminates turbo lag. that toyota, turbo lag aint all bad because it means you get turbo acceleration. as fun and fast as my bmwt is, it does not give the whoosh that the torque in the audi gives in 40-60 mph. i am an odd creature in that i love audi (and swedish saabs) but dont own one. i own a bimmer because it is quieter and i have a hearing problem. both are vunderval! car. the audi is prettier, with more luxurious leather and a smoother, more refined driving feel. the 328 handles better, is faster throughout the mph range and is more reliable. the 335, of course, is faster but much more expensive and has a lousy repair record. regarding size, the bmw (sedan) is a bit cdodgeped but the it (sportwagon) has about the same amount of interior space as the audi sedan and wagon. or, how about a used 528 or 535? if you get a 2009, you get 4 years of warranty - 2 years of original warranty and two years of cpo. you eliminate those first two years of huge depreciation if you bargain well. car.com has a 2009 in l.a. with 13k for $36,000. you could get it for $31,000. other thoughts - try the new volvo volvo. it looks very cool and is very fast. new jags are gorgeous. dap, you are right: the infiniti is cdodgeped. the c300 is cdodgeped. the is250 is like a 70s band - supercdodgeped. the tl does have a nasty beak and is sorta ponderous. the acura is downscale from these car but still a cool rig. the cts - despite what pletko thinks - is an american car. "
plekto,November 2010," yes, but its unlike anything gm has produced to date. it punks almost everything from japan and most of the stuff out of europe and was designed with european tastes and drivers in mind.but yeah, it is made by a u.s. based company. "
dap2006,November 2010," i test drove several 2010 audi with and without the cvt and there is a huge difference between the cvt and the tiptronic in the audi - the tip it is much smoother and seems faster.ahh, that explains it - ill be going back to try the audi soon. i really liked the audi interior - truly a pleasure. my wife seems to think we need a bigger back seat but that is a minor consideration for me - it would get little use.ill really have to give the cpo 535 some thought - i really hadnt considered buying a used car but i can see it has its advantages.the cts isnt a player for me, though im sure its a nice car. "
sanjaysdca,November 2010, if you are looking at slightly used check out infiniti m. nice car with big depriciation. autotrader has one 2009 bmwawd with 15k miles for $39k2008 bmwwith 31k miles for $32kboth in orange county (zip 62626) 
plekto,November 2010," kind of odd, though, that you wont consider a pre-owned cts while you will consider a pre-owned 535. they are fairly similar. but the cts is a lot less expensive as a cpo vehicle and quite a bit more reliable as well.another car to try out - and this is a bit of an oddball, but bear with me - is the mazda. it fits 4 adults just fine, and the oddly shaped rear doors aside, its basically a 4 door sport sedan. fantastic ride, though - just a tiny bit slower than a boxster and handles as well, too. the last would be either a saab or volvo. other than that, well, youre stuck with crossovers and suvs. it honestly sounds like your wife wants a toyota or similar and you want a 3 series and youre stuck in a no-mans land of trying to find the perfect compromise. except that compromises by nature arent perfect and never will be. p.s. if you want audi at less money, just get the volkswagen version. but expect to pay a lot in repairs and upkeep for both. ive never known anyone who has had either brand who hasnt had it chew at their pocketbook to keep running. "
edwardsf,November 2010," poster: i dont like apples. pletko: ah, you need to try a granny smith. poster: i dont want cocoa puffs.pletko: have you considered new and improved cocoa puffs? poster: i am not considering opiates.pletko: you really should consider heroin. it is made for non opiate likers. dude, give it a rest. cant you respect ther peoples taste and requests? kirstie assures me there are no car salesmen here. but you seem like one. do you really want to give that impression? also, dap says he thinks some of those car are too cdodgeped and you mention the mazda. buwahahahaha. that is a good one pletko. keep em coming. another clever joke by you: the volkswagen cc is the volkswagen version of the audi audi. no. its not. not anymore than a chevrolet chevrolet is a cts. different platform. different engine configuration and tuning. different suspension. different awd system. different transmission. different interior. they do have one thin in common: both get average reliability from cr. and i dont really believe you have any friends that dont own gms. ""hey lou, seen the new chevrolet?"" ""hey lou, thought about a pontiac?"" ""hey, lou, you should consider a cts."" ""hey, lou, wait up. hey lou! lou?"" "
mvs1,November 2010," that is the absolute funniest post ive read on these boards...im having some series issues selecting my next vehicle. ill need a new ride when i turn my pontiac5xs in end of dec. im toying with the 335xi, manual tranny, nav, m sport package, etc. and an audi s4. i couldnt do another g sedan even with the upgrades from 08 to 11 the car is...well...nice.the used 09 5 series is an interesting option...hmmm. "
plekto,November 2010," i was a little sarcastic, but i guess it got lost in translation. hes pretty much unhappy with everything, and really hes got maybe mazda, mitsubishi, and volvo left. he wants something sporty and that handles well, and were out of options, really. (i personally think his wife needs to get over the whole cargo/back seat thing unless they have 3 kids) it sounds like she wants a crossover/wagon.oh, wait - i forgot one - the lexus g. thats about all thats left. as for the volkswagen/audi comparison, it depends which models. he obviously thinks that the audi is too small, so the next size larger, well there is a volkswagen that uses the audi platform but is between the audi and audi in size (ie - the volkswagen) while they arent literal clones, they share so much dna and parts they might as well be fighting over who gets the china in the estate sale. id certainly not pay audi prices without looking at the volkswagen first. "
dap2006,November 2010," actually, im not unhappy with everything but simply weighing the pros and cons - that was the point of soliciting others opinions. your sarcasm seems to flow from frustration with my not considering your gm options, but as i originally posted, im not a fan of the american offerings - nothing personal there.likewise, i dont consider volkswagen, mazda, or mitsubishi as acceptable alternatives. and while my wife prefers a larger back seat than an audi, i dont think that confines us to rav 4s or suv-type options.to get back to the discussion, at this point my best bets seem to be a infiniti, bmw, bmw 5 series (new or more likely cpo) - still thinking (and thanks to all!) "
Kirstie_H,November 2010," ill throw in my $0.02 here, realizing that thats all it is...youre likely to get much more bang for your buck by going used on any of the 3 vehicles at the top of your ltoyota. id look for off-lease / cpo vehicles. in my experience, leased vehicles are often more well-looked after if for no other reason than the person leasing fears extra charges at lease turn-in. i bought a pontiac5 several years ago off-lease and it had taken a pretty significant depreciation hit.... ive beat the tar out of it mileage-wise and mechanically its still perfect. ymmv. "
dap2006,November 2010," im going to look into the cpo options, though i like the idea of leasing - new car, no trade-in hassle, and frequency of change being attractive. "
Kirstie_H,November 2010," you seem to have a pretty good idea of your wants & needs, and thats great. im sure youll end up with whats right for you. the only aspect of leasing vs. buying cpo for *me* is that i can get a used g-series with a shorter (than 5 year) term loan and the payment on that is about the same as a lease payment (assuming there are up-front costs associated with the lease), and after 3 yrs or so, i own the vehicle and can use the trade-in value on a new vehicle. something to thing about and research, but in the end you should just do what you can afford and what makes you happiest! "
plekto,November 2010," i could have sworn that i also pointed that out before as well. :p why lease when you can own it for the same money a year or two older? everyone that i know who has done this instead has had a lot less stress and worries as well, because theres no issues with mileage, wear, or other idiocy that they make you go through with a typical lease. and the interest rates are often quite a bit better on a car loan versus a lease when you crunch the numbers.the car you are looking at are fine, really - i happen to like the cts. but thats literally the only gm or ford car that i can stand - im certainly no fan and would buy a mercedes or similar in a heartbeat over anything else they make. ive owned a (used) s class in the past and the domestics have a long way to reach that level. for the first three months id constantly be hondad just getitng into it and playing with the options. - there was a literal chasm between my previous buick and the mercedes. it died - sad story there. then i got a 4x4 two other car to look at would be the e class and the lexus gs350. these depreciate quickly and are two excellent ""hidden gems"" in the cpo world. a 2007 gs 350 should run you about 25k and a 2009 e class (built on the new more reliable c class platform, but stretched) should be about 30k.kially, 4 years old is the sweet spot between age and pricing, but the e class came out in 2009. the 2008 and earlier models were a disaster to keep running by comparison.iirc, mercedes also has new car financing (1.9%) and leases on cpo models from time to time.(yes, lease a cpo used car - c class payments on a e class) lexus might have changed to this as well in reaction - youd have to check for specifics.edit - they do have 1.9% for 48 months on cpo c class models right now - its going to be hard to beat that price-wise. the new/better body style started in 2008. imo, the rear seat in the new c class are roomier than in the infiniti. the panododgeic sunroof is incredible as well. "
Kirstie_H,November 2010," well, you do get the full warranty in force for (usually) the duration of ownership if you lease. i can understand why that would be attractive. and, if you consider trading in to be a hassle that is just not worth the effort, theres another reason.i wouldnt lease, but i can understand why some people do. "
igozoomzoom,November 2010," ""im going to look into the cpo options, though i like the idea of leasing - new car, no trade-in hassle, and frequency of change being attractive.""bmw financial services and infiniti financial services both offer leases on cpo vehicles, just like new ones. bmw limits the lease term to no more than 48 months on vehicles that arent current model year, but thats the only major difference that i am aware of. the lease payments should also be quite a bit lower than new without the hit of first year depreciation!bmw cpo warranty extends the new car full vehicle 4-year/50k warranty to 6-years/100k miles. infiniti also extends the warranty to 6yrs/100k. if you decide to check out infiniti cpo offerings, i still find the previous-generation (2006-2010) bmw5/m45 very appealing....especially the bmwport model!  "
edwardsf,November 2010," i just finished a lease and much prefer my current option of owning a cpo. kirstie is right; there is some pressure in having a leased car as you are afraid every ding or tear will be costly. also, i never felt it was my car (because it wasnt, someone will say ; - ). but leasing a cpo is an interesting idea - no depreciation and you get frequency of change btw, i think the bmw cpo is not quite as good as you have it described. when the new car warranty ends the cpo begins. it is consecutive, not cumulative. so, if you have 50k and 2years when you buy a cpo car, the new car warranty ended at 50k. so you only get 2 years or 40k miles of cpo - whatever is less.  i think you pay $50 when you take it in for cpo repairs. also, the cpo also excludes a few items that are covered in the new car. still, for $22,000 off the mrsp of a car with no model changes, i will take it. "
r34,November 2010," there is no deductible for the cpo progdodge of saab (the dealers were more generous to define an issue as warranty work too) but there is a $50 deductible (per service visit) for audi, bmw, and infiniti.several of my friends got pontiac5 and fx34/45 with no extended warranty or cpo, they seem to be doing fine.cpo is a way to go for european car. the repair could be expensive. i had 3 saabs. they had good engines but got minor issues. the 9-5 aero was the best and i still missed it. i wanted to try something different.i tried the pontiac5x but was not impressed. i was looking at infiniti ex/fx and bmw 530xi but ended up with a 335xi (love the twin turbo and i didnt need backseat). i traded one saab for a v6 audi and another saab for a 335xi (i need awd for my daily commute to milwaukee from chicago).except the 1st saab, i bought them all as used (cpo). no big issues with them. the audi seems to be better. volkswagen is still unreliable but audi seems to be ok now (mine has zero problem). i test drove the volkswagen. audi and volkswagen are different! i like the interior and the image of of audi (good for road trip) but i like the power and handling of the bimmer. if the new s4 is really as good as the bmw, i will definitely get the s4.if backseat is a must, i would pick bmw. "
kyfdx,November 2010," ..while technically possible, isnt practical in most cases... usually, the brand-new model will lease out at a lower price.. new bmw leases include free maintenance... you can really lock in your costs... tires, gas, insurance... thats it for three years.. if you think that isnt valuable, call your local infiniti or lexus dealer and tell the you are bringing in your g or is for the 30k service and ask for a quote... :surprise: "
smarty666,November 2010," yeah, but add up the extra amount per month on the lease and what you had to put down on that bmw, similarly equipped of course, to that g or is and see if it adds up to a lot more, at the end of the 3 or 4 year lease, to what is going to be quoted by the infiniti or lexus dealer for the 30k service your indirectly paying for that ""free"" maintenance by the bimmers higher price premium and lease. "
nyccarguy,November 2010," cpo car are a great way to ""save"" money in this ultra competitive entry level luxury performance sedan segment. you still have to do some digging & not just take the dealers word for it as all cpos are not created equal. some dealers look at the car with a more finely tuned microscope than others. check into the service records. is it a local car serviced by the selling dealership or was it bought at a company auction? one poster on the x3 board (from az i think) test drove a cpo x3 that he felt wasn up to snuff. something about the back window regualtors being faulty, he ended up buying the x3 in ca i think. you still are buying a used car.from a ""deal"" standpoint, leasing a cpo car doesnt make sense. for the simple reason that no 2 cpo car are alike. the dealer can set their own lease rates & money factors. it isnt like leasing new where there is a november progdodge and the lease rate on every 2011 bmw w/ x drive sedan is 0.xxxx or residual is xx%. there are just way too many vhondables that the dealer controls that you as a consumer dont have access to. even the asking prices are arbitrary. you could negotiate a fantastic deal of $5k off, and then they jack up the lease rate and say the bank set a low residual.free scheduled maintenance is a crucial sticking point that makes bmw stand out. yes were are all smart enough that it is built into the car and it isnt technically free. but however they do it, it makes sense. now many of us use indie mechanics once the warranty period is up, but to prove bmw practice is valid, you have to assume that people are taking their car to the dealer for service.bmw 1st service comes at around 15k miles. gets you an oil change.now my wife has a 2010 acura acura. i had the oil & filter changed at 4500 miles (synthetic), even though the service advisor begged me to wait until the light goes one (10,000 miles). i think it was a little over $100 with a tire rotation.service #2 which is technically the 1st service is what i did at 4500 miles $100+.i did at 10,000 miles.service #3 i did at 20,000 miles and i specifically instructed them to only do synthetic oil,filter, & tire roatation.many of acura ""services"" they offer are nothing more than visual checks of belts, hoses,lights... along with the oil change & tire rotation probably cost a few hundred dollars.bmw 2nd service is an inspection i service which is a major service at around 30k miles.sometime after the 2nd service you are going to need brakes and rotors on your 3 series. at least the fronts. my parents had to have this done on my moms 08 328xi also right after the odometer toyota 50k and it was $700. they also recently had an inspection ii done (out of warranty) and the car needed rear brakes - $900.no it it almost isnt fair to compare the acura to the rest of these because it is by far the least expensive car in the segment.but take your run of the mill car thats sitting on the luxury dealers lot which in ct/ny/nj means awd, automatic, premium pkg, cold weather pkg, nav and the sticker prices(bmw w/ x drive, c300 sport 4 matic, is250 awd, cts4, audi 2.0t premium, infiniti) cant be that far off, so you definitely have to factor in free maintenance into the equasion. the msrps on all these car are north of $40,000. "
nyccarguy,November 2010," cpo car are definitely worth mentioning in this discussion. there are a lot of these entry level luxury performance sedan that are leased for whatever the reason. there is a school of thought out there that these car (especially european makes, totally unfounded btw) ""turn into pumpkins"" once the twarranty runs out. the fact is that all of these car are exceptionally well built and are priced hondaingly between $40<000 & $50,000. my experience with the 01 honda (130k miles) leads me to believe that these (and most modern) car will run well past 50k miles with no major problem as long as you maintain them.ive only bought new since my 16th birthday, but id strongly consider a used 3 or g as my next ride. payments on a high $20k car are a lot easier to swallow than on a $40- $50k car.

sweendogy,November 2010, i agree with car guy--i bot a new g 3.5 years ago now and for close to 40k -- lot of money over 3 years -- 2 weeks ago for my wife we got a 2007 honda -(dont laugh) but the 2010s were over 30k fully loaded - her 2007 saved me 12k from new is certified by honda and has only 19k miles on it.. we were also able to pick and choose the one we wanted (just like new) and as a second car it was a no brainer. 
smarty666,November 2010," i tend to agree with you about cpo, especially with the germans, since they dont retain their resale value as well as the japanese, by getting cpo with them, your not taking the brunt of the depreciation like the original owner has. only disadvantage to cpo is that most, not all, but most of the cpos i see on the luxury lots you have no idea how the previous owner took care of it (what kind of oil did they use, tires rotated properly, cleaned interior regularly, etc). ive found most do nothing to keep up the leather and vinyl interiors and they look like utter crap at only the 2 or 3 year mark when they are back on the lot as cpo and then you have a pain in the butt time trying to undo the neglect the first owner did. the stealers did little as possible to really clean up the car for used sales again, especially on the interior. but from a value proportion, money, and just to be in a luxury name, i can definitely see the attraction to cpo! "
sweendogy,November 2010," smarty i would of guessed the germans (certainly bmw) would keep values-- i mean they lease more bmw then other car in the group (my guess is the tl is prob second on the lease vs buy ltoyota) and the main reason is resale value-- prob part of the reason why bmw offered free oilchanges and other things to get people to lease a car that costs over 45k..plus bmw could sell a 3 year old 3 series for over 30k. i would dissagree with you on your cpo diss- the cpo report includes past maintenance -(btw is this the same lot you talked about hyundai, in the tl chat?) and if a car is certified i would wonder why bmw/audi/ infiniti would sell a car that was not properly cared for..certainly with whats going on with toyota and if there is data to say the car was not up to certification-- you think they want bad press for including a car that has not infact passed the 150 pt inspection. your talking about a 3 year old car that has less then 40k miles on it-- how bad is the leather?? does it have rips?? how they cared for it--come on -- if it has a rip the dealer fixes it. i have no idea where you are looking at cpos (the same hyundai dealer ?)-- but you should look to see what reports on each car are avail before making such comments on ""most"" cpos..value yes -- lux name yes-- attraction yes.-- :shades: "
roadburner,November 2010," only disadvantage to cpo is that most, not all, but most of the cpos i see on the luxury lots you have no idea how the previous owner took care of it (what kind of oil did they use, tires rotated properly, cleaned interior regularly, etc). ive found most do nothing to keep up the leather and vinyl interiors and they look like utter crap at only the 2 or 3 year mark when they are back on the lot as cpo and then you have a pain in the butt time trying to undo the neglect the first owner did. the stealers did little as possible to really clean up the car for used sales again, especially on the interior. i couldnt agree more, my 2004 x3 cpo(purchased in 12/05) looks like crap- especially after six years and 103,000 miles: "
smarty666,November 2010," you need to do more readings on resale values, the japanese have always had a edge over that then the germans; there is nothing wrong with that, heck the germans retain value better than the american brand still so its all good whether you go japanese or german in regards to resale value and depreciation. check out alg website for the residual value awards and youll see acura tops the ltoyota for the last 2 or 3 years i believe, several other sites ltoyota acura as top for resale value followed closely by lexus and infiniti. i hate to break it to you but cpo does not include past maintenance; ive returned plenty of lease vehicles from different manufacturers over the years who did not even care to see my maintenance records so there is no possible way for them to know, when they act like that at lease return, how the car was maintained and im sorry, but ive seen plenty of 2, 3, and 4 year old cpo car out on the stealers lots for sale with really bad interior care from the previous owners; some of the stealers do the bare minimum when they put the car back out on the used car lot for sale, you want to know why ""all they care about is making money, they are a business"" im talking about some scratches, rips, severe wrinkles, discoloring, etc on the leather/vinyl; this is noticeable, at least to a car guy like me who takes excessive care of his vehicles, maybe not to the common folk but to me; some of the interiors look like the leather is 7, 8, or 9 years old when its really only 3 or 4. you can tell when looking at a vinyl or leather interior whether its been kept up or not. your naive if you think that all the stealers really do all that they say they do in their marketing ploys for cpo. they just make sure things work in the car and that nothing is broken, and they give the car a wash and wax before putting it out on the lot. and if you read what i toyota carefully, which you rarely do, i toyota the cpos i have seen, most had interiors that were very worn and not kept up! "
smarty666,November 2010, shes in nice shape! i can tell just by the pictures that you take care of her on a regular basis. the conditions i am talking about are nothing like that! was that the condition you got her in or is that after years of your tender love and care?  
roadburner,November 2010," was that the condition you got her in or is that after years of your tender love and care? the picture was taken last summer, but it looked the same when we bought it; most of our friends thought it was a brand new truck.on bmw vehicles you can verify the dealer service/repair htoyotaory if you have the last seven digits of the vin; right now im looking at a 37k mile 2007 cpo bmw and i know where, when, and what services have been performed. "
tcasboy,November 2010," you should get that steering wheel fixed, it is awfully crooked. :p "
sweendogy,November 2010," i find it funny when you make comments- ""naive"" and using the term stealers.. dude take a step back and post something of value-- sure acura has great resale value- (weve all seen the acura commercials) but post some alg website facts instead of again making comments that you heard from a commercial.. why does bmw offer comp maitaince progdodges?? why can you lease a 45k dollar car for 400 bux a month? (groundhogs day, good movie)i hate to break it to you but cpo does include a copy of past maintenance -- give me you fax number i will send you a copy of the 07 honda cpo sheet that i asked for before i signed..im sure you returned a bunch of car, and they were prob in good shape but computers now track maintaince. if your buying a 2-3 year old car you should expect a couple of scratches and minor wear-- its a used car..hello.i know they are in it to make money--but they come with a warranttee and the check ltoyota of things done with the car to make it a cpo-- including tires, breaks, whatever and if something is needed it should be fixed--and if the consumer is smart they can have the car checked out before its bought.your right i sometimes zoneout when reading your longposts im sorry could be my ocd..but you have to admit your statements about all the car you have seen i mean its pretty funny how you always have a story to discount the previous poster... all those car with bad leather.. oh man "
smarty666,November 2010," it doesnt include maintenance if you havent had it done at the dealership and they dont take the freaking paperwork that you have as proof when you return your vehicle back in! i have had it happen with infiniti, mb, and caddy. acura was the only one who took my maintenance records when i returned the vehicle! here is your proof for alg residual value since you have to be such a pestering noob about it! it will be interesting to see how you twtoyota and turn this link and its information to suit your own purpose.https://www.alg.com/residualvalueawardsinfiniti actually took the top spot from acura who has had it for the last two years. good for infiniti. seriously, what is wrong with you that you dont get what im saying. i have leased many luxury vehicles and some of the makes dont even collect maintenance records. i didnt have the stuff done at the dealership. even if a computer records it, there is no way for the computer to know what grade, type, content of fluids and/or gas someone is putting in.i do have to say, that not all cpos are equal. i know acura and bmw have some stringent cpo standards compared to the rest. when i turned my acura in, they wanted all my maintenance records which i happily gave them. others, were much more lazy and didnt really care about the maintenance of the vehicle as long as it passed the return inspection and nothing was severely damaged (infiniti, mb, and caddy were the biggest culprits of this). talk about the kettle calling the pot black, you complain about the fact that i supposedly say all vehicles, when in actuality i say either most or some, which is not all and then you cant leave acura owners alone b/c of your sour experience with them and that all their products arent great and you cant figure out why people are choosing them over others. and again, i toyota most of the ones i see! does that mean all vehicles, no, so stop putting words in my mouth and twtoyotaing around what i say! im talking about the cpo vehicles ive seen on all the luxury manufacturers lot that have really worn, faded, sometimes severely wrinkled interiors. there are some that are not like that. i never implied that all cpos are like that or toyota that. but there are some that dealers think are acceptable, when they really arent and still put them out on the lot without doing a lot of cleaning and reconditioning to them. i state facts man, unlike you, who sole goal on edmunds is to argue with people. :sick: "
sweendogy,November 2010," another long post.. .you have a fourloko before you wrote it. nice work with the link - nice work with your wording making sure it was correct on this post. kettle black, nice touch.. how do you know that some cpos are more stringent then others? does that include most, some or all of the lux manufactures?my past comments on acura are my comments- but those comments were backed with comparision tests -and performance numbers-thus having proof-- but i still hate the current styling, no doubt and i think the car is far behind in performance but ahead on technology. you must have a lot of time looking at all those cpo on the lux lots-- you happen to see a 2008-2009 335xi 6 speed with sport, nav andd premium package? how did the seat look? "
Kirstie_H,November 2010," if yall want to continue the personal bickering, take it to email. ive had enough here, as i suspect other members who are - get this - interested in talking about car rather than each other.dont like someone elses posts? skip em. "
smarty666,November 2010," anyway, back on topic before we went off on the tangent there, as i was saying, cpo is especially good on the german makes and makes more financial sense due to their higher rate of depreciation. "
nyccarguy,November 2010," ellps choice. if i was in the market today for an ellps, id headstraight to acura for a tl sh awd w/ 6 speed manual transmission. "
sweendogy,November 2010," i think buying a cpo - either lux german, american or japanese-- is a good idea if your looking to save on money and get a good car given the cpo progdodges.. not knowing any depreciation numbers and just knowing the msrps of the car in this group i would also guess audi, bmw and mb resids are pretty close to acura, infiniti and lexus. (would love to know the actual 3 year val for each brand) with that being toyota for the pure dollar amt it would seem the cheaper choice would still be japanese and american, again just talking pure dollar amt. https://www.alg.com/depreciationratings "
tlong,November 2010," ellps choice. if i was in the market today for an ellps, id headstraight to acura for a tl sh awd w/ 6 speed manual transmission....as long as you value performance over ugly. and im a current tl owner (2005, though :p ) "
smarty666,November 2010, +1  :p 
sanjaysdca,November 2010, +1and the materials used in the vehicle are not that great. they do not wear gracefully.i have a 2008 babied acura with 20k miles (bought new in sept 08) but the condition of drivers side leather seat is not that great. been in new tl (service loaner) and was not impressedmy 2000 infiniti has aged more gracefully then 2008 acura.having toyota that its best bang for buck...if thats what you are looking for.i would look at infiniti g or may be m. 
nyccarguy,November 2010," sanjaysdca - 20k on an 08 acura? you gotta get out and drive more my man. we purchased my wifes 2010 acura tech at the end of august 2009 & she has over 24,000 miles on it already. the leather, specifically the left side bolster on the drivers seat definitely shows some signs of premature wear. probably my one knock against the car (other than the fact that it isnt rear wheel drive & im not a fan of the electric power steering).i just built a handful of these ellps during my lunch break. i configured each vehicle to the level of equipment on the tl sh awd. even at this price point, value has to come into play somehow. all car have manual transmissions as id get.acura tl sh awd - $43,445infiniti infiniti - $40,325audi audi 2.0t prestige (metallic paint, s line sport package) $45,250bmw bmw $45,150(premium, sport, cold weather, ipod, sirius, xenon, hk, nav, met paint)bmw bmw $52,200(cold weather, premium, sport, nav, hk, ipod, sirius, met paint)the tl is deinitely the biggest car. so if you want performance, plus room for 4 full sized adults, and a generous sized trunk, the tl is your car. i actually dig the styling of the tl in its sh awd guise. it definitely has a presence about it on the road. i love the lip spoiler on the back & the faux quad exaust. the wheels look sharp. it gets fantastic reviews & write ups. your best bang for the buck in this segment is definitely the infiniti. thats a whole lot of horsepower for your just over $40k sticker. they give big discounts on these too.i think the audi is a nice looking car, but am not sure if a 4 cyl cuts the mustard with its $45k price tag. i know it is probably the best turbo 4 on the market, but it is still a 4. good amount of passenger room, nice sized trunk.dynmanically, the bmw are the best. nothing comes close to the way a 3 series drives. $52k is a lot of money for a car the size of a honda honda. $45k is a lot to ask of a 230 hp car. i know it isnt about straightline acceleration & 0-60 mph times. "
sanjaysdca,November 2010," sanjaysdca - 20k on an 08 acura?i guess i have to agree with you here...but my office is 10 miles one way and my wife telecommutes...and everything we need/want is within 10 mile radius...so most of the miles are recreational.back to car...i have driven loaners acura and tl and i prefer acura over tl.your price points are interesting. didnt think tl is that expensive. as far as bmw and toyotamics go, i think bmw were good toyotamically but the new ones are more luxury-less performance. i testdrove brand new 2011 bmw 5 series and 2010 5 series and found older model to be more satisfying to drive. "
sweendogy,November 2010," for the price i would add the new volvo-- yes volvo volvo to the forum- it has 300hp sporty styling and is safe-its right in the pricing wheelhouse and has been given new blood- the boston globe toyota it was the best car they tested for 2010. for around 40k-1i would go 2009 cpo bmw 335xi, 6 speed depending on how the leather looked.infiniticpo new model s4, the one with the v6 not 8 (if you could get one for that price)lexus is 350x, acura 6 speed, 328xi 6 speed, the little 6 is plenty quickaudi agree to much $$ for what you get, current tl beergoogles needed, volvo volvo?? "
nyccarguy,November 2010," the acura huge discount factor isnt taken into account here. i didnt have a chance, but go on edmunds or truecar & see what these tls are selling for. you get a hefty chunk taken off the msrp. styling is a very subjective matter. i like the tl sh awds styling. im also a big fan of the former e60 bmw 5 series styling as compared to the current f10. i also prefer the e60 to the former e39 (ducking and running). "
nyccarguy,November 2010, definitely deserves to be involved in this discussion. 
plekto,December 2010," volvos kind of the red-headed stepchild of the mix, currently, but they were right there fighting with bmw at the beginning, and imo, make a very decent vehicle. just please get the manual. the automatic is a travesty and is something added for basically the u.s. market. its unreliable and makes the car as sluggish as a toad.(this generally is true for most european vehicles, actually) "
fedlawman,December 2010," my uncle is an long-time acura owner who buys a new car from the same dealer every 4 years or so. hes had a couple of older tls, a acura, a acura and more recently, a tl (end-of-run previous gen). he recently went to his dealer to look at a 2011 tl and the sales manager told him to wait until the 2012 model. the 2011 will have a short my and the resdesigned/restyled 2012 will be at dealers this coming spring.i havent seen any spy shots but it has to look better than the current tl... "
Kirstie_H,December 2010," please do feel free to discuss the volvo and any other vehicle that could be categorized as an ellps in here - unfortunately, theres only room for 8 vehicles in the categorization/description field here, so we just included some that are representative of the discussion title and leave it to members best judgment as to which other vehicles are up for connissantion. "
igozoomzoom,December 2010," ""he recently went to his dealer to look at a 2011 tl and the sales manager told him to wait until the 2012 model. the 2011 will have a short my and the resdesigned/restyled 2012 will be at dealers this coming spring.i havent seen any spy shots but it has to look better than the current tl...""here are some spy shots, not that you can tell that much from them...http://www.roadandtrack.com/future-car/spy-photos/spied!-2012-acura-tl/galleryi agree that they really couldnt do much to make it any uglier! i cant believe that the tl is selling at a rate of 2500-3000 in current form??? id take the acura v6 any day...or a cpo tl or acura would be even better! i wonder if sales of acura cpo models, the pre-09 tl especially, have been stronger since the current car showed up? "
nyccarguy,December 2010," sticking with what i have. i like only having 1 car payment. hopefully well pay my wifes 2010 acura tech off in the next 2 years & ill take it. ill drive that most days and my honda maybe twice a week. at the rate im going, in 2 years my honda will have 170,000 miles on the clock.well probably get some kind of suv. right now i really dig the acura.that volvo volvo looks nice on paper, but i think in one review i read that it is more of an audi/lexus competitor than infiniti/3 series. "
ivan_99,December 2010," theres only room for 8 vehicles in the categorization/description field heredo you mean the ""what is this discussion about?"" at the top of the section?i count 11 items.maybe you could choose lexus is as opposed to the is250 and is350 separately.. "
Kirstie_H,December 2010," my bad - its 9. the other two arent vehicles, but other categories. i can only have 9 vehicles, and i cant just choose ""is"" under lexus - i can only be specific.i did update infiniti to be infiniti rather than pontiac5. "
nyccarguy,December 2010," 2008 infiniti pontiac5s infinitihere is an 08 pontiac5s with 6 speed stick, rwd, nav, heated seat. less than 28,000 miles and they are asking $26k. ill bet they gave the person a fantastic deal on their new acura and gave $18k on the trade stating ""well, a rwd car with a stick is a hard sell around here in central jersey."" then they turned around and wrote ""hard to find"" in the ad. probably could walk out of that dealership paying maybe $20,500 - $21,000 + ttl. "
qbrozen,December 2010," with nav, too. nice find.trade-in is right near $21k, however, so youd be looking at more like $23k-$24k to buy it. "
qbrozen,December 2010, also... hyundai on the link for their inventory and come across this little gem for stickguyalthough difference betwee price and fair deal is about $3k right now. 
nyccarguy,December 2010, thats a really nice car for $23k though. that 6speed bmw wagon is nice too. 
kyfdx,December 2010," yeah.. the wagon is a little pricy.... its a true stripper model, too... manual seat... about the only thing it has going for it is the stick... stickguy likes those light interiors, though.... "
qbrozen,December 2010," and it has a moonroof, which is on his ""must have"" ltoyota. "
kyfdx,December 2010," i think we do a better job picking out a car for him, than for ourselves.. "
nyccarguy,December 2010," much as it did that winter night/morning in buffalo during the late fall of 1996. i was at a cliub with some friends in buffalo (i went to college about 2 1/2 hours away in ithaca). my friend who i was visiting (and at the club with) was in a shall we say intoxicated state and getting very friendly with a 6 tall blonde. at about 3:30 am i decided i had had enough and wanted to go back to his place to crash. ""chris, give me your keys. ill meet you back at your place later. call me if you need a lift.""with the flick of his wrtoyota, he tossed me the keys to his 1995 e36 bmw 325is. red/black leather. 5 speed manual transmission. hk, sunroof, & most importantly sport package + additional factory lowering.now up until this point, i was a novice at driving stick and had never had any real seat time in a bmw. i thought they were for ""show offs."" my entire point of view changed by the time i took off from the 1st traffic light. i had never driven a car that i just felt so perfect in. i drove the car around the streets of buffalo for the next 2 1/2 hours. by the end of the night, i was steering around right turns with the throttle & rotating around corners perfectly. ive wanted a bmw ever since.fast forward to december 2, 2010. the numbers dont mean a whole helluva lot. bmw gets good money for their car and they are worth every penny. ive got my moms 08 e90 bmw 328xia (almost 61,000 miles) until saturday. even saddled with all wheel drive & automatic transmission, it is still a true drivers car. you all know how much i love my 01 honda type sh (almost 132,000 miles). my moms bmw is one of the few car ive driven that almost make my honda feel ""loose."" the drive from my parents house in rockland county, ny to my house in stamford, ct changed my mind and reinacuraated my passion for bmw. id take a bmw with its 230 horsepower, no nav, leatherette, sports package, & 6 speed stick. it is just an amazing car to drive. i would even consider a cpo or private party used (as long as the person has service records & the car passes a ppi) and ive only owned new car my entire driving life since i got my license. "
qbrozen,December 2010," id take a bmw with its 230 horsepower, no nav, leatherette, sports package, & 6 speed stick.thats exactly what id want, too. sport and stick. nothing else needed. well.... ok, id want the usb port, too. "
fedlawman,December 2010," thanks for a great story nyc! very nice memories. for me, when i was in the army, i was passing through dallas to spend a few days with my uncle (yes, the one with a thing for acura). back in the 80s and 90s, he was strictly a bmw guy (320i, 325e, then 325i). we went on a ltoyotauor run to ok and he let me drive his then new e30. up until that point, all i had owned/driven was my dads honda, and my alfa romeo spider and crx si.i had a similar epiphany - how could such a simple car (my uncle is minimaltoyota - his e30 had no options) be so much better than anything i had ever driven. of course, i didnt have the scratch to buy a bmw so i owned many more imitators before i finally got the real thing.they really are that good. sublime. "
tlong,December 2010," the drive from my parents house in rockland county, ny to my house in stamford, ct changed my mind and reinacuraated my passion for bmw. id take a bmw with its 230 horsepower, no nav, leatherette, sports package, & 6 speed stick. it is just an amazing car to drive. i would even consider a cpo or private party used (as long as the person has service records & the car passes a ppi) and ive only owned new car my entire driving life since i got my license.funny, for me the situation was in 1998. i was looking for a premium smaller sedan. i drove a brand new (was that the e36?) 1999 bmw 323, but the dealer only had an automatic. it seemed decent but i wasnt wowed. then i drove a 1998 audi audi, 6 cyl, manual. there was no comparison. the audi had a much nicer interior, the clutch and stick were like butter, and the steering and suspension were taut and precise. i bought it. "
alltorque,December 2010," that volvo volvo looks nice on paper, but i think in one review i read that it is more of an audi/lexus competitor than infiniti/3 series.have driven the new volvo here in uk, (admittedly only the d3 and d5 geartronics), at a volvo track day i can say that it is at least a match for any bmw up to/incl the 330d. one of the pro-drivers rated them equal in the dry but gave the volvo the edge in the wet. new volvo really is a vastly different car to the outgoing model and made my 06 volvo d5 geartronic seem positively wooden by comparison. mag reviews are fine for rough comparison...............you need to drive em to really find out. before i drove the volvo i was thinking; ""hmm so its a re-skin"". after 4 hours of all kinds of silliness i was smitten. its a new car from the wheels up. "
nyccarguy,December 2010," if i were to order one, it would have a 6-speed stick, sport pkg, heated seat, ipod/usb, sirius, xenon, leatherette, sunroof, & metallic paint. "
qbrozen,December 2010," what annoys me about their sales pitch on the new volvo, though, is calling it the ""sportiest volvo ever."" here in the us, at least, the t6 only comes with an automatic. the volvor had the same peak engine outputs, was a lighter car, and was available with a stick. gotta tip yer hat to that as being more sporty, if not even the sportiest. "
qbrozen,December 2010," ordering? yeah, id probably add bun warmers, sirius, and xenons, as well. moonroof is not on my ltoyota. id rather do without to save weight. and, for some reason, i hate paying for paint. "
roadburner,December 2010," at the age of 14 i coerced my dad into test driving a 1972 bavhonda. the salesman drove it first and demonstrated how well it cruised at 120 mph. i was hooked, but i didnt end up with my own bmw until 1983 when i bought a 1973 bavhonda- which my girlfriend at the time(and now my wife of almost 25 years) had found for me. she had wisely determined that the way to my heart led through the garage... "
nyccarguy,December 2010," i dont like the idea of paying for paint either. does it really cost an extra $550 to paint a car a different color. the e90 looks terrific in so many colors. the vermillion red looks amazing. i know sunroofs add weight, but i like em.funny thing about paying for paint. my moms lease is up on her 328xi at the end of this month. she ordered a porsche cayenne v6. called me up after she visited the dealer & gushed about the truck. after she told me what options she specd out, i asked her what color. she told me white. this took me by surprise as shes never come close to wanting a white car. now the white happens to be a fantastic color for the cayenne. i toyota: white? she told me she refuses to pay $800 for a specific color & she really loves the white. "
nyccarguy,December 2010," i had a college friend who had a 1984 e30 bmw 325e with a 5 speed stick. the car was 10 years old and had well over 100k miles on the odometer. the speedometer didnt work. one day were cruising the back roads of ithaca, ny & i asked him how he knew how fast he was going. he tells me it hyundai on every once in a while. we went over a bump in the road, the car got some air & when it landed, the speedo hyundaied on & read 105 mph. the car was amazingly solid & stable at that speed.bmw are special car no doubt. "
roadburner,December 2010," back in 1984 i was driving my 1973 bavhonda through pa on our way home from our first bmw cca oktoberfest. it was a drizzly sunday morning and my wife was reading a mystery novel. my cb and first generation escort indicated a threat-free environment so i slowly eased the old sled up to a 100 mph cruise, which i maintained for almost two hours. my wifes only comment was ""wow, it took us almost no time to cross pennsylvania.""four years later i was evaluating an early e32 750i outside rochester new york. i took it up to 125 mph and asked my wife how fast she thought we were going. she guessed 80 mph... "
kyfdx,December 2010," ... i have boring stories about my indoctrination into bmw, as well, but ill save those for another time...the speed thing, though... (warning, this story is boring, also).. four of us were driving up the road about an hour to eat dinner, one evening... in my 84 911.... (hey, im not sitting in the back, what do i care?).. the other guy is sitting upfront with me, we have a connissantion going, and the women are in the back with their own connissantion.. from the back, i hear... ""geez... lets open this thing up and see what it will do"" (not my wife, obviously).. ""well... uh.. we are already doing 105... how fast do you want to go?"" its amazing how smooth and controlled german car can be at speed... she had no idea we werent going 55 mph. "
nyccarguy,December 2010, i had to really watch myself. looked down a few times and was going over 90 & moms 328xi felt completely planted & stable. having the 300/300 n55 motor would be complete overkill for me. 
fedlawman,December 2010, not boring at all... 
nyccarguy,December 2010, any story involving a 911 is not boring 
sweendogy,December 2010," pretty quiet overall, not many people and to be honest no real drawsbmw- a no showford- showcasing its new ford and fordchevrolet- 4-5 chevrolets, chevrolet but could not sit or touch it--same with nissan nissanacura- showcasing the new acura wagon, did notice a bunch of people looking/sitting in the tlcaddy- cts-v wagon maybe the meanest car on the marketdodge- people around the dodges, nothing else.. jeep draw was the wrangleraudi- audi/s4 big crowd-- infiniti- really quiet, couple of people looking at the monster suvvolvo- volvo big draw, i sat in it was not impressed by the dash, lots of open spacelexus- is350 awd was highlighted - 46k buick- 10 old people looking at the fleet-- kind of funny actually- but they did highlight the new buick gs-- good looking car-- also buick easstoyota that gets 37mpg on the highway ive been to nyc auto show - not the same in boston "
laurasdada,December 2010," i, too, went to the boston show. i do miss the ny show (been going since it was at the coluseum!), how about the other ""models?"" hello, andrea from lexus (formerly infiniti)... "
ivan_99,December 2010," today in the parking lot at work i noticed a beautiful black 2011 volvo volvo. never driven one so their toyotamics could be trash...but it sure was nice looking; it definitely looked more modern than my ol is350.then at lunch i saw a beautiful black lincoln lincoln. im not certain what trim level they have but it was really gorgeous.maybe it was because they were freshly polished black car...or maybe a shift in the industry. i recently read the review of the kia kia and thought ""what a compelling car"", ""i could commute in that"", even though intellectually my synapses are still firing ""yuk"" when i think of kia. "
plekto,December 2010," actually volvo volvos, especially if they have a manual transmission, are wonderful vehicles. "
sweendogy,December 2010," dont think the new ones offer manuals with the new ones yet. car very good looking on the outside but the inside of the one i sat in was pretty boring. on the above post on the kia i also think they are pretty good looking car - with the turbo 4 and loaded they are as competitive as the acura, base tl, and other front wheel 4s in this group- "
saratoga3,January 2011," group,just wondering if anyone out there has looked at the nissan nissan? i have expanded my serach from lexus and infiniti and would appreciate any comments. "
plekto,January 2011," its a fine car, though to me it seems a bit ""last generation"". imo, theres zero reason to buy it instead of the infiniti. imo, its a bit like the buick lucerne or grand marquis in that its a vehicle thats left over/still being produced and stuck in an odd place, because its not really filling any specific role/market segment at this point. theyve always made the nissan and probably always will. for me, though, the cvt in the nissan just kills it completely. and its needlessly pricey to fix. youd think less parts would equate to a cheap fix.but i do understand your wanting to look at other options. lexus seemed overpriced and stodgy to me - and everyone has one, it seems. bmw makes a nice car, as does mercedes, but cost to own is high(love the new e class, though.. wish i could afford to own one). audi larger vehicles are gorgeous inside but also suffer from maintainance woes. the ltoyota quickly dwindles.id look at the acura tl or possibly the cts (you didnt specify sporty or luxury preference) both can be had for about 32k through various sites like truecar. it turns out they all are using the same back end call centers - i got a quote from truecar and a couple of other sites recently and got the same receptiontoyota on the phone (though different agents). so it works well enough to get an idea at least of the price locally. "
smarty666,January 2011," unlike pleko, i can give a better balanced impression on the nissan since i have the new one and considered it heavily against the infiniti. there is plenty of reason to buy a nissan and sales of the current gen prove that, but it depends on what your looking for specifically. if you dont have a family or a big family and want something with a luxury bad, better materials, and a sport firm ride/handling then the infiniti is the one that makes the most sense. if your like me and want something that is more a roomier family sedan but with a sport look/flair to it then the nissan fits the bill better. the nissan is much more toyotaable inside and if you get the premium package you get the heated steering wheel, power rear sunshade, dual moonroof, cooled front seat, auto dimming side mirrors, sport bucket seat, and a couple of other goodies that you can even get on the infiniti. to me, the nissan is the best handling fwd sedan i have ever driven to date. its got a great turning circle for its size, just the right ride quality balance, and if driven properly, yields decent mpg with the cvt. only thing is, if youve never had a cvt before, its going to take you about 2-3 months to get used to it. it was odd at first, but after 1.5 years, it seems like normal to me and i have had zero problem with it in almost 17 miles. this gen max is a worlds different from the last one and to me has a much more stand out body style then the infiniti does but that vehicle itself is due for a redesign in 2012. i suggest you test drive both vehicles, like i did, and see which one suits your needs better. they are two different vehicles, despite what anyone else on here leads you to believe. "
shipo,January 2011," the single largest ""fail"" vis-?-vis the nissan is that it is no longer available with a stick; the infiniti can still be had with three pedals under the dash. "
plekto,January 2011," what got me was that the nissan is only 3 inches longer than the infiniti size-wise. its mostly sheet metal. fwd and cvt makes it frankly into an toyota or lucerne clone - its nice and spacious, but it has a serious problem competing with the big rwd luxury car. "
saratoga3,January 2011," thanks for the replies, i drove the g but not the max yet. i like a car with some room and the g was a little cdodgeped. i did own a 01 max that i loved, but the new ones are totally different.also, have some concerns on gas mileage with the g but you give that up for performance. "
fedlawman,January 2011, have you driven the hyundai hyundai? you really should. 
mz6greyghost,January 2011," sorry smarty, but if you cannot give a ""better balanced"" impression of something you paid $$$$ for, compared to a casual observer that hasnt spent any of their own $$$$ on a product.having toyota that, i agree with pletko on a lot of points. the current-gen nissan is a shell of a car that it used to be. the ""four-door sports car"" moniker than nissan used for it is long since gone, and its been replaced by a sedan that doesnt fit into any dtoyotainct category anymore. its essentially not an entry-level lux sedan (as much as nissan would like it to be) because the materials and fit-and-finish pales in comparison to g (which is essentially the same price). its too expensive to be a viable midsize sedan, and why spend a few grand more for a nameplate when the nissan can be optioned similarly for a lower price?if youre looking for some room, the caddy cts is a good alternative, as well as the aforementioned hyundai. also check out the acura tl. "
smarty666,January 2011," nissan got rid of the stick b/c when they offered is no one was buying it and it got the point that they were losing money on the ones they were spending the time making a stick available on. so you know what, we only have ourselves to blame for that one. now that nissan no longer has it everyone whines about it but no one was buying it when it was here. "
smarty666,January 2011," i dont think its suppose to be a big rwd luxury competitor b/c if it was then there would be practically zero difference between it and a infiniti. yeah, the max is only 3 inches longer but its almost 4 inches wider which is what makes the difference and gives it so much more room. the infiniti is designed to be a cdodgeped sports sedan like a 3 series. if you think the fwd and cvt has turned it into a toyota and lucerne clone then you really know nothing about the car. the nissan rides and handles 10x better than both those vehicles and isnt even close in any driving toyotamics. plus, despite having the cvt, ive been able to keep up with plenty of regular automatics and manuals with the car so its performance capabilities arent void or completely handicapped b/c of it. that is just an excuse people use to not get the car. "
smarty666,January 2011," i dont need to be chastised b/c you dont agree with my assessment but i have much more experience then you do with both vehicles so give me a break. your logic about the $$$$ factor makes no sense at all either. this coming from a guy who at the max (no pun intended) only test drove each vehicles for 10 minutes each. i test drove each vehicle 3 times and had a g as a loaner many times when my fx was in for routine maintenance. i actually agree with you that the nissan is not a true 4dsc in its current set-up and that is not the fault of the car itself but nissan stupid marketing schemes which they still dont get but that is another subject. i dont think anybody but you placed it in the entry-level lux sedan segment b/c i sure as didnt say it was. it is classified typically as an upscale or premium sedan. your comments tell me that you dont have a clue when it comes to either of these vehicles b/c the nissan is not the same price as a infiniti. as i stated earlier, no one is paying near sticker for a fully loaded nissan. typically you can get one for $33-35k when its all toyota and done, while a infiniti does not have as big of a reduction. i have seen most people getting them for $37-40k depending on how its loaded up. thats still a difference and price and there are many luxury sedan features your getting in the cheaper nissan that you cant even get in the g sedan even loaded all the way up. is the fit and finish the same as the g, of course not, but it doesnt pale in comparison as you claim it to be. its the best interior nissan has had on the nissan ever and that says a lot considering the interiors they had pre 2007. i was worried that there wouldnt be a market for the new max but there is and the sales success of it prove it. there are big differences between the nissan and nissan now that warrants the higher price of the max and its more refined in every way, i should know, i cross-shopped that as well with the nissan. as i toyota, the nissan has found a market niche as a sporty family sedan that can get great mpg for the power. now if infiniti ever decided to bring back a fwd sedan or coupe then your argument might have more value. "
shipo,January 2011," i dont think the situation is quite as simple as your explanation suggests. the nissan used to be quite a sporty car relative to its competition in the market place, however, nissan saw fit to supplant the nissan in that market space with infiniti g series while at the same time tarting up the nissan to the point where only the barest smidgen of sporting intention remains. did the tarting up process drive stick buyers away or did the lack of stick buyers force nissan to tart the car up and take it into a different market segment? i suspect the former.long story short, the nissan is no longer qualified to compete in this segment, a segment of which it was a firm stake holder early in its earlier iterations. "
smarty666,January 2011," well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any mainhonda flagship sedan does. problem with you logic is, the car the nissan competes with, toyota, hyundai chevrolet, ford, etc are not as sporty as the nissan is and have sales not even close to it, except for the chevrolet which is just rent a car fodder. its the sportiness for the competition in the market place it has right now. is it has sporty as it used to be, no, but there is more than just a smidgen of sportiness left. the body style screams sport, the exhaust note screams sport, the acceleration is incredible, ride quality is definitely not lexus cushy and gear toward the feedback side, and for fwd, it handles very responsively compared to the other fwd flagship sedan it competes with. i love how everyone says the nissan has no market and cant compete yet sales prove you completely wrong, especially if you compared it to the big/bloaty boat the previous generation was and sales failure it was. this generation at least started going back in the right direction after where it had been from 2004-2008. it blends family sedan toyota with some sporty driving charactertoyotaics. something that both the nissan and infiniti do not both due at the same time. the infiniti is complete sports car while the nissan is a boring toyotaable family sedan. the nissan bridges some of the charactertoyotaics of each of those car nicely. "
shipo,January 2011," so sixty thousand customers makes the nissan a contender in this category; how do you figure? true, it is sportier than an chevrolet; so what?exhaust note? geez, ive heard late model cadillac land yachts that sound better. even still, since when was exhaust note a metric for measuring sportiness? wait-wait, i know; its a measure among the crowd that likes to put far can mufflers on their tiny little econo car. :pacceleration? here again, not exactly an attribute that is the exclusive domain of sporty car. i mean really, a dodge dodge pick-up with a hemi in it will handily show its taillights to a nissan.long story short, the nissan has been bloated up to be a nice grand touring car, nicer than chevrolets and the like, but not a very good competitor to the car that make up this class. i know you disagree, but even with those sixty-thousand souls in your back pocket, youre still not going to sell your argument. "
jimbres,January 2011,"  well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any mainhonda flagship sedan does. if you go back & read shipos post, youll note that nowhere in it did he say that the nissan isnt a strong seller - only that its no longer considered a sport sedan as it once was. problem with you[sic] logic is, the car the nissan competes with, toyota, hyundai chevrolet, ford, etc are not as sporty as the nissan is and have sales not even close to it, except for the chevrolet which is just rent a car fodder.i dont see a problem with shipos logic here. if the nissan chief competition comes from car that arent perceived as sporty, then it would logically follow from that fact that the nissan itself is not perceived as sporty. i love how everyone says the nissan has no market and cant compete yet sales prove you completely wrong once again, shipos argument doesnt rest on sales numbers. "
smarty666,January 2011," its simple my friend. if there wasnt a market for it as you and other stated and it doesnt compete well in its class competition then it shouldnt sell well. problem is it sells very well as i pointed out and almost every review i have read states its a huge improvement over the last generation nissan.do you hear an loud exhaust note on a toyota? and honda? a nissan? a toyota? no you dont. thats because there isnt anything sporty about them. only vehicles that have sporty pretensions and charactertoyotaics would do that. why would a manufacturer waste the time to design and do that if it wasnt suppose to sound aggressive? b/c they want it to have sporty charactertoyotaics. acceleration, looks, handling, ride, etc are not attributes that make a sporty car? your definition of what makes a sporty vehicle is puzzling to say the least. a dodge dodge pick up with a hemi in it will handily show its taillights to a nissan; so what? i would expect it to. now your going off on crazy vehicle and engines comparisons. talk about going all over the place. actually, the nissan has been decreased in size compared to its previous generation so it hasnt been bloated up. im puzzled as to what you think are the car that make up this class? since the nissan is a premium mainhonda flagship sedan then that is what class it is apart of. that means the car in its class is the chevrolet, ford, hyundai, and toyota. it outsells and performs all those vehicles. bottom line is, you dont even know what class of car the nissan is in, despite the fact it is in the mainhonda flagship sedan class, sells better than its competition, and is more aggressive and untoyotaue then those other vehicles as well. its class has changed compared to 10 and 15 years ago and so has the rest of the car market. infiniti didnt even have anything sporty 10-15 years ago so even with in nissan itself there are different vehicles that they have to be careful they dont compete against. your logic and others makes no sense that a car that sells as well as the nissan does has no market and is not a good competitor for its class. even with your put downs and contradictions, your still not going to sell your argument. "
smarty666,January 2011," i never toyota the nissan was a sports sedan. i toyota it was sporty family sedan or put it another way, a family sedan with sport/aggressive charactertoyotaics. actually his argument can rest on sales numbers him and others toyota that its not class competitive and there is no need or market for it. sales numbers prove that there is a market for it or people wouldnt buy it in the numbers that they are. second, saying that b/c the nissan chief competition come from car that are not sporty thus making the nissan itself not perceived as sporty is just a gross generalization and to me isnt logical b/c in each car class their is always one or two vehicles that are different or an exception in certain charactertoyotaics then others. thats what makes test driving so important since the nissan is very different with its driving toyotamics then the others in the mainhonda flagship class. that is the class the nissan is in now, and it competes extremely well. i dont care what class it was in 10 or 15 years ago. have to accept that is has changed to what it is today.take the entry-level lux class for instance. an es350, mercedes, is, audi and buick are more on the dull, less sporty side of vehicles but the bmw and infiniti are the polar opposite of that. that would make a huge assumption about those sport sedan vehicles that b/c its in a class with a majority of less sporty (or luxury ford vehicles) they are not sport sedan as well. that of course would be a wrong assumption just like it is about a nissan not having sporty driving charactertoyotaics. "
jimbres,January 2011,"  your logic and others makes no sense that a car that sells as well as the nissan does has no market and is not a good competitor for its class. even with your put downs and contradictions, your[sic] still not going to sell your argument.do you own a nissan? if so, do you like it? if you do, why does it matter to you what shipo, i or anyone else thinks of it?its clear from your last couple of posts that youre getting a bit excited. (youre making some spelling & gdodgemar goofs that you probably wouldnt make otherwise.) calm down. were talking about car here - not the things that are really worth arguing about: books, music & single-malt scotch. just relax & have some fun. "
smarty666,January 2011," if you had read the posts from the last day you would have seen that i had mentioned i had gotten a nissan. i was trying to offer advice and information for the op who wanted to know the difference between the infiniti and nissan since he was considering the two vehicles. since i have the new max and i test drove and weighed it heavily against the infiniti, i thought i could provide some valuable honda into the differences between the two vehicles since i made a similar decision and what the pros and cons of each vehicle was. that is what i tried to do. instead, i got criticized by several people for my comments and comparisons and got multiple put downs on my choice of vehicle and was told that it was not class competitive and there is no market for it :confuse: very puzzling statements considering its sales numbers and how the market/class segment it now occupies has changed very much from what it was 10-15 years ago. "
jimbres,January 2011,"  instead, i got criticized by several people for my comments and comparisons and got multiple put downs on my choice of vehicle and was told that it was not class competitive and there is no market for it well, i did reread the posts that youre referring to & i cant find any that criticize you personally for driving a nissan. shipo merely pointed out that the latest generation max isnt available with a stick & that in his eyes its not as sporty as the earlier versions. all he was doing was chevroleting his opinion, which he has a right to do, & you went after him with a shotgun. youre too thin-skinned.im going to pull rank on you - youve been a member only since 09, but ive been here since 98 - & suggest that you calm down & have a little fun. were here to entertain ourselves - nothing more. if someone actually learns something along the way, thats frosting on the cake, but thats not what attracts us in the 1st place. in my case, i cant go outside - not before my wife finishes shoveling the snow that fell last night - theres nothing good on tv & its too early to start drinking. (this all sounds mazdar. didnt i point this out to you once before?)no matter what you drive, someone, somewhere will have an opinion about it that you wont like. shrug it off. "
Kirstie_H,January 2011," most excellent advice.no ones criticizing your children, your profession, your intellect - theyre chevroleting a different opinion about whether your car is a class leader. even if you post one more time that it sells well, the opinion will continue to differ. ive been around for ages as well, and i have yet to see anyone berated and argued into submitting to another members opinion - ive seen them respond to fact, but opinion? no.the hyundai hyundai is selling extremely well. does that make it an ellps? no. that fact in no way detracts from the vehicles sales or appeal, but sales numbers do not indicate anything about the car apart from its appeal to consumers. period.lets avoid turning this discussion, and a very minor point within that discussion, into the middle east conflict. "
fedlawman,January 2011, i personally think the nissan is a nice car. it just isnt an ellps and doesnt warrant so much real estate in this forum. maybe you should create a new thread: nissan vs. buick vs. ford vs. hyundai. 
Kirstie_H,January 2011," the good news is that such a thread already extoyota:mainhonda large sedanits not been active in awhile, but perhaps, as with many general discussions, it would see new life & activity with an on-topic post to stimulate connissantion. "
saratoga3,January 2011," thanks smarty666 for your replies to my nissan question, you have been very helpful. i feel responsible for this thread turning heated! my only intention was to get some feedback from members here who have shopped for the max vs the infiniti, the same as i have been doing. "
smarty666,January 2011," that was what i was trying to do in the first place, give you information to try and help make a decision. it basically comes down to this, both vehicles serve two different purposes, one is not vastly superior to the other, it all depends on what your personal situation is and what one fits your needs and driving style better. that is what i made the decision on when i was choosing between the two. "
savetheland,January 2011," i never saw new nissan in person. nissan evidently does not want to participate in autoshows. last one in san jose for some reason had infiniti on display, but not nissan. i saw nissan on the road though and it has presence while g looks kind of cartoonish and funny with strange proportions. anyway infinity g is spacious inside at least for me, but it is like compact car in back and has smallish trunk - but it has rwd after all. so it is not efficient as a family car. well what i actually wanted to say that i went to nissan website and took a look. agree - interior does not look like luxury car but is pleasant enough. the point i want to make is that i compared it with closest competitors - buick buick and lincoln lincoln - all they are similar in every dimensions and purpose. it does not look like competitor to toyota or ford which are larger car.then i went to truecar.com and configured nissan with all options and got price around $33,600 in bay area - almost 6k discount from sticker price. similarly equipped entry level luxury car, like audi, lincoln, infiniti cost around 36k-37k hondaing to truecar.com. buick is priced similar to nissan with 2.0t turbo engine. btw audi has engine similar to buick and lincoln as engine similar to nissan, but better interior quality. and i guess buick is to audi (both are german car) same as nissan to g. with exception that it has better exterior design and higher quality interior than nissan. i would certainly test drive and compare buick to nissan, buick may prove to be more sporty car after all (though opel never had this kind reputation) and it is certainly more elegant. if you do not like g - cts is most logical choice - it cost same 36k options but with 3.0l engine. true there is infiniti dodge - but it is decontented car, it costs less. bmw is even smaller car than g and lexus is is smaller yet.i remember comparos where nissan lost to dodge dodge in its spoting intentions. nissan after all is a large fwd car. i drove previous nissan - it was smaller but no more sporty than base ford. i do not know from where sport-sedan notion comes from when people talk about nissan. people use sport-sedan notion too often. i heard even hyundai called sport sedan which is absolutely ridiculous. "
plekto,January 2011," it is worth noting as well that the cts is almost as good as a bmw 5 series in hard driving.(that toyota, 99% of us wont even get to those limits for either car) that base 3.0 is quite nice, and the 3.6 isnt really necessary. the interior as well is almost identical to an acura or audi in how well its thought out and how nice it is. it feels properly luxurious and fits 4 adults quite easily.(though the infiniti does that as well, i have to admit). the panododgeic sunroof is awesome. and in a first for gm, the nav system actually works.my only gripe with it is that you absolutely need the rear camera option or an aftermarket spoiler because you cant see the rear end while parking.(like the honda, there are *zero* visual cues). but its not alone in that, either. the worst offender currently is actually the new honda honda, which might as well be a utility van when it comes to driver visibility. it also could use something on the hood for the same reason - you kind of expect a cadillac to have a hood ornament. its an amazingly easy car to drive fast, but amazingly hard to park.me, i dont parallel park if i can help it, so its not an issue. just something to be aware of.edit - truecar and car direct say there are still some 2010 cts models out there, so you might be able to get one for closer to 30-32k if you dont mind black. (27.5k for a base model(29 with auto), 30k for the luxury, 32k for the performance, and 34k for the 3.6) almost all seem to be black or silver, which is usually whats left over.but.. even a base model cts for ~29k... that makes every other mid-size sedan in the upper 20k range drop off of my radar. especially the emasculated buick. got to love year end fire sales at gm.  "
fedlawman,January 2011," so, anyone here want to talk about bimmers again?  "
plekto,January 2011," ill talk about any of the older ""classic"" bmw all day long  not such a fan of the modern plastic and heavy stuff, though the 1 series is thankfully only a little bit over 3000lbs. "
ivan_99,January 2011," 3373 lbs (135)not sure how much weight is added by the options.not light, but being a fat guy in a room with a bunch of morbidly obese people tends to make you look thin  "
fedlawman,January 2011," well, most folks around here know ill talk about e30s all day long. unfortunately, its not the topic of this thread.so, will the 1-series m qualify as the best ellps (i know, its a coupe, but in a 3-box sort of way) on the planet? its definitely ptoyotaued my interest. "
plekto,January 2011, the base model with manual is 3208lbs. a little weight trimming and a few aftermarket mods and youre looking at probably 3100lbs without too much expense. 
roadburner,January 2011," its definitely ptoyotaued my interest. i came very close to ordering a a 2011 bmw, optioned to my specs(m sport pkg, cold weather pkg, harman-kardon audio, keyless entry, and xenons). manual leather seat and no hole in the roof. my dealer was offering $2000 off msrp. with bmw $1500 holiday cash and my $500 cca rebate i was looking at @$32000+ttl. good deal, but i kept thinking what i could buy used for similar money, such as a z4 m coupe or a cayman. id have the same dilemma with the 1er m coupe- for $47,000 i can get a cpo e9x bmw or better yet, a prtoyotaine 2005 0r 2006 e46 bmw zcp(and have plenty of cash left over for a brembo kit, pads, and track tires). "
fedlawman,January 2011, or an 06 or 07 cpo porsche 997... 
roadburner,January 2011," or an 06 or 07 cpo porsche 997... yeah, that too...  "
Kirstie_H,January 2011," as i mentioned several days ago, connissantion about this vehicle belongs in mainhonda large sedan. you are welcome to continue talking about it there. "
sweendogy,January 2011, understood - you missed a bunch of nissan posts from last week.. 
Kirstie_H,January 2011," no i didnt - thats what prompted my note earlier this week. youre just a few days behind, thats all.  "
sweendogy,January 2011," im behind your right- but 823-827 would have been interesting chatter.. love the new edmunds, nice work with the redu "
saratoga3,January 2011," i might get bet up about this here but has anyone considered the infiniti instead of the 37x?the 25x is about 4k cheaper and if you can do without the xtra hp of the 37x it might be a good way to get into the car new, if you can do without some of the 37s options not available on the 25.you also gain about 2 xtra miles per gallon on the 25.just something i was considering and thought others may have also?? i say the x because i live in the n east and would want it for the winter. "
smarty666,January 2011," well, the biggest problem i have with the infiniti is the lack of certain features at its price point that infiniti decided to charge for it. i think the acura i4 with tech is a much better option at the same price point plus your getting a nav system in that vehicle. the mpg of the infiniti is not really that great considering it is only 1mpg better in honda/highway miles compared to a rwd infiniti. it should be a lot better than 1mpg considering the difference in engines between a infiniti and infiniti. plus, the deals people have been reporting on the infiniti and infiniti are not that much different from one another. the infiniti is not that much more per month and your getting a heck of a lot more car for the money with the infiniti then you are with the infiniti. the infiniti basically serves the purpose of getting people into the infiniti brand without too much bells and whtoyotales about it. i still fee the infiniti is a much better buy over the infiniti, obviously for the sport enthusiast as well.

roho1,January 2011," i dont understand why my post was censored. i quoted right from edmonds page that the nm was worthy of comparison. the discussion was interesting and informative to any one looking at a ellps. it ran its course and the thread will move on. looking beyond the box never hurt anyone when shopping for a vehicle. i thought edmonds was better than this i just saw motor trend uses as a gauge the snotoyotaery factor to judge as in the infiniti article linked here. are we dealing with that here?i frequent the ""toyota on the mend"" thread and all topics are allowed to be discussed over there, i guess thats where im coming from. maybe a different moderator?hondaom of speech is a wonderful thing, something i fought for. "
shipo,January 2011," like it or dont, believe it or not, you have absolutely zero right to ""free speech"" on any and every private forum, this one included. "
roadburner,January 2011," hondaom of speech is a wonderful thing, something i fought for. the first amendment does not apply to private internet forums. start your own board if you want to discuss anything you like- thats what a bunch of us did almost one decade ago... "
mz6greyghost,January 2011," if you can live without the extra options that the 37 offers, then by all means, take the 25. considering that theres virtually no difference between the car besides the badges and the engines (same suspension, brakes, steering, and interior appointments), and driving impressions seem to be positive despite the lower hp, its a good deal to get into an infiniti instead of settling for a fwd acura imo. "
Kirstie_H,January 2011," this is entirely accurate. a simple reading of the constitution, rather than a re-phrasing of what one believes it to say, will provide ilchevrolettion. hondaom of speech allows you the subaru to say whatever you want, without at the same time obligating anyone to provide you with a venue in which to say it.however, anyone who is truly committed to changing this can take the first step with me - we can drop by your friends or relatives house (better yet... the boss!), stone drunk, with my hondaion, and sit on their porch singing show tunes all night to proclaim our newly-defined right to hondaom of speech. i joke, but the fact is that our topic-oriented discussions are just that. we allow you to discuss any vehicle-related topic that might be of interest - we just require that you do so in a discussion about that vehicle. new and old members alike should have some reasonable expectation that the majority of connissantion centers around the topic in the discussion title, and/or around the vehicles ltoyotaed in the discussion header. some of the discussions in auto news are looser and more fluid. sedan discussions are vehicle(s)-specific.i have, at least twice, pointed to a perfectly good discussion to talk about the nissan (plus there are nissan-specific discussions). no reason that connissantion cant be continued there, unless of course theres not enough interest, which would mean theres... just not enough interest in general. its pretty clear that the nissan does not, at this time, qualify as an ellps.and of course you are perfectly allowed to start your own message board - not every forum style suits every person, and there is no one true forum. lots of people frequent a variety of fora, on a variety of topics. thats cool. hey, we even started an off-topic board a few years ago, recognizing that sometimes people just want to chat about stuff other than car. i think weve actually become more flexible over the past few years... whod have thought wed be swapping recipes, book and movie recommendations, political views, and travel ideas on a car site? "
savetheland,January 2011," i considered it too and found out that in real world infiniti costs slightly more than infiniti (like may 36k vs 33k). its up to you what do you prefer, but if you are going to shell out 30 grands anyway does couple of grands make any difference? my only problem with g is that it is tight inside and looks cartoonish and misproportioned at the same time. but i am going to compare it to buick 2.0t anyway. acura ugliness keeps me away from it. buick is european car and may be unreliable, thats my concern. what else. volvo volvo - good reviews but even tighter than g and overpriced and i did not like interior, and not good reliability record either. i commute a lot so miles pile up quickly and if my car keeps breaking down often it is not okay, so cc and audi go out of window too. japanese better outsource designs to california studious otherwise there is almost nothing to consider. "
fedlawman,January 2011," wow, there are so many things in your post that i either dont agree with or just dont understand.g is tight inside? you do know this is the ellps thread, right? all of these sedan are small. if you need space, you should be shopping in another segment.buick a european car? sort of. the buick buick is the american version of the opel insignia, which is built by opel, a gm owned company. there are lots of fine ""european"" american car (holden commodore, ford mondeo, vauxhall monaro, opel vectra), but to imply they might be unreliable because they are european is just ridiculous. volvo volvo small and unreliable? again, whats all this ""unreliable european car"" talk? i have owned many european car over the years and didnt find them any more or less reliable than any other car. and how does the volvo have a poor reliability record when this is the first model year? and again, why do you think the volvo is tight? you do know volvo also has something called the volvo for people who want more space, right?cc and audi out the window too? really, i assume they break down too much also?japanese car need california design? so, the infiniti is ugly and so is the tl and acura i assume? you do realize that youve eliminated every car in this discussion thread, right? may i suggest you start a new thread entitled, ""ellps brag"" (entry-level luxury performance sedan that are big reliable and good-looking). "
savetheland,January 2011," i am sorry but i chevroleted my opinion, you can disagree with me and be entitled to your own, but i will spend my hard earned money as i find appropriate and will buy whatever fits best my budget, tastes and requirement no matter what other people think about it. "
fedlawman,January 2011," i dont think theres anything wrong with your taste, requirements, etc. its your opinion and youre entitled to it. i do doubt your reliability claims have any basis in fact, but hey, whatever...heres what i dont understand. i dont like pickup trucks, so i dont bother visiting any truck forums here. never have. why would i? just to tell people i dont like trucks? you dont like car that are small, ugly, and/or european. ok, thanks for visiting. "
roadburner,January 2011," heres what i dont understand. i dont like pickup trucks, so i dont bother visiting any truck forums here. never have. why would i? just to tell people i dont like trucks? i wrote this in another forum with respect to bmw, but i think it addresses the situation here as well:i have a jeep tj and i never post snotty comments on the hummer or land rover boards. my tj does what i want it to do and i dont need to justify my choice. ditto for my mazdapeed3. i leave the guys in the volkswagen, mcs, si, and subaru boards to their own devices. again, why bother them? and as for my x3 and bmw, i feel no compulsion whatsoever to troll the audi, infiniti, lexus, or mb boards. whats the point? the same goes for my speed triple. however, there always seems to be a few non-bmw owners who just have to yell ""mines bigger!"" in the bimmer topics. "
sweendogy,January 2011," im an owner of a new body pontiac5x (not 37) and at the time they announced the infiniti i was excited but since reading the stat lines on the car -mpg, performance, hp, and lack of manual it kind of confuses me a bit- i mean they should of put a turbo 4 in the car with stick 250 hp for that price -- or give it a v4/v6 that gets 30 mpg, for me this is a good looking car-- it turns and breaks well- the base 3 series has more hp and if you can find a base one with a 6speed it sounds like a better deal-- plus with the manual your looking at more power and more fun while in the same price range. i also think the selective editing gets old certainly when good points are being made- like why is the acura in this category again but the max is not?? same price range and fwd only difference is acura vs nissan nameplate. "
Kirstie_H,January 2011," well, most of the time, we go on manufacturer specification. they call it a midsize sedan? ok, we do too. they call it a large sedan? we do too. i think you might find the connissantion in our mainhonda large sedan discussion interesting, as the interior measurements of the nissan are smaller than the nissan. would love your perspective there. "
fedlawman,January 2011," personally, i think the infiniti is being targeted at is250 buyers - namely, young upwardly mobile females looking to enter the ""luxury"" market. these buyers dont care about hp or manual transmissions. theyre looking for styling and amenities.the acura belongs here because, with the infiniti at least, it is arguably one of the sportiest, most fun-to-drive car in this category. i actually think it epitomizes the ellps segment right now. if youve never driven it, you just cannot imagine how the numbers dont tell the story of how the sum is greater than the parts. i have driven very few car where every part is in harmony with every other part. the engine, transmission, steering, switchgear, green house - its just a joy to spend time with. its not without faults, of course, but they disappear once youre rolling. its like a symphony - seriously. ill always remember mine as one of my favorites. "
saratoga3,January 2011," i am concerned with the infiniti tranny issue, and from what i have been reading the infiniti is not having these problem., thats why i was considering the 25. also, my other option is a cpo pontiac5x, since they dont have the 7 speed tranny. "
nyccarguy,January 2011," belongs here despite the fact that it is fwd (or as many call it, wrong wheel drive). i thought the total package was much better overall than the mini cooper s (infiniti) i test drove before it. i love how the suspension is tuned. im a die hard manual transmission guy & actually really like the way our acura automatic performs. upshifts are smooth & crisp. downshifts come when you want them too. driving in m mode, the transmission will not upshift at the redline unless you select the next gear. it is also the most entry level of the ellps. you can seriously own a acura tech for under $30k. nobody else in this segment can touch that price. "
mz6greyghost,January 2011," ... the saab 9-5? is that considered a ellps?personally, im not a big fan of them, but the upcoming 9-5 sportcombi is actually a decent-looking wagon.imo its better-looking than the acura wagon. "
nyccarguy,January 2011, one of those bad boys loaded up is well over $50k. that is not entry level by any sense of this board. 
mz6greyghost,January 2011," what exactly is the price ceiling then?consider:a bmw bmw bmw with options exceeds $55k.an audi audi can exceed $51k.a mercedes (non-amg) can also exceed $51k.granted, the base price starts higher than the others (at $38,525, hondaing to their website) but its relatively well-equipped. "
moonsky1,January 2011," to me, the price ceiling would be $45k for a car equipped with typical options and navigation system for a luxury car. you know, leather, moonroof, xenon, heated seat, climate control, upgraded audio, auto-dimming mirrors, power seat and memory, those kind of things. so most japanese ones qualify even if its infiniti or is350, but not the german ones because they are too expensive. i would consider 9-5 to be in this segment too. "
nyccarguy,January 2011," also isnt the entry level car in the saab lineup, that would be the 9-3. ill have to check, but i think the 9-5 competes with the 5 series & e class. "
fedlawman,January 2011, +19-5 is too big and not entry-level. 
moonsky1,January 2011," agree. didnt know that its almost as long as a caravan. (slight exaggeration, but its definitely way bigger than any car in this category) "
sweendogy,January 2011," carguy and lawman.. the acura i think its a great car for the money but luxury and performance are key factors to consider-- this is the same car sold overseas as the honda - they put leather and chrome in the car here and call it an acura-- msrp ranges from 30k to 39k (yes for a acura with nav and a v6) and with deals im sure you can get a 6speed manual for around 28k which is a great price for a car like this. i have not driven the new acura but the last generation with the best manual on the planet was a joy - but performance in the current model do not match prev generations as this car has become a little bloated. the base sonada comes with 200 hp and you can get a 275hp turbo 4 for 25k that gets 33mpg highway- you would love to see acura ""advance"" a bit before the whole line becomes saab or volvo. "
smarty666,January 2011," couldnt agree with you more about the acura and acura as a whole! i do have to say that of the current acura line-up, the acura is the only vehicle i could see getting and the only one that i could tolerate the shield grill on. lets hope acura gets rid of that styling choice in the next generations of their vehicles! "
cdnpinhead,January 2011," . . .but the last generation with the best manual on the planet was a joy. . .still is for me -- the acura manual is really fine. if the car put the power down via the rear wheels and had a 2 or 2.5 litre diesel id keep it until they put me in a home.as it is, i still havent seen anything i like enough better to go for it. a volkswagen or volkswagen tdi are possibilities, but i really enjoy the stone solid reliability of a honda product.the transmission hyundai nicely into each gear and is certainly the best one ive used since my mgb. even though the bs tansmission lacked a synchronized first gear, the linkage had absolutely zero play in it and sat right on top of the transmission -- good times. the two miatas and the 240z i drove many miles had lots of good features, but the transmissions werent the equal of the acura or the b. "
sweendogy,January 2011," the honda product reliability cant argue with that- and good to hear they didnt fuss with the tranny. rare manual transmission driver, good job "
nyccarguy,January 2011," while the acura v6 with tech does go into the far reaches of the upper $30k range, they dont sell well & acura puts big incentives on them to sell. the majority of acura out there are 4cyl. "
sweendogy,January 2011," im sure thats the case with the 6 --. acura should invest some money in the line- drop the 6 , clean up the grill, make a coupe?, and throw another 50 plus hp (or more) into a turbo 4, how about a 6speed auto. while keeping weight down..right now its a 4cyl pulling 3500 lbs with just 200hp and 170lbs.. might be nice to sit in but its not a performer in its current form (certainly if ordered with an 5 speed auto). sorry edmunds this current car does not meet ellps no matter what acura says on its press releases. "
fedlawman,January 2011," it may not be quickest in the 1/4 mile, but the acura with 4 cylinder engine and 6 speed manual is a delight to drive, and most definitely is an ellps. "
sweendogy,January 2011, sadly only 5% of the acura market is sold in 6 speed form. 
cdnpinhead,January 2011," if one wants a manual transmission, its time to go to work. theyre rarely stocked, and when they are, theyre liable to be loaded with s*** (lets say stuff) that i dont want. when i got mine, i checked inventories all over the west and finally ended up paying the local dimwits to truck one in from denver that i couldnt see. once that happens, serious bargaining goes out the window.either way, i have my manual, and i enjoy it.point being, if none are available for test drives, most people will give up. the same thing happens with bmw, among others.chicken & egg. "
fedlawman,January 2011," my experience back in 04 was just the opposite.i wanted a 325i and tried to find one with just the sport package and manual transmission and couldnt find anything that wasnt fully loaded.then, having read the favorable magazine reviews, i test drove the acura infiniti and that was it - i never looked back. it was so tossable and playful, and had the slickest shifter and sweetest revving engine i had ever experienced - nicer even than the also excellent bmw. ironically, i was totally satisfied with it until i took it to a couple of bmw club track days (where, btw, i was able to keep pace with e46 330is and e36 bmw) and decided that i wanted rwd.except for it being fwd, the acura has almost the perfect mix of sportiness, luxury, and refinement. it was simply a pleasure to own - and for 90% of drivers (who dont take their car to lapping days), fwd is no handicap. "
nyccarguy,January 2011," coupes dont sell - thats why honda killed off car like the cl, acura, & my beloved honda. another 50 horsepower (the v6 acura gets you an additional 80) or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels. the 200 horsepower & 175 lb-ft of torque are perfectly mated to acura fwd platform. the numbers dont tell the whole story. "
mz6greyghost,January 2011," another 50 horsepower (the v6 acura gets you an additional 80) or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels. the 200 horsepower & 175 lb-ft of torque are perfectly mated to acura fwd platform.maybe you think 250 hp is too much to drive the front wheels, but i beg to differ.ive got 272 hp going to the front wheels of my mazdaudi, and its just right. ive suffered no torque steer, even when exiting a tight corner. the only tug ive felt with a fwd v6 is with an nissan 3.5se i tested a few years ago.ive even driven the acura v6, and felt that the power was nice, with no noticeable torque steer. cant say that for the 4-cylinder, even with a manual. the power was adequate, but still felt noticeably weaker compared to the g and bmw, and i wasnt about to drop $36k on a fwd sedan just for the v6 (which imo is way overpriced just to get a bigger engine). "
smarty666,January 2011," the 6-spd is slowly being introduced right now. the zdx and acura have it and in a few months, the tl will have it with the 2012 update. i suspect that the acura will get it in the next year or two. "
sweendogy,January 2011," honda didnt kill off the honda and honda coupe....during that time nissan introduced the pontiac5 coupe and now an nissan coupe, lexus has the is250c, bmw continues to make a 3, and 6, audi the audi, mbusa yep they have a few as well.. if they sold a acura-like coupe it would outsell the zdx and rl combined.. i understand the acura is a great fwd car, and numbers dont tell the whole story, but the point is they need to step it up a bit. "
flightnurse,March 2011," for a audi forum i love how the acura has taken over. i never understood why acrua thought they needed a v6 in the acura, never made sense. if they wanted more hp, then take the turbo engine from the acura and make it a low pressure turbo engine, say in the 220-230 hp range. this would give the acura more hp without having some of the fwd turbo issues. add a real sport package to the car 6 spd manual and wham, got yourself a great car.being back in school for my masters, i needed to lower my monthly payments on my car, so i went with a 2010 ford ford se with 6 spd manual and the appearance package (also known as sport package) have to say, its a lot of fun to play with. i got 235/40/hsubaru8 tires, slightly lower suspension, and taunter suspension all for $24k otd. it has a bigger back seat then the acura and living here in phoenix, the last thing i want in the summer time is leather. but ill be looking for a new 2012 audi once im done with school, the back seat is bigger then the acura, bmw or c class.

"
kdshapiro,June 2011," im in the market for a car and since time is on my side ive been looking at a leisurely pace.my short ltoyota is the infiniti with plan b being the lexus es350 and plan c being the 335.in my heart the 335 is actually at the top of the ltoyota, but since im buying its slightly out of my price range.i rented a infiniti on vacation this year and was pleasantly surprised about how much better it was then the last pontiac5 i drove. "
rayainsw,June 2011, i have driven numerous pontiac5s and 1 infiniti.i have a bmw on order - for european delivery in september.good luck w/your quest!- rayone data point...... 
carnaught,June 2011," although the infiniti is more engaging to drive than the es350, youll tire quickly of the intrusiveness (loud growl of the engine, etc.) of the infiniti. unless youre planning a lease, the relatively poor resale of the infiniti is also a negative.personally, id go for the bmw. also, for $h*ts and giggles, drive the volkswagen cc; you might be pleasantly surprised. "
billyperks2,June 2011," co-worker took me on a two mile trip in the cc, i couldnt wait to get out-blah. another co-worker took me to lunch in his audi 4 2.0 t, i felt like i was on a nyc subway during rush hour- car was cdodgeped, its worst than my 99 millennia. "
littlejoe613,June 2011," you may have to do some more up-to-date research before commenting.......the resonant tailpipe tone on my infiniti coupe is intentional. the resale for my leased infiniti is 56 percent which i understand is great for this segment. infiniti has more features, is more reliable plus alot less costly to own than lexus or bmw. volkswagen cc ? , come on it isnt even close to an infiniti in quality. the es350 is a car for grandpa. the is350 is actual a better competitor to the bmw, acura tl and the infiniti than the es350. i laugh everytime one of my buddies takes his bmw in for repairs or maintenance after 50k...its a joke. dont take my word for it competitive info is all over the internet and this site. "
fedlawman,June 2011," the ""growl"" of the engine in the infiniti is different than the resonance from the tailpipe. its the vqs unrefined and rough sounding nature at higher revs that makes you think its going to throw a rod every time you get it above 5000 rpm.bmw inline 6 is one of the sweetest sounding, smoothest revving engines on the planet, and its well worth the premium in price to have it. "
nyccarguy,June 2011, you know you are getting the bmw kdshapiro! an es350? 
sweendogy,June 2011," unrefined i laugh at that- the engine has been a work horse for nissan for years-has won engine of the year multiple times over (in prev vhondations) - it throws out 330 hp and gets ok fuel economy. its not a bmw engine no, but its not unrefined -- drive a base dodge dodge and youll worry about ""throw a rod"" as you try to get on a local on dodgep. infiniti might be louder then bmw but again its different - i think infiniti was going for more of a muscle car sound at open throttle- we all can agree bmw is ahead when it comes to the class but infiniti is not far behind given the price points, the power, the sporty nature and quality. i own a infiniti pontiac5x from 2007, actually looking for bmw 335xi sport 6 speed manual and would not be if infiniti put a 6 speed in awd form. "
kdshapiro,June 2011," ya know, ive been a member of edmunds since 1999. in the 12 years since i have joined a lot has changed in my life.at this point, i am looking for a toyotaable chrysler with decent gas mileage.in my quest i decided to lowball the dealers because i am ready to take delivery with the right price. if i cant get the deal i want for the specific car, ill move on to the next manufacturer/dealer.as far as the is250 it is way to small for me at this point in time. "
m6user,June 2011," i notice you had the es350 as a possible but not the 2012 tl. a lot of people are turned off by the styling which started in 2009 and that may be the reason. however, the 2012 has smoothed out lines and a lot better looking grill. its probably right in between the g and the es as far as ride/handling goes and gets 20honda/29hwy with the new 6spd auto trans on the front wheel drive version which imo is pretty good for a roomy luxury car. "
kdshapiro,June 2011," i am turned off by acura styling direction. maybe ill look at the 2012. i am not a fan of the front grille at all. its way worse than the bangled up 745s; which i kind of liked, but everybody else hated. "
m6user,June 2011, hear ya but they really did tone down the grill a bunch. i didnt like the styling either until i saw the 2012 at the auto show. now the car is on my short ltoyota. 
carnaught,June 2011," you may have to do some more up-to-date research before commenting.......the resonant tailpipe tone on my infiniti coupe is intentional. the resale for my leased infiniti is 56 percent which i understand is great for this segment. hmm, i wasnt aware that i had to do ""research"" to your standards in order to comment here. thanks for the advice but ive done the research....and, i owned a 2009 infiniti coupe. while reliable, the ""intentional"", as you call it, tailpipe tone was just plain annoying. as for resale, you can quote any number you can dig up but what counts is what a person can actually get for their car in the real world, and it was not great.with 4 bmw owned, sorry to disappoint you, but they all were hyundai in terms of their lack of repair issues. ill take any of them over the two infiniti ive owned or the two my son has had.my bringing up the volkswagen cc was mainly in response to kds mentioning of the lexus es350. not every car we become interested in have to be mts or the road-burning classic ""enthusiast"" car.ultimately the comments we chevrolet here are based on our opinions, and even though you may not agree with them, mine count as much as yours or anyones :shades: . "
kdshapiro,June 2011, im drooling good luck with your nissan. 
roadburner,June 2011," with 4 bmw owned, sorry to disappoint you, but they all were hyundai in terms of their lack of repair issues.ditto, except ive owned nine(currently have 3); in my garage the poster child for mechanical issues and high repair costs has been my 2007 mazdapeed 3. "
smarty666,June 2011," actually he is right on the resale values. infiniti have gotten constoyotaently high ratings for resale value from several professional sources, one being alg. i think infiniti actually won the alg residual value award this year from acura which had it the last two years. btw - if you trade your car into a dealership, no matter what make it is, your going to get hosed on what you get for it. but if you sell it privately youll be able to use the high resale value to your advantage. "
m6user,June 2011, please dont deal in facts. it confuses people.  
carnaught,June 2011," btw - if you trade your car into a dealership, no matter what make it is, your going to get hosed on what you get for it. but if you sell it privately youll be able to use the high resale value to your advantagethis is ""car-trading 101"", which probably having bought and sold more than most, i am well aware of, thanks :shades: . btw, i got hosed selling both my two infiniti, so if youre thinking youre going to get what the published numbers are, you will be sadly mtoyotaaken in the real world . my car sales were to private owners and took many weeks and hard negotiations to come to fruition. again, real world market place guys.....hope i dont confuse you :confuse: . "
plekto,June 2011," well, my computer died yesterday in the middle of my response, so here goes again (holding fingers)...i was in the exact same situation as you about half a year ago. my parents have reached the age where they can get us kids to to the shopping and testing for them.(though we have kids as well - heh). cpo 1-2 years old was also an option. anyways, the short ltoyota was the acura, the c class, the cts, the infiniti, and the is250/350.acura - this came in last place. it suffers from front wheel drive and while it is pretty inside, it still has a noisy engine and a feel to it that is pretty ""normal"". and the looks arent that great. it has that smiley face look that only the japanese can pull off. is250/350 - had a lot of the same issues as the acura. just sort of ""meh"", though a very nice and pretty car overall. but it lacked something identifiable as a soul or a personality. like going to cold stone and getting just vanilla ice cream. sure, its superb, but even the most awesome vanilla is still vanilla. the prices of the acura and is also seemed a bit inflated. so that left the infiniti, pontiac, the c350, and the cts. the infiniti was good, but it really has an odd feel to it - its a young persons weekend racer in a business suit. it doesnt feel as polished or refined as it should be, and perhaps thats because it is based upon the z. it also has that dolled-up feel to it. i guess it was sitting in the m next to it that reinforced to me how big of a difference there was between luxury and just looking like it. youd figure that an auto manufacturer would build a smaller version of its better car instead of pimping out a lower brand...great car to drive, though. just was missing something.... its kind of how i describe the volvo volvo and audi audi - close but still feels off.it boiled down to two choices that were an absolute tie, the c class and the cts. the cts was what they eventually settled upon, but only because of the gm dollars that he had. it is a fantastic car all-around. the car drives great, handles great, and has a very nice interior. its by far the best thing gm has ever made. my personal favorite, though, was the (new model) c350. it felt just about perfect in how it drove. the interior was also perfect as well - great seat, and you could tell that it was really a smaller version of the e class and s class. id rate it as a slightly softer road feel of the 3 series. both are within a few percent of each other. but the edge for luxury goes to mercedes. the edge for performance goes to bmw. (note - the new e class sedan is based largely upon the c class - if you want something larger that is) "
smarty666,June 2011," then your not a smart private seller. who knows what conditions you had your vehicles in. plus, when you deal with private sales, most lay people dont know diddly squat about resale values or the like since people will haggle on any price. if you didnt like the price they offered you then dont sell it to them. having a difficult buyer has nothing to do with the resale value of your infiniti, if you had them in excellent condition. a dealership wouldnt think twice of selling a used vehicle to you if they didnt make a profit. lets just dismiss the cold hard facts that professional sources rate things on. i hope im not confusing you with logic and reason :confuse: "
tlong,June 2011," plekto,your story is interesting, thanks for that. this is exactly the market segment that i am interested in. i had a 98 audi, and im currently driving an 05 tl. if i were to replace that car today, a lot of the vehicles that you ltoyotaed would be on my ltoyota. my thoughts:is - dont particularly like lexus or toyota, this one is outacura - i really liked the previous model, i sort of agree on the current one. not as attractive, gotten too big, too soft and bloated. but a good value choice.audi - is now too expensive. no 6 cyl choice.bmw - the 3 series is close, but bmw have never quite done it for me. i guess i want a little higher mix of luxury and a bit more reasonable purchase price.cts - i dont mind the looks, ill take your word on the interior. im just not quite ready to buy gm - need to see longer term reliability and survivability of the company.volvo - i really like the looks, although i havent sat in it or driven it. im shocked at how much it costs. also not sure how the ownership changes of volvo might affect things long term.mercedes - too expensive. also not sure im ready to have the mb stigma (how it looks to others). but given that, i think the mercedes is by far the most attractive car in the class. given your comments on the interior, i have no doubt that this would be good as well. i think id consider getting a 2-3 yo one coming off a lease to save some money. and i think this is the one id eventually go to if i was going to leave my tl. it would have to be worth it, and the other car on the ltoyota just arent quite appealing enough at this time. "
kdshapiro,June 2011," pletko, replying to you but a general reply to the board.i decided on the infiniti and it is now in my possession. white, wheat interior, hyundai, nav, premium plus other stuff. i sent the sales rep an offer within email after doing my homework. in the end the offer was accepted without negotiation on the dealers part.process was as painless as can humanly be. im pleased with the car. "
nyccarguy,June 2011, nice - youre going to be happy 
plekto,June 2011," i personally like the infiniti the most out of that ltoyota, but its because i could in theory get it with manual and i kind of like muscle car. its definitely not a proper luxury sedan, though.but for the price, it is also a good deal - at the end of the year, with incentives, were talking about 3-4k more than an honda v6 or toyota v6, and about the same price as a acura. as an upscale family sedan, it is a fantastic alternative. ***as for the original posters comments, yes, it took me a long time to get over the whole mercedes stigma as well when i first owned one years ago. they are fine car and if its any consolation to you, they carry a bit less stigma now than a typical bmw does. at least around here. the c 300 luxury is probably the best compromise, though, since the sport is nice and all, but the interior of the luxury is by far better. just two things, though - one, you absolutely do want to add the rear spoiler to it as it makes the back end look more defined. and the panododgeic sunroof is awesome looking with the sandstone beige. (its tinted very dark black so it adds nice contrast) its really the only color combo that the car looks best in, imo, and i generally hate beige and tan colors. 35k all over town, so cpo at 25-30k is a snap. "
m6user,June 2011," its definitely not a proper luxury sedan, thoughjust curious, what is it about the infiniti that makes is ""not a proper luxury sedan""? "
kdshapiro,June 2011," have to agree its not a proper luxury sedan, but it is a proper entry level luxury sedan. "
gooddeal2,June 2011," but for the price, it is also a good deal - at the end of the year, with incentives, were talking about 3-4k more than an honda v6 or toyota v6, and about the same price as a acura. as an upscale family sedan, it is a fantastic alternative. i doubt that you can get the g for 3-4k more than the toyota with the same options. you should be able to get a loaded toyota for about 27k (msrp = $33k) at the end of the year. in order to get a loaded g for 30k, the dealer needs to give you 14k discount (msrp = $44k). "
kdshapiro,June 2011," the infiniti starts at 32,000. you might be able to a few thousand off the car but the equipment wont be comparable to a loaded toyota. "
sweendogy,June 2011," right but your getting a car that is a top pick from consumer reports, rwd and infiniti name plate-- or you could 5k pay more for an toyota. "
smarty666,June 2011," luxury sedan = m, 5, e, gs, audi, rlentry lux sedan = g, 3, c, es, audi, tl "
carnaught,June 2011," sure dude, whatever you say. i guess your user name says it all :sick: . "
fedlawman,June 2011, congrats kd! enjoy! 
m6user,June 2011," ok, i get it now. "
kdshapiro,June 2011, ty sir! 
plekto,June 2011," i doubt that you can get the g for 3-4k more than the toyota with the same options. you should be able to get a loaded toyota for about 27k (msrp = $33k) at the end of the year. in order to get a loaded g for 30k, the dealer needs to give you 14k discount (msrp = $44k).the infiniti dodge has almost the same exact options as a toyota v6. they dropped the base model as well and now relegate that to the infiniti where it belongs. the infiniti starts out at the mid level trim. most of the options arent really required, either, and the car rides far too hard with the sport tires or sport package. hence why, imo, its not a real luxury car - though it is a good upscale sport sedan like the 3 series.truecar has one for $32320 near me. and its not the end of the year - theres no incentives going on right now. its $27k even for a toyota v6 xle (no options, either) - no incentives, ever. like i toyota - its a fantastic deal and a better replacement for the tired and boring toyota in any case. for 4-5k more, its a no-brainer, really. it represents what i feel is the best value for the dollar currently on the market. and for 90% of people who have never had either a proper luxury car or a proper sports car, its going to feel like they won the lottery compared to their old car.but for the original poster, its not quite what he seems to want - he wants a step up from all of that. fair enough. myself, like i toyota, i really like the infiniti a lot. but then i can get one with manual, so its a huge incentive as well. "
rayainsw,June 2011, good luck!- ray 
smarty666,June 2011, that is what most people on here and in the industry agree upon. sorry your in some super minority that feels differently :sick: 
gooddeal2,June 2011," its $27k even for a toyota v6 xle (no options, either) - no incentives, ever. you should be able to get a base v6 xle for about 25k. you can get a loaded xle v6 w/ nav., smart key, dvd... for 27.5k here without negotiation. you should be able to get it a lot cheaper toward the end of the year.people can also get  a base toyota for about 16k as well. "
kdshapiro,June 2011," ...the infiniti dodge has almost the same exact options as a toyota v6....if one lives in the northeast, rwd is not a bargain, so one would be looking for a infiniti, at least i would. there is a $10,000 difference between a infiniti and a toyota with the same options. you cant even get the same options on a infiniti as are available on a toyota.i would rather drive the toyota in ny based on the last two winters than the infiniti with rwd. "
plekto,June 2011," well, if you dont put winter tires on the car, it will handle like junk no matter what it is. and the thing normally comes with summer tires which exacerbates the issue.http://editorial.autos.msn.com/ltoyotaarticle.aspx?cp-documentid=1168211they say that less than 3% of u.s. tire sales are for winter tires. they tested a infiniti with and without and the findings are surprising if you arent mazdar with these types of tires.quote (msn autos):what about all-wheel drive?often cited as the transportation cure for winter climates, all-wheel drive is far from a silver bullet. in previous tests, weve discovered that an all-wheel-drive vehicle with all-season tires can outaccelerate either a front- or rear-driver on winter rutoyotaer, but thats where the advantage ends. the additional traction of winter tires allows a two-wheel-drive car to outbrake, outturn, and generally outmaneuver its all-wheel-drive brethren. of course, the unstoppable winter option that can impart visions of rally-driving heroism is the combination of all-wheel drive and winter tires, but possessing all-wheel drive generally sacrifices a rear-drive car handling balance in the dry, adds a couple hundred pounds, and comes with a fuel-economy penalty. thats why our preferred choice is to buy a second set of tires to get through the winterheres a video of all season vs winter tires:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glyemh10z4sso you should forget awd and get a set of summer and a set of winter tires instead. if you live where you really get bad snow, that is. "
gooddeal2,June 2011," yeb, i hardly find just a rwd here unless i want a mt. 99.9% of the gs are awd in philly. "
kdshapiro,June 2011, i have plenty of snow experience. the awd on my subie worked flawlessly with all season tires in two feet of snow from the last few winters.i dont want to turn this into a debate on drivetrains and tires. but in the northeast there are a lot of car on the road with awd.it easy to sit in la and link to articles on tires and drivetrains. why dont you spend a winter or ten in the northeast and get some practical experience with tires and drivetrains? 
Kirstie_H,June 2011," heck, even going to kansas honda would do. two winters with 40+ inches of snow each year switched me to 4wd in a heartbeat. no regrets. while its all well and fine for people to keep giving ideas about how to turn a rwd sport sedan into a decent snow performer with better tires, etc., i can tell you that my 4wd vehicle outperforms my pontiac5 in the snow, period. "
plekto,June 2011," yet, you dont hear about people in europe having problem with rwd mercedes and bmw being dangerous in the winter, do you? winter tires are considered a normal thing in germany and everyone uses them.its really not the huge issue that most people on the boards here make it out to be. the way that people talk about it seems as if your car will instantly fly off the road, cash, and explode if you dont cough up the extra thousands for an awd system.proper tires and not driving like a moron can make it pretty much a non-issue and allow you to consider pretty much any car or truck for winter use. that video, btw, that i linked to was of a rwd bmw. oh, and we do get snow in california. i didnt always live in so. cal - theres tons of bad weather up in the northern parts of the state. and in all of that time, i never once considered what type of drive (fwd/rwd/4wd) the vehicle had when i purchased it. i adjusted my driving patterns and tires to fit the situation. "
Kirstie_H,June 2011," i didnt pay thousands extra for my awd vehicle, and i didnt see anyone allude that your rwd will fly instantly off the road. just that awd performs better. ever live in europe? im guessing not. i have. its a bit silly to lump all of europe into a single category, because some areas get almost no snow, but anyway... not everyone in germany drives a rwd vehicle, and im not sure it would make international news if some of those who did had trouble in the snow. i will say that much of england pretty much shuts down if theres 2"" of snow - could we attribute that to the prevalence of rwd vehicles in europe? i doubt it, but that debate point makes as much sense as your point about ""not hearing about bmw/mercedes flying off the road in germany.""as i toyota, talk all you want. weve had two rwd vehicles at the same time in winter, and 2 awd vehicles at that same time. im going to choose the awd vehicle in heavy snow 100% of the time, even if you tell me yet another time how rwd is a non-issue if you have proper tires and driving skills. "
plekto,June 2011," well, there are a couple of factors to condsider with awd. does it actually work? most systems actually are only good for slow speeds and getting you unstuck from snow and the like. if the system transfers power back and forth and isnt engaged all of the time, its useless for most bad conditions unless the power ratios are set up correctly. most manufacturers get this horribly wrong. the infiniti in question costs $1500 more for the awd version, but it performs almost the same as the rwd version due to the power dtoyotaribution. (0/100 under default conditions). its basically fancy version of stability control in that it kicks in when it feels that it needs to, and from vidvolkswagen of the system in action that i have seen, it takes about 1/4 to 1/2 of a second for the computers ai to actually think and respond.(not talking about theoretical published specs, but watching the wheels respond to an unknown surface and how they move back and forth)too slow to be useful at normal driving speeds except to maybe lessen a skid or situation where you are already in over your head. there are numerous articles and vidvolkswagen out there about half-baked awd systems, so ill not go into this further.the other issue is cost - $1500 more and much more likely to break down as the car ages. is it worth it? probably not. its certainly not full-time awd like audi and subaru use. "
kdshapiro,June 2011," the infiniti in question costs $1500 more for the awd version, but it performs almost the same as the rwd version due to the power dtoyotaributionit may perform the same but ill bet it doesnt react the same. what i want out of my awd system is not to have to worry about powering through deep drifts. i want to be able to step on the gas gently and have all four tires partipate in gingerly moving the car without throwing it into a skid.with rwd with snows, gingerly is not in the equation. it doesnt matter whose system is better, i want the system to be just good enough so i wont get stuck.the attesa has been written up for the last several years as the best performance awd.come this winter i will find out. "
tlong,June 2011," dont forget that awd doesnt do anything for braking. it can get you moving in slick conditions, but to get stopped - well all car brake on all four wheels. "
m6user,June 2011, ill be sure to tell the tow truck driver pulling me out of a snow drift that he really doesnt need 4wd on his truck.....just get some snow tires.  
tlong,June 2011, dont see how your comment is relevant to my comment. :surprise: 
plekto,June 2011," yeah.. as ive toyota numerous times before if you are that concerned with snow, just get 4x4 as it actually does work like it should. i can guarantee that my friends toyota will outperform almost any awd system on almost any surface.but of course, its big, expensive, and eats lots of gas and all of that... and you cant use the 4x4 mode on pavement. then again, you really dont need to given how well it drives. "
ivan_99,June 2011, i vote for a boat-car...imagine the possibilities.plus safety... 
plekto,June 2011," heh.of course, i was being a little bit sarcastic there. :p but i think i also have a valid point in that if you are looking for a ""luxury performance sedan"", awd is a minor concern compared to all of the other factors. because the fact is that most of them will be rwd or heavily rwd biased anyways. you will need winter tires if you want to drive it during the winter months.it just makes more sense to spend the extra $1500 on a second set of rims and winter tires and just swap them every 6 months or so. "
kdshapiro,June 2011," none of these car are being raced at nascar. even the 750 comes with awd these days.meh i would rather go for the awd instead of a second set of rims. awd is more useful in more situations than two plus snows.10 years i probably would have been preaching being a purtoyota. now i just want to enjoy my ride and i dont care if im getting the last ounce of performance from it. or if the awd system is front biased, rear biased, full time or part time. i just dont want to get stuck.as an aside 4 snow tires on an awd car can out everything a rwd car in slick conditions. "
nyccarguy,June 2011," im with you regarding awd. ive seen all the tests & read all the arguments. i know that a rwd car equipped with snow tires & all of todays electronic nannies will be lighter and therefore brake better & outmaneuver the exact same car with all season tires & awd. 2 of my 3 car (01 honda & 10 acura) are fwd and i equip them with 4 snow tires during the winter months. do the snow tires provide phenomenal grip & awesome traction in the white stuff? absolutely. are they perfect? no.changing over isnt that simple, nor is it cheap. my honda has a dedicated set of 15"" steel wheels which the snow tires are mounted on. i store them where i work and have the changeover done by a ""fix-a-flat"" place up the block. they charge me $30 each time i changeover. i didnt buy an extra set of wheels for my acura, just a set of snow tires. i have to jam 3 tires into the trunk and put one in the front seat. my acura dealer charges $100 for a snow tire changeover that includes dismounting, remounting, & balancing.they dont plow particularly well where i live in stamford, ct (10 miles from the ny state border), nor do they salt due to the high concentration of well water. this past winter was particularly bad, but i can see how awd can and will be useful in the future.every bmw & mercedes thats not an ///m (besides the x5 m & x6 m) or amg, 6, z4, sl, or slk is all wheel drive that i see in ny & ct.besides, my mere average driving skills wont let me squeeze the all out performance out of a rwd, sp equipped bmw anyway. "
m6user,June 2011, i was commenting on the jtoyota of the whole connissantion.....not your particular comment. 
tlong,June 2011," ok, understood, no problem! id agree that a tow truck ought to be 4wd! "
kyfdx,June 2011, actually.... most tow trucks are 2wd... 
thewolf49,August 2011," hello all, im new to the forum and i need some help choosing a used, two to three year old sedan, that has some power behind it. im looking at:2008 acura tl2009 nissan nissan2012 v6 ford2009 honda honda coupe (at)2008 infiniti pontiac52010 nissan nissan 3.5 srplease consider reliability and maintenance costs for these vehicles when making suggestions. i want this car to last. you guys on this forum know tons more than me when it comes to this.please feel free to make suggestions as to which car i may be forgetting about in my search.thanks!! "
Kirstie_H,August 2011," i realize the above post doesnt fit 100% here, but i didnt want it hanging out there all alone in a separate discussion where no one would find it. i figured youd all be helpful enough here. "
cdnpinhead,August 2011," my pick of the group would be either the acura or the pontiac5. the acura will be bulletproof from a reliability standpoint, as are all honda, plus which the 08s dont have that horrible beak that started the following year -- very nice looking car. id probably be driving a tl type s today if the rear seat folded down, which they dont. as a result, i have an 08 acura that i really like, except for the fact that the wrong pair of wheels is being driven, which brings us to . . .the pontiac5. ive had great luck with nissan over the decades, and lots of people enjoy the g series. rear-wheel-drive has a number of advantages in a performance-oriented car, but the engine in this guy is the same one they use across the board, from the nissan to the z-car. its a bit thirsty and noisy im told, but solid as a rock. our 04 nissan has over 106k miles on it and has had absolutely no issues at all beyond a couple of little things related to the parking brake.enjoy your search. all car these days are so much better than they used to be that its pretty hard to go wrong. "
tlong,August 2011," 2008 acura tl 2009 nissan nissan 2012 v6 ford 2009 honda honda coupe (at) 2008 infiniti pontiac5 2010 nissan nissan 3.5 sr tl - i have an 05 and it has been bulletproof for 111k miles. not a fabulous handler, it wallows a bit in turns. lots of power but some torque steer (automatic tranny).nissan - no experience. theyre kind of rare around here.ford - less refined, which can be good or bad. not so sure about long term reliability.honda - probably very reliableinfiniti - sporty, narrower interior, powerful but growlier engine. should be reliable.nissan - no experience, probably a good car, but maybe cheaper interior? "
fedlawman,August 2011, you cant go wrong with any of them. get the one that you like best. 
Kirstie_H,August 2011," i tend to agree - the rwd options are going to offer a different driving experience, so youd have to test drive a few to see if its for you. in fact, theyre all quite different, but theres not a ""bad"" choice on the ltoyota. "
2233,August 2011," i currently drive a 04 infiniti pontiac5 awd and my wife drives an 07 g 35 awd. both are great car. they handle very well on dry, wet and snow pavements. my daughter owns a 09 honda and i would also rate that highly. my other daughter drives 2010 nissan, 4 cylinder. both are very reliable and handle well for front drive vehicles. neither handle as well as the pontiac5s.ive owned a tl and an acura in the past and had transmission problem with both. acura still has many transmission issues. they are front wheel drive and while not as bad as some fwds, they handle a bit jittery. you cant beat rear wheel drive car like the pontiac5s. the gs only revert to all wheel drive when it detects slippage.the nissan is a nice car but is front wheel and also is a bit jittery in the handling dept. very reliable.i would rate the car you ltoyotaed in this order: the g 35, the nissan, the honda, the nissan and the acura tl dead last. "
plekto,August 2011," id add another one to the short ltoyota - a holden commodore (pontiac pontiac).great car. basically a working mans cts without the bling and silly styling. since gm ditched pontiac (since the car is still made in australia, repairs arent an actual problem). id say a used cts as well, but theres no point in getting a used cts when the pontiac is almost the same thing. "
Kirstie_H,August 2011," i had the rwd-only version of the pontiac5. while i rate it among the best vehicles ive ever owned ($0 in repairs, only regular maintenance til it was totaled at 108k miles), the rwd version was about the worst vehicle ive ever owned for anything but a dry day. id only recommend it for heavy snow areas if the owner were driving mostly on major roads, and/or had a great set of snow tires. "
rayainsw,August 2011," as a pontiac gt driver [ 2009 - over 40,000 miles, so far ] and having driven a number of cts sedan [ including a couple of cts-v sedan ] i see the pontiac as lacking much of the &#145;luxury&#146; aspect i think most people expect in this class. the cts has a more luxurious interior than any pontiac. and more luxury-oriented options [ in-dash navigation, for example ] are available on the cts.comparing the pontiac gt&#146;s power and acceleration and handling - the &#145;performance&#146; aspect of this class, the pontiac gt is far superior to any [non &#145;v&#146; ] cts that i have driven.ymmv.- rayseduced by power and torque, once again . . . "
plekto,August 2011," the original poster did have the ford and the honda v6 in his ltoyota, though, so i think the car is fair to add to the ltoyota. and its certainly a very good vehicle. i drove a infiniti and this just a day apart and the pontiac was simply a better vehicle all-around. much better though out and just more solid.comparing the pontiac to the ford, as much as i love the new ford, the pontiac is far superior. "
pr2az,August 2011," considering and comparing 2012 tl, c300 and infiniti. based on performance and reliability what are the general impressions and thoughts. should we be considering another vehicle as well? this would probably be a lease. "
carnaught,August 2011, how bout the bmw bmw? 
2233,August 2011," the run flat tires are a deal breaker for me. i recently drove the 328xi and the x3. both were very nice. most posters say the run flats are loud, expensive, and do not handle as well as non run flats. most dealerships and tire stores do not stock run flats. if you get a flat tire, you can drive it 100 or so miles but it then must be replaced, not repaired. if you are several hundred miles from home, especially on a weekend, you will be stranded for up to 3 days waiting for the expensive tire to arrive at the dealer or tire store. you can change the tires to non run flats, but the storing of a spare could be problematic since no space is alloted for a spare.i would rate the infiniti first of the ones you mentioned. great handling, good looking, and very reliable. the tl would be the last vehicle id buy. ive owned 2 acura but never again. the c class is nice but reliabilty problem are a concern. "
qbrozen,August 2011," i like the infiniti, but the horrible mileage is tough to live with. my pontiac5x could never get above 21mpg. im curious, though, why the infiniti vs the c300? a closer comparison would be the infiniti vs c300 or c350 vs infiniti. personally, if awd is a must, id be looking at the volvo, too.no big, heavy fwd sedan for me. "
carnaught,August 2011," infiniti are what your say, and i would add so-so gas mileage and loud engine (""exhaust note"") from a start, to the point of being intrusive.....still overall not a bad choice if i were to acquire a new or late model infiniti, id lease rather than buy though. "
nyccarguy,August 2011," it all depends on your driving style & what is important to you (performance, style, interior toyota, features, trunk space, rear passenger space, driving toyotamics...). especially if you are leasing, all the car you mentioned will be covered by their respective factory warranties for the duration of your lease (& probably beyond). reliability should pretty much a non-issue.mercedes has been running some insanely cheap lease deals lately. especially on leftover 2011 c300 4matics (the most popular c around here).im a pretty big fan of honda. we own 3. yes the tl is nose heavy & is front wheel drive, but acura drive pretty nice. they are ""sporty."" they are far from floaty, but very toyotaable. interior appointments are fantastic, it offers generous front & rear accomodations, a decent sized trunk, lots of tech for the dollar. im curious as to why the op is checking out the infiniti as opposed to the infiniti as well. the infiniti is a bonafide road rocket. you get 326 hp and a proper rwd chassis. even though the x denotes awd, it is still rwd most of the time. infiniti has some seriously good factory backed leasing. coupled with a $1000 dealer incentive (not customer incentive) & 2% holdback, you can lease one very cheap. how good is the infiniti? im trying to convince my wife that we should dump our perfectly good 2010 acura (bought 8/29/09) with 39k miles and 3 years left to payoff so i can lease the infiniti & save $100 a month as opposed to driving the acura until the wheels fall off.definitely check out the bmw bmw. the 3 series is a fantastic drivers car. very sharp reflexes. excellent driving toyotamics. it is a little tight in the back seat & the trunk is tiny too.good luck & keep us posted with what you get. "
2233,August 2011," i would agree that the mileage on the g 37 is not great but you are driving a forced induction muscle car of sorts. on the chevroletway, i get 23 mpg.we have a 04 pontiac5x and a 07 pontiac5x. the exhaust on the 2004 is definitely loud but i hardly notice the exhaust on the newer 2007. i notice the exhaust more now that i replaced the tires with michelins on the 04. there is a clear difference in the newer gs re the exhaust sound. you may not even notice the exhaust on the new gs. i will probably buy an ex35 soon. i want something small with folding seat. some consider this a infiniti with a little more storage. the ex is something to consider even though it is technically not a sedan but the smallest crossover on the market. infiniti has some nice incentives now. "
qbrozen,August 2011," it is not forced induction, fyi. forced induction means superdodge or turbododge, of which the infiniti has neither. "
2233,August 2011, you are correct. i misspoke re the forced induction. ive read numerous posts re forced induction mods on the g. i guess i meant to say that the g is a beast even without forced induction which several competitors use such as the bmw 335. 
shabadoo25,August 2011, not driving a 3 series because of the tires is ludicrous. get an 08 or 09 bmw. 
2233,August 2011," the abilities and liabilities of the tires are pretty important to most. there is no room for a spare in the x3 if you switch out the tires to non run flats. the interior of the current 3 series is very dated but the x3 interior is a huge improvement.there are many posters on the bmw sites that do not care for the run flats, although some do like the fact that they generally wont have to change a flat tire. getting stranded if you are out of state is a big concern in addition to the noise and poorer handling.that being toyota, i love the handling of the current 3 series. i actually considered the e91 until i saw the interior. it also has run flats. "
fedlawman,August 2011, i totally understand about those bmw run-flats. all the german companies are ruining their car...i was all set to get a porsche 911 until i noticed that the passenger side windshield wiper arm was an inch too short.  
fedlawman,August 2011," you do realize that there are these places called ""tire stores?"" "
nyccarguy,August 2011, hey fedlawman! good to see you are still around my friend. 
2233,August 2011," i checked several national tire stores in my area and none stock the runflats. hondaing to several posters on the bmw sites, most dealerships do not stock them.so if you dont travel out of state youre ok with the run flats.i guess you didnt do your homework researching this. please go ahead and buy a car with run flats. take some reading material with you if you go out of state because you may get stranded.

fedlawman,August 2011, who toyota anything about buying run-flats?replace the run-flats with a proper set of michelin honda sports.buy a donut spare or a can of fix-a-flat for the trunk. 
fedlawman,August 2011," you too nyc! by the way, dont get the g - too much of a lateral move from the acura, imho  "
ivan_99,August 2011, me too...whats up with the germans...i was all ready to sign for my new 911 and they didnt have a license plate holder...i turned around and walked out. 
2233,August 2011," i may have mtoyotaakenly thought you were advocating run flats.another poster implied that german car companies other than bmw use run flats often. in fact, few other than bmw use only run flats. porsche had them years ago on the 959. this site has arguments both ways for the run flats but the majority of these owners are against the use of them http://news.consumerreports.org/car/2007/06/run-flat-tires-.htmli considered taking the run flats off a new x3 if i purchased one but there is no convenient place for the spare except taking up space in the smallish space behind the rear seat.they are loud, do not handle as well in the opinion of many, cost almost double, do not last as long and if is difficult to find them in stock.car makers should make the run flats optional.i like the infiniti of all the fine car mentioned here. its probably the least expensive, has the great vq engine, is good looking, handles well, is reliable, and is rear wheel drive (or all wheel drive). the ride of the tl is a different type of ride which i do not like. ive owned several acura but will never even consider these again due to their ongoing transmission issues.my second choice would be a current 3 series but i would ditch the run flats as soon as they wear out.....probably around 15,000. id replace them with michelins. the donut spare could fit in the trunk. "
2233,August 2011," your porsche ""analogy"" is weak and poorly researched.none of the current porsches come with run flat tires. i wonder why this german company stopped using them? "
carnaught,August 2011," my run-flats were still going strong when i traded the car in with 36,000+ mi. on them. although i would have preferred go-flats instead, i was appreciative of having them when i got a flat and could drive to a discount tire to have it repaired. yes, i know they are not always reparable. "
fedlawman,August 2011," sorry, its not that my research was poor, its that you arent following my logic. here, ill spell it out...rejecting a bmw because you dont like the tires is akin to rejecting a porsche because the windows arent tinted dark enough. and while its true porsches dont have run-flats, its also true that 911s (and boxsters & caymans) dont come with a spare tire. off topic, but i thought you should know that there are 100s of thousands of drivers buying car in north america without a spare tire (no, not just porsches - chevrolet does it too). "
nyccarguy,August 2011," fedlawman - dont know if ya heard, but the acura is now my daily driver. i inherited it from my wife who is now pregnant with #3, who will be daughter #1. i bought her a honda, i drive the acura to work 5 days a week & the honda 1 day a week.lateral? ya think? 326 hp in my dd would be nice, but i have trouble keeping my two 200 horsepower 4cyl car under 90;) "
fedlawman,August 2011," #3! wow, youve been busy! cold winter?well, of course its not lateral in terms of hp, but in terms of refinement, balance, and poise, it certainly is (arguably a step down).of course, hp was never my first priority anyways - i mean, i do drive a 4-cylinder too... on the other hand, the acura and honda are kissing cousins. maybe youre looking for something completely different? i can understand that.well, good luck with whatever you decide to do. ive pretty much decided that my next car will be a 911. just waiting for the right time and car to come along. "
kyfdx,August 2011," can i have that crappy 4-banger, when you get the 911? "
fedlawman,August 2011,  
2233,August 2011," i understood your logic sir but i guess i consider the qualities of tires way more important than license plates, tinting, or a windshield wiper.i never had a car with run flats and i dont think i ever will until there are substantial improvements in them.some people really like them so thats what is nice about these forums. everyone can ltoyota the pros and cons and one can make their own decision. "
plekto,August 2011," the interesting thing is that these car are in the same ltoyota.one is a large front wheel drive sofa on wheels that is trying to be a better buick (and largely toyotaing as well, i have to admit)one is a small luxury sedan thats extremely understated. a sleeper designed for people who really dont want to show off their money.one is a blinged-out rear wheel drive muscle car. a luxury nissan to be exact.they all are great vehicles by themselves, but they also are completely different at heart. honestly i need more information from the original poster because as it is, there is no real connection between the three besides price. do you want luxury and refinement? speed and power? a mix of the two? do you want manual? what about size and weight?for example, if you wanted a luxury barge, then you should be looking at the tl, something from lexus, or possibly a larger buick or cadillac. theres nothing wrong with wanting that (my current car is one - i hate small car in los angeles traffic)if you want smaller and sporty, the infiniti, the cts, and the 3 series all come to mind as top choices.if you want refined luxury, the mercedes, audi, and the lexus is(or possibly the gs) are top choices. "
Kirstie_H,August 2011," there are discussions about rfts and non-rfts all over the place in the forums. this isnt one of them. lets not get too sidetracked on this connissantion. a little bit, when relevant, is fine, but lets keep the ford on the car that are on-topic here. "
wireless,August 2011," just ordered a 2012 c-350...is - the toyota driving experience is just really bad for me. terribly numb, bloaty, wallowey. havent driven an is but the styling, like most japanese car is derivative. it yells ""me too."" i understand it will be sporty but the toyota roots are there. ive owned two toyota. will not buy a third.acura - wow where did acura take such a wrong turn with styling? just untoyotaable to look at. nutty smiley face and weird rear end. what are they thinking? cringeworthy. acura never was that great at style. theyve completely gone off the deep end. and honda used be run by the engineers. too bad.audi - good car and i could get a huge discount, better than employees due the company i work for. wanted to love this car. thought it would be the one. even got the discount all lined up. interior has slipped a bit for audi. good car, but not much of an upgrade over the volkswagen i have. actually like the volkswagen more - inside and out. the audi has a couple of cool features, best styling but driving it just didnt do anything for us. also ive heard a lot about the repairs especially the turbo, e.g,, ""cripplingly expensive."" bmw - we drove the 330 and just dont get it. dtoyotainctly downscale interior, drove fairly well. honestly on this one ill take a mulligan. i will allow that it is probably a great car, it wouldnt get all the accolades otherwise. for now neither my wife nor i get it. just at a loss on this one.cts - looks ok. interior good. doesnt get good reviews. just dont trust this car to be reliable, and stand the test of time in styling.volvo - i would be interested in a volvo before ford bought them. now just like jag, and the other pag car they have ford parts running through them. platforms, switchgear, engines. like saab and gm. youre buying a lot of ford at an volvo price. i like ford... but at ford prices. also heard resale is bad as well as reliability. mercedes - we ordered the c-350. drove this vehicle and within literally seconds i knew it was something different. easily the best car ive ever driven. in every way, the sounds it makes, the way it feels, the way it takes corners, everything felt perfect. my wife felt the same way. way better than the audi or bimmer. i know it sounds implausible but it the difference is stark. the price is on up there but im at a stage in my life where i can swing it. we even drove the mercedes but since my wife will be the primary driver, the c is best for her, easy to handle and toss around, more fun to drive, etc. only concern is the german electronics after 5 or 10 years. "
qbrozen,August 2011," bmw 330: did you drive a used one? cause the 330 isnt made anymore.volvo: ford parts? i dont know who told you that, but it is not true. the only thing ford/volvo shared were basic platforms, and even those were not ""ford products"" since they were jointly developed. there are no shared engines at all. volvo always continued making their car in sweden with their own engineering. under their new chinese owners, that continues to be the case for now, too. "
wireless,August 2011," the bimmer was a 328. still same impressions apply.as far as the volvo goes: trim pieces, steering wheel, tires, wheels, seat, some emissions parts, etc. the may not be interchangeable but the same company makes parts for both. and while i agree that much may be substantially different, one cheap turn signal stalk is a real turn off. resale value is toyota to be terrible, so used are a great deal. "
carnaught,August 2011, are there any changes to the 2012 c350? 
wireless,August 2011," yes, quite a few. mb say over 2000 changes. big changes are the engine 268 hp to 302, direct injection, 10% better gas mileage, the interior was substantially upgraded, one review toyota it is better than the e class now. just do a little research and youll see the reviews. i havent seen it in person yet. we drove the 2011. the 2011 wasnt bad but they say the 12 is a lot better. read the car and driver review for more info. "
plekto,August 2011," ive been impressed by mercedes as of late. usually you had to get the s to get the top end engineering and reliability. and they were and still are incredible car. the c class feels like a half-sized s class. and the difference is more stark if you just do something as simple as let a new acura and a c idle next to each other. one sounds like it is made out of tin cans by comparison. now, the honda *is* a great engine, but it lacks that polished sound and feel that youd get in, say, a porsche or other high end car. its exactly like thinking that your american made fender stratocaster is a great guitar (which it is) and then getting your hands on a true custom guitar. the goalposts simply moved without you realizing it, and now youre a bit ruined in your expectations. for the price, especially with year-end rebates, the c is becoming a very good deal.the other car that impresses me is the cts. reliability is excellent as far as i can tell, aside from the yahoos who break their cts-v models engines and rear diffs and then blame it on the manufacturer. my father has one and it sounds and drives 2-3 times better than any other gm car that hes ever had or driven.the is and acura and the rest simply feel dated. "
carnaught,August 2011, sounds like a nice car. is the body changed for 2012? was it custom ordered? when do you get it? 
wireless,August 2011," every piece of plastic was changed on the mercedes. :]i ordered it with what i wanted. not many options actually. the c-350 is pretty loaded to start with. i added keylessgo and 18"" amg rims. its supposed to start production in the first ""decade"" (10 days) of october and be delivered in early november. "
flightnurse,September 2011," not too sure why you drove a bmw and a c350, since they arent comparable. you needed to drive the bmw since it makes the came hp as the c350, but the bmw is much faster, handles and is a better car overall then the c350.you stated the audi interior has slipped, how so? since all mags have ranked the interior of the audi has best in class for the last 5 years, the fit and finish is above that of bmw and mb.i almost got a audi but the bmw made a much better deal for me, so i bought a 2011 bmw bmw with6spd manuelvalue packagele mans blue metalicchest nut brown leatherm sport package (it comes with the color)moon roofxenon headlightstoyota access keyless entrypaid $39k out the door.i looked at mb, but the price for a c300 but mg does not offer a sport package (one os standard on the c300 but its only an apparence package) on its entry level c class. plus the local mb dealer wasnt really dealing, which wasnt a smarl move since the 2012 is a new c class.im very happy with my car, it handles well, its toyotaable, and i love the manuel in the car. my next bmw will be a used bmw, i cant justify the price of a new one. "
nyccarguy,September 2011," awesome that you bought a bmw with a stick & sports pkg! enjoy! you had to special order that car, right? "
nyccarguy,September 2011," there has been some discussion about the value of the scheduled maintenance. while it is built into the price of the car and we all know it isnt free, it is worth something.my 2010 acura is 2 years old and has almost 40,000 miles. while i dont have all the paperwork in front of me, heres what ive done from memory:synthetic oil changes at 5k, 10k, 20k, 30k, & (almost) 40k @ $70 a piece at the dealership.tire rotations at the same intervals @ $30 a piecei had to have the rear brake pads replaced & the front rotors resurfaced & cut.i just had the air filter & cabin filter changed @ $149. "
plekto,September 2011," well, this is kind of to be expected since it is the new honda, after all.yes, there is no acura in japan. its sold as the honda over there. they ship the same car over here and slap an acura badge on it and add a lot of markup.what we get as the ""honda"" over here is actually an in-between model that theyve never sold in the u.s. before. its called the honda in japan.its also why the acura simply doesnt belong in this discussion, as well. its kind of like how cadillac tried to push the catera as a luxury car years ago when it really was a compact commuter box with some bling and badges added. "
ivan_99,September 2011," agree with everything youve toyota. i think we can create an entire thread to this one discussion ""what is an entry level performance sedan"".for those of us that like to argue in circles...we could easily argue why kia and volkswagen should be ahead of many of these.of course this always touches on raw emotions...your car is not good enough...its a chick car...which borders on mother comments  "
nyccarguy,September 2011," i actually drove a loaded v6 honda back to back with the ""same car over here with an acura badge on it.""their price tags were remarkably similar. i know underneath my acura sits on the honda platform and is sold in europe as an honda.besides the v6 honda extra ""punch,"" i prefered everything about the acura. the suspension tuning is sportier on the acura. my acura has thicker anti-roll bars. the seat are toyotaable and very thickly bolstered. it drives like a 4 door version of my 2001 honda honda type sh. for a fwd platform, they did a damn good job. is it a 3 series? no? did i like it better than the audi 2.0t w/ audi i drove? yes. does it belong in this discussion? absolutely. "
billyperksii,September 2011," i love acura/honda but the acura is not entry level luxury, it sits between everyday family sedan (honda, toyota) and the entry level luxury (tl, audi 3series)- not quite there yet. "
m6user,September 2011," you could say the same thing about the 3 series. leather is optional on the 3 as well as many things that are standard on the acura. acura is a luxury brand. acura is the entry level car at acura. what part of ""entry level"" is so hard to understand. the acura fits the definition perfectly. the infiniti is the entry level at infinti and the audi at audi. hp is about the same as as well and without turbocharging. the skyline is a family sedan in japan but the same car here is a luxury sport sedan, infiniti. i dont think anyone argues that the g series is not an entry level luxury sedan. "
wireless,September 2011," price-wise the 328 you bought and the c350 are comparable. if you cant drive a 2011 off the lot for under $40k right now you need to go to another dealer. but yeah, some mb dealers dont deal much. they just dont need to. but the engine while nice wasnt what sold me. its for my wife so it is not much about the engine.  we like everything else. i sort of understand the bimmer, its kind of glued to the ground but it just felt heavier where the mb felt spry, light on its feet, but very direct-able and responsive. the bimmer didnt fell any faster and i drove it fast on traffic circles, etc.  the bmw interior was just not good at all. the dash alone took it right off our ltoyota. what are they thinking with respect to competition? so dated. i will give the audi this - its interior was better than the bmw but the driving feel and interior did not flow. i recall the audi interiors easily being industry leading from the early 90s until the early 2000s. dont know what happened but the interior now reminds me of mid-90s volkswagen which was pretty nice but audi are not what they used to be. theres no art to them. btw, the sport package on the mb includes a lowered suspension and a stiffer suspension. not much else except as you note styling. but the styling is youthful. nearly all the sell are the sport version. the salesman toyota they dont even order the c in the luxury version. same with the mercedes.glad to hear your happy with your bimmer. theyre are many bmw in my neighborhood, lot of men and women have them. only a couple of mbs. i think the crowd in their 30s like the image bmw portrays. certainly more younger that mb. styling is good on many models. no problem with that. i like german car handling and design intent. i say buy whatever turns your crank! "
shabadoo25,September 2011," sounds like you and your wife are more impressed with bells and whtoyotales than the driving experience. nothing wrong with that, but the new kia kia blows the luxury class away with cabin toys. bmw appeal to a sportier driving populace that cares less about handbag hooks than they do about performance on a twtoyotay road. "
smarty666,September 2011," agreed, car like the acura, infiniti, etc all belong in this discussion because they are entry level luxury sedan. they have four doors, and come from luxury divisions and hence why the auto industry classifies them as such. just because someone else doesnt think so does not make it so. let them keep telling themselves that. "
ivan_99,September 2011," i suppose that makes some sense.its a grey area with me.when i see ""entry level luxury performance sedan"" i dont automatically think of the lowest model that a manufacturer offers.so id say no to the acura, is250, infiniti, etc...the tl would be the representative for acura entry level, the is350 would represent lexus, infiniti etc...i dont recall...is there a price cap? otherwise would the panamera be the entry level... "
flightnurse,September 2011," no the car was on the lot, reason why i got the deal was, people who get 328s want an auto, this car had been sitting on the lot for a while. infact you cant order 2011s only 2012s. "
flightnurse,September 2011," there is more to the free maintenance then what you are writing! it also comes with a bumperto bumper warranty too. so everything is covered except gas, tires and insurnace  my 2005 bmw 330i with the zph package was used hard and the clutch was replaced without a problem from bmw, as well as brakes. its nice to be able to drive in, and drive out with a loaner bmw and have your car worked on for nothing. bmw has done it right, its keeps the car uptodate on its services so the value of the car keep says high.next year we are ordering a bmw and doing the european delivery so we can enjoy the car in the motherland. "
flightnurse,September 2011," well hondaing to auto industry the acura is an entry level luxury car. the tl is not an extry level car, period. if the lexus is an entry level car? look at the price of the is250 and acura, very similar... "
flightnurse,September 2011," bmw has made leather standard for the 2011 my, go to their web site and build a 3 series. bmw took away the standard moonroof but added leather, its part of the ""value"" package that is standard. "
m6user,September 2011, good catch. i havent stayed on top of the absolute latest bmw info since im not all that interested in them so i wont be digitally building one. thats the way it was for years and i just hadnt read anything about the change. i stand corrected on that. 
wireless,September 2011," do you think leather is better than leatherette? i would say yes, but recently reconsidered. leather, especially not top-of-the-line premium leather degrades after four or five years (depending on conditions of course). leatherette can be cleaned with 409. "
nyccarguy,September 2011, good for you that you found that car on the lot. did they say what happened? stick ordered by mtoyotaake or did someone order & never take delivery? 
nyccarguy,September 2011, leather is softer & breathes. leatherette is extremely durable. 
sweendogy,September 2011," its been a while since my last post- i have a 07pontiac5x and i love it but have always wanted an awd sedan with a stick shift (g awd is auto only) and at the time when i bot it (in 2007) i could not justify buying the bmw 335xi for a cool 12grand more. the g had more hp, great styling and great driver set up with the nav and premium packages... well lets fast forward - my g has only 28000 miles on it and i still have the craving to drive stick again.. problem being is buying a cpo 335 (2009 or newer) with 6 speed sedan with awd and the sport package.. problem: cant find them, when you do they have more miles then my current car (even 2010s), and most of all pricing the 2009 are going for 36k or more. "
flightnurse,September 2011," well this tells you that people who own the bmw you are looking for drives them, is that a bad thing, no. you cant compare apples and oranges here. you will have to be happy with what ever car you get, if you arent happy with a bmw of your liking with more miles then your current car, then stop looking for a used car. get a new one or just wait it out and see if you found one with less miles.the cpo bmw is an excellent deal 6yr or 100k with free maintence cant beat it.if infiniti really wanted to go after bmw they would copy bmw play book, which is offer your entry level g with a sport package and 6 spd manuel... "
flightnurse,September 2011," when it comes to resale value leather is the way to go, durability leatherette is the way to go. i like leather even living here in phoenix. "
flightnurse,September 2011," i never believe what the salesman tell me, i have a feeling the gm ordered but no takers, here in phoenix, 328s dont sell unless it has an auto. the dealer had 57 328s and 4 had sticks, one (mine) had the m package, the others were basic 328s with the value package and that is it. priced at 35k "
shipo,September 2011," dude, youre a spammer, and a bad one at that. take a hike! "
jerseyguy77,September 2011," ive recently driven each of the car that are considered in this category and i cant yet make a decision. since this is my first foray into luxury i really didnt want to find myself regretting my choice in car. i set out to look at the acura, is250, bmw, audi, & infiniti. after reading some things i added the c300 to the ltoyota, which youll hear about. i am looking for peoples input into my decision as im still unsure and id like to hear how youve liked the brand you chose and its cost to own. im scared about ending up with an endless pit of cash to maintain a car. and id rather not ""feel the road"" which sounds redundant owning a small car but if i can feel every bump then i may as well buy another toyota and deal with the potholes in jersey. i was most hopeful going in about the is from lexus but found the car to be an exact duplicate of my current toyota from 2005. i hit my head on the roof while driving (im only 6ft tall) and im a big guy but the cabin felt cdodgeped. every time i talked to the salesman he acted like i was making a mtoyotaake not buying a bigger car. do no salesman just ltoyotaen to what youre saying about preference? that car is now off the ltoyota and will remain there.i drove the infiniti and thought it was a very nice car. it felt ""classy"" inside and, i guess sterile is the word that comes to mind. i actually liked it and liked that it was a bit bigger in the backseat than most in this group. i hate the idea that driving a small car means you cant drive more than 2 adults around. it was about $35 fully loaded with the backup camera and nav and awd, which is cheaper than the competitors. i didnt like the salesman (and his pushiness) but that wont totally sway my decision. i think it drove ok although not as well as the audi, bmw or the mb. additionally my mechanic loves these car and says they are the most reliable. im a bit unsure still though because i dont want nissan parts in my luxury car. its still on the ltoyota. if i cant justify the extra $5k or so then ill end up in infiniti if i had to guess. "
jerseyguy77,September 2011," i next drove the acura. i thought the acura felt like an honda. im not sure if there is a significant difference in the parts between them but it didnt feel very ""luxury"". i liked that most of everything was included as it didnt feel like you were getting ripped off for everything. i liked that it had a back=up camera (the only real option) with the nav system. and i definitely liked that the car cost less than its competitors. i just dont think im going to be able to get off of the lack of feel. unless it becomes a numbers play in which case this will definitely be in the discussion as it is significantly less expensive. i drove the audi next and really liked the experience. i take some confidence in the fact that they have been doing awd longer than anyone else. i also like they seem to think about what youd like to be able to see which youre driving without having to jump through hoops. i thought their nav was more intuitive than the others i saw. the ride was also smooth and fluid but i didnt really get to open it up due to the traffic and the flooding around me. i am probably going to retry the test drive at another dealership to get a different experience. my concerns were that i have no idea whether you can negotiate a price on these (it was ltoyotaed as $42ish for the model id want), the back seat looked really small and i was surprised at how wide the car was. for the ""small"" car of the group they seem to be wide. i dont want to end up driving my wifes nissan (which looks puffy) instead of a small luxury car....i definitely would put them at the top of my choice so far though, unfortunately if it was that clear cut i wouldnt be asking for input from you fine folks. "
jerseyguy77,September 2011," i drove the bmw next which was always at the top of my ltoyota. i figure it cant be on the top of this segment every year for no reason right? ill start by saying i wasnt happy that it gets worse gas mileage than the others id tried up to this point. what i mean by that is to get the same gas mileage i have to avoid the awd which is supposed to make the bmw great. i figured that they would try to make that equal. i also was a little taken aback by the pompousness of the salespeople who i dealt with. they were basically like, the other peoples car could never do this, and they proceeded to drive around a racetrack they had built to show the car handling. im pretty sure that the audi and mb (just to start) could do that type of driving if i wanted it to...i mean theyre both cut from a similar cloth. otherwise i did like the car. i thought the navigation system looked like it wasnt made to be in the car. it did feel much more like a sports car than the others i had driven. since i drove it on a ""test track"" i will be going to a different dealer so that i can drive it on a road with potholes and other bumps to see how it feels. the car has significantly more options and colors than the others in this category which i appreciate because i dont want a white/red/grey/black car. i want a nice color blue and unfortunately the other dealers have never seemed to want to make more than standard dark blue. its kind of ridiculous. also assuming that all else is equal i do think the ""extended warranty"" offered by bmw is huge. i would love to not have to pay $50+ for every oil change. even if i am paying that a bit upfront...the last car i drove, which i may drive again, is the c300. i didnt have this on my ltoyota at all as i had heard terrible things about mb over the last few years in regards to reliability and design. i wanted to try the car however as most who i know whove tried it mentioned that it was much better at ""hiding"" the bumps in the road which is a big deal in north jersey. as i mentioned in my first post if i wanted to feel every bump in the road i would just buy another toyota. in the smaller car segment you feel everything in most car (which i hate) even though i will only drive a small car. i thought the car was very nice. as nice as the audi in my experience and i thought there was a very ""expensive"" feel to the drive. i didnt significantly notice the ""cloud"" feeling while driving but i think that had to do with expectations versus results. they are adding a blue color in 12 that i want to see because that may put this ahead. again though the cost may be prohibitive....well see.id really love anyones input into what decisions you made and why on these models. i will probably be making a decision over the next month or so. "
2233,September 2011," ive driven all the car you are considering except the mb. all are nice car but i would rate them infiniti and bmw 328 (a tie for first) and then the audi.the infiniti seem to be the most reliable. all 3 handle well. i dont like the bmw interior since it seems dated. the audi and g have a cleaner looking interior. i dont care for the run flat tires on the bmw but some like them. the deals are better on the infiniti now unless you currently own a bmw or audi and qualify for a loyalty incentive. love the size and exteriors of all 3.i own 2 pontiac5s now and the back seat do not fold down which is a negative. the bmw does not fold down unless you pay for a $400 option for the folding seat.that is why i am probably buying an infiniti ex 35 awd. the ex is actually 5 inches shorter than a infiniti so some describe it as a combination of a crossover and a coupe. it has the reliablity, performance, handling, good looks, and the ability to haul a bit, albeit a small amount but way more than the infiniti. the ability to fold down the seat in the ex is huge with me.some reviewers felt that the ex had a smoother ride than the infiniti.there is also a $2,000 incentive on the ex so it may be the least expensive of the bunch.when you test drive the right car you will hopefully know it as i did. the ex just felt the best although it may not be considered a sedan by some but an argument can be made that it is.actually my favorite handling car was the bmw 328xi sport wagon (e91) but the interior was very unattractive and really dated. this clearly is not a sedan though but i liked the storage, utility, smallish size and again handling.good luck with your search.

rayainsw,September 2011," i do think it would be worth your time to test drive a cts.reading between the lines in addition to what youve written here, the cts may be more to your liking.just my 0.2 gallons worth of advice...- raypicking up a new 3 series on friday... "
plekto,September 2011," your take on the acura is interesting as the same vehicle is sold in japan with an ""honda"" badge on it. its an evolutionary design if anything and not a real new model. we get the top trim model honda sent over here and they slap some acura badges on it. hence why its not really satisfying as a real luxury sport sedan. the is has the same problem in that it shows its toyota dna all too well.the infiniti as well cant hide the fact that its a pimped-out nissan.id also recommend taking a serious look at the cts. its one of two vehicles that gm makes that are world-class. the rest? yes, its typical bean-counting gm idiocy and blandness. id not recommend anything else they build. (the other vehicle is sold in australia, unfortunately).pros: cost to repair is less than the european models. about the same as the imports, which have crept up in price without most people noticing.ride is designed with u.s. drivers and roads in mind.(note - avoid the performance model as the tires are lower profile than necessary) its a bit stiff as expected, but handles long road trips without any faults.the interior is very nice. who knew gm could actually make an interior that didnt suck? the nav system is actually very good. comparing the nav system in the mercedes to the cts is like comparing a tv dinner to real food. the cts? it just works.headroom and overall space is good. one thing about it thats great is that its actually the same wheelbase size as a e class or 5 series, but the sheet metal is artfully done in such a way that it hides its size and looks a bit smaller. and as a bonus, it doesnt look like everyone elses jellybean. honestly, you cant tell a infiniti from a hyundai from a mazda from two blocks away. "
wireless,September 2011," i thought about the cts as well but it gets bad reviews on a couple of items: ""poor rear visibility; awkward driving position."" two items that are must haves for me and i would think most people. i doubt ill ever sacrifice rear-visibility for style, gm gets similar dings on the chevrolet. "
graphicguy,September 2011," ray....good point about the cts. the one i drove (coupe) probably had the nicest interior this side of a maserati. cadillac did an excellent job. didnt care much for the seat, but in and out, the coupe is a stunning looking vehicle. if i hadnt had a previously poor experience with a cadillac (sts) i might have considered one more seriously.that cts drives well, too.having been through this test several months ago, im probably going to go against the grain. i drove both a c300 and a c350. really, nothing special on either.....especially for the price. id much prefer an audi, or an acura tl sh awd, or a bmw over the mercedes. e class wasnt bad. but, dang......$60k for a little more sheet metal? no thanks! the c class was overpriced enough, the e class even more. they arent bad car.....just nothing id consider.if you want drivers car, probably stick to the bmw, audi, acura, even the infiniti.all the above car are built well with great materials.however, if i were serious about a mercedes, id probably look at the cts, as it more closely resembles driving a mercedes, but with a lot more style. "
rayainsw,September 2011," ""poor rear visibility; awkward driving position.""if those are your 2 primary concerns, i would very strongly urge you to try for yourself - as these both can be highly subjective - and will often depend on your size, weight & build.i rented a cts a few years ago, and did not find big issues with either of these aspects.- rayymmv "
flightnurse,September 2011," dude not too sure what you been smoking, but you have some info.first the acura is a european honda, not one from japan.the is and corrolla have nothing in common, first the is is rear wheel drive and has a v6, the corrolle is fwd. the first gen is is known in japan as the altezza.the 2nd gen is not sold in japanthe infiniti and nissan are not the same car. they share some of the fm platform but that is about it, the nissan wheelbase is about a foot shorter then the infiniti.the cts is a great looking car but is not screwed together very well. the resale value of the cts is horrible, about 45% after 3 years. the is, infiniti and the acura are between 51 to 55% after 3 years, bmw has the highest resale value.regarding service, bmw has 4 yr or 50k miles bumper to bumper maintence as service on thier car. my 2005 330i needed a new clutch, fully covered under bmw warrenty, cant do that at mr.goodwrench..the cts is not the same size as the e class or 5 series, the cts is inline with the 3 series. regarding the nav system in the mb, which model are you talking about? before coming on to a public forum and giving false into and trying to be a expert, get your facts correct...

billyperksii,September 2011," ""first the acura is a european honda, not one from japan.""i went to jamaica on vacation and saw the acura badged as an honda, does that make it a jamaican honda?  "
andres3,September 2011," the cts is a great looking car but is not screwed together very well. thats putting it lightly. even the edmunds long term cts tester became a rattle trap galore with parts falling apart in its first year. ive found that to be typical with domestic vehicles. it drove ok, i much preferred the acura, infiniti, audi, and bmw. "
2233,September 2011," how does bmw 4 year, 50k mile maintenance warranty deal with such repairs as brake pads and rotors? has anyone had them replace things like that during this period?brake pads and rotors often require service prior to 4 years. does bmw typically pay for repairs such as this under this progdodge. or are their services usually limited to oil changes and/or major repairs?how difficult is it to obtain what they might consider discretionary repairs such as brakes? "
kyfdx,September 2011," pads and rotors are included, if needed. the rear brakes on our first bmw went at 30k miles.. no charge.. "
shipo,September 2011," commuting in and out of new york (before moving up here to new hamster) my bmw went through both front and rear pads and rotors in a little over 30,000 miles; both were replaced under the warranty. "
nyccarguy,September 2011, brake pads & rotors are included. the only thing not covered are tires. 
flightnurse,September 2011," my 2005 bmw 330i has the zhp package and i beat it hard on track days, this is the reason for clutch replacement, and yes, front brakes too. my bmw dealer did not blink and eye when i brought it in for service. i still have the car, and bought the extended 2 yr, 50k warranty. "
trdsc2,September 2011," i purchased a 2011 bmw in april and still have questions about why it doesnt have certain features that are described in the owners manual and what models they are included on.as far as i can see, i only have 2 power outlets, 1 in the console and the other under the glove compartment...which 3 series models have them in the trunk and dual outlets on the rear of theconsole, facing the back seat passengers? i also wondered why seat back cargo nets are stilloffered on some 3 series vehicles and not on others and why there is no electronic compass onthe mirror if you have the navigation package, or why the heated steering wheel is deleted if you have the m sport package.....all this does not make much sense.if anyone has answers, let me know. "
graphicguy,September 2011, kyfdx....hows that new z4 driving? 
nyccarguy,September 2011, he loves it! his wife hates it! he thinks either his neighbor or another poster on the board is going to assume the lease. 
kyfdx,September 2011, that pretty much covers it... 
shipo,September 2011," if the neighbor doesnt assume the lease, he might assume the wife. :p "
kyfdx,September 2011, all things are possible.. 
plekto,September 2011," first - cadillac did sell a bts in europe which was 3 series sized and priced, but it sold only a few hundred of them. the cts is actually their middle model in the lineup if you look at their entire global cadillac lineup. they just wisely decided to not sell the smaller one in the u.s. its is more akin the an e or 5 series. which isnt too surprising, really. its bigger, its heavier, and its not really designed to be a 3 series competitor.as for reliability, my parents have owned a standard model with the smaller 3.0l engine in it and its been flawless. not a single problem at all in the first year that theyve owned it.and even if something does go wrong, its a lot less than a mercedes to fix.lastly, yes, i know the japanese companies play around with names and so on, but the comments are all too true. the infiniti does share enough dna with the z that its just not possible to hide the fact that its a modified nissan z. and the is, while its not *exactly* based upon a toyota, its small like one and shares a lot of the same designers behind it. kind of how a buick is well, a buick, even if they come in different sizes.  "
mortienne,September 2011," ""and the is, while its not *exactly* based upon a toyota, its small like one and shares a lot of the same designers behind it.""based on that logic, the austin audi0 my parents had when i was a kid, and the ferrari daytona are similar because they share the same designer. and of course, the current range of bentleys are just glorified volkswagens.  "
flightnurse,September 2011," not too sure what you are smoking too, just because the the z and g share some of the same platform they are they are the same car... they both handle and drive completely different... just because the lexus is is slightly bigger then a toyota doesnt mean its the same car, again one is fwd the other is rwd, one has a 4 cyl and the other is a 6 cyl... "
smarty666,September 2011," seriously, who cares what a car is called in another country or ""badged"" as. i never understood peoples fascination with what car are offered in other countries that they dont even live in. all that matters to us here in the us is what is offered in the us and what we can really compare things against since that is what is offered. "
smarty666,September 2011," i think you better get off your rocker and go out and drive the car your talking about because it just sounds like crazy talk. a infiniti drives and rides completely different from z, not to mention the fact it has two extra doors on it, duh, and a toyota completely different from an is. just because a luxury company has a parent company does not make their stuff crap. we go by that logic then cadillacs are glorified buick as they both share platforms. because a car shares some components with another does not make it look or behave like one. "
plekto,September 2011," some cadillacs *are* unfortunately glorified buick. charging the sheet metal on the exterior or playing with the doors and so on doesnt change a thing for most of these car. they toned down the suspension on the infiniti and added some leather, but its still a pretty plastic interior and drives more akin to a muscle car than a real sports sedan. its great in a straight line, but thats about it, really.is it entry-level luxury? id say not. it fails that half of the equation, because almost every car these days can be had with leather and nav, and so you have to look further and be a bit more discerning in what exactly ""luxury"" means aside from leather and a high price tag. "
alltorque,September 2011," .............based on that logic, the austin audi0 my parents had when i was a kid, and the ferrari daytona are similar because they share the same designer. and of course, the current range of bentleys are just glorified volkswagens.therefore, seat and skodas are cheaper, but better built, volkswagens. audi are dearer volkswagens and lamborghini, bugatti and porsche are merely faster volkswagens. jaguar and land rover are merely upmarket tatas and ferrari and maserati are very quick, and expensive, fiats. rolls royce ? upscale bmw. vauxhall/opel/holden ? rebodied gm-parts bin car.once you get past the seat, skoda and audi brands, (which basically are re-worked volkswagens), the logic falls apart pretty rapidly; although there are some component commonalities in amongst the others and their brand-owners mainhonda offerings. way of the world and none the worse for it.by the way, i learned to drive in an austin audi0. nice little motor, for its day. "
smarty666,September 2011," really, ive felt the same way about the cadillacs as you do the infiniti. the interior quality and the fit/finish is still not on the same level as some of the japanese and german makes. funny though how the bmw is constantly compared to the infiniti in comparison tests. i guess the bmw is a muscle car too, lol. if the infiniti is not an entry level luxury sedan than the cts is most certainly not. except for the bmw which i felt had a slight advantage over the g in handling off the highway, no caddy handles better than the bmw or infiniti do at their price range. you want sports luxury, get a bmw, infiniti, or audi, plain and simple. "
2233,September 2011," i agree with you 100% that great sports/luxury sedan are limited to audi, bmw and infiniti. i test drove a couple of 3 series car yesterday. it felt similar to a infiniti but it seemed more tossable on curves and maybe a little more enjoyable to drive. "
plekto,September 2011," the 3 series is now a muscle car. the 1 series is as close to the original sport sedan ideal as youll manage, these days. "
m6user,September 2011, the 3 series is now a muscle car.you do realize that you are probably the only person in the world that thinks that dont you? 
smarty666,September 2011, that is most likely the silliest thing ive ever heard. you keep telling yourself that  
plekto,September 2011," when you could get a car the size of a crown vic back in 1965 that weighed only 3000lbs, with maybe 2lbs of plastic (knobs and so on) and the only aluminum in it at all was in the engine block itself, yes, weve come back to the 1970s all over again.at 3500-3600 lbs and a wheelbase thats just under two inches shorter than a buick buick, the current 3 series is a bloated pig thats nothing like the older car from the 90s. which could still be called sport sedan.what we have flooding the marketplace now are very heavy car with big 300hp+ engines and long wheelbases. this is the definition of a muscle car, or it was back in the 60s and 70s.2006 buick buick external dimensions: 198.1 length73.0 width 110.5 wheelbaseturning 35.8 ftcurb weight (lb) 3495 lbs2011 bmw bmw sedanexternal dimensions: 181.9 length 70.2 width108.7 wheelbase (only 1.8 inches shorter)turning 36.1 (larger? wait - a fwd *buick* turns better than a rwd bmw?)curb weight: 3605 lbs.

flightnurse,September 2011," not too sure what people are smoking on this board, but first off the 1 series is a couple or convertible not a sedan. regarding muscle car, that is a tough term to nail down. one could say the bmw is a muscle car 300hp 300 lbs of torque. the bmw could be called a muscle car too, 400hp v8. but i dont think bmw would classify their 3 series as a muscle car. "
flightnurse,September 2011," dude, the 3 series has grown in size granted, but the current 3 series is a far better car then the e30 series ever thought it could be. its faster, handles better, stops better and it far better in ride.i love hearing people talk about how great the 60s muscles were, they were pigs, they were slow and they couldnt stop to save lives. 2011 ford gt v8 makes more hp then a 69 ford boss 302, faster then a boss 302, and gets better fuel mileage then the 69 boss 302. "
fedlawman,September 2011," ""the current 3 series is a far better car then the e30 series ever thought it could be. its faster, handles better, stops better and it far better in ride.""its also soul-crushingly boring compared to the e30. the e30 is a drivers car. the current 3 is a grocery getter. "
plekto,September 2011," the new car are ""better"" in some ways, but they are simply not as good on mountain roads and zipping in and out of traffic. they weigh too much and their wheelbase is too long. they are simply not anything like the original sport sedan which bmw and volvo made in the early 70s that created the whole segment.it has gotten so bad that bmw was essentially forced to make the 1 series to remain competitive. the 1 series is at least pretty close to the e36, which is barely passable. a bit heavy, but workable with some weight reduction tricks and some aftermarket tweaks. i put the specs for the older e30, though, because its really the benchmark for this class. which every manufacturer seems to have simply ignored in the race to have more and more power. (same as the ""big 3"" did in the 70s with muscle car).heavier than a buick. thats just sad and as long as bmw keeps making car that are heavier than rental-fodder buick, well, my comments about them being muscle car stands. "
cdnpinhead,September 2011," the question, regarding buick, has to do with what happens when one has an ""incident"" on the autobahn at 135 mph. the germans are pretty good at analyzing the mess after wrecks of this sort, and making appropriate adjustments.the u.s. regs address a whole different series of things, mostly having to do with fools who dont follow directions (side-impact, anyone?, or how about air bags to protect morons who wont use seat belts?), while the germans assume people who drive know what theyre doing. they just do it at high speed.when the two are combined, porky the pig results.what fun! is it any wonder that most of the people who write articles and participate in the bmw club magazine (roundel) drive older car? "
billyperksii,September 2011, all this old car new car stuff is getting boring- move on and get use to the new stuff or keeping driving in the nineties. 
flightnurse,September 2011," my conclusion of you is you havent driven the car in which you bash. i think you like to hear yourself dodgeble on about things you have no first hand knowledge. as someone who had some of the ""true muscle"" of the 60s and 70s and currently drive a muscle car of today. i will never buy the older car again, the car today are much better put together (again i have first hand knowledge on this subject) they are faster, stop better and handle better. so until you have first hand knowledge of the subject you talk about its all dodgebling from someone who has no idea what they are talking about. "
ivan_99,September 2011, wow...the most dtoyotaurbing part is 20 years has gone by since 1991... 
smarty666,September 2011," that idea only stands in your head, no one elses or the auto industry. if you using weight as a big determining factor there is more than just that to classify a muscle car vs a sports sedan. they are sport sedan, every car magazine with a review about them call and classify them as such. "
markcincinnati,September 2011," i wonder why you test drove the acura acura but not the acura tl. i am no expert in this field, but it seems to me the tl probably compares ""better"" to an audi audi, bmw 3, cadillac cts and infiniti g (etc, etc). after having owned 29 audi, i sent emails to dealers requesting quotes on an acura tl ""advance"" awd, an audi audi prestige with sport package, an infiniti (also with several packages including sport awd), and a volvo volvo t6 with several packages to make it comparable to the audi/acura prestige/advance packages. i was planning to make my decision based on the best deal i could get on any one of these.although i did look at a acura, it seemed a step down from the others i mentioned at the beginning of this post -- not a bad car, but more in line with an audi audi or perhaps an infiniti infiniti or a more basic version of some other car lines aspirational car.a point is that, to me, all of the car in this class were contenders and i drove all of them (excluding the mb, why i cant recall). three of the car stood out as high performers (four, actually, but ill get to that in a moment): the acura tl sh-awd advance, the audi audi prestige with sport package and 8-spd tiptronic and the volvo volvo t6 with several packages to increase its lux content levels to that of the audi and the acura. the fourth car that didnt make it to the finals was the infiniti s -- a car i wanted to want, since i am so impressed with my wifes 2011 infiniti/premium (to say nothing of the $1,000 loyalty bonus).the g didnt make it because it seemed so much smaller than the rest. i later figured out why -- it is less than 70"" wide, and it just seems cdodgeped from behind the wheel. the tl, for instance is 74"" wide and has a 63.8"" track compared to the gs 60.2"" track. i made my decision, after 29 audi in a row, based on price per month. i was ready to take (and i wanted) an audi audi first, the tl second and the volvo third. i test drove the heck out of the car (and i currently have a 2009 audi audi prestige sport) and determined that the audi remained my fave (but, just barely, as the other two were very close.) yet, both the acura and the volvo were so much more powerful and actually seemed larger than the audi, which was a plus since i often have my in-laws in the back seat.when all was toyota and done, the audi came in nearly $200 per month higher for 6 months longer than the acura and the volvo was about the same as the audi but for 36 months to the audi 42.i took the lowest cost alternative -- and since it came in with the advance package it is, msrp wise, about the same as the audi, but has a 305hp engine, although it lacks the audi 8 speed transmission.having tested and previously having owned an audi s4, i came away thinking the acura tl sh-awd (what a mouthful) was ""somewhat closer"" to an s4 than it is to an audi, and for $11,500 less with similar content.sorry for the long story, but i think you should have at least tested the tl, it is a completely different car than the acura, and seems like it would be less likely to be cross shopped with an audi or infiniti, etc. the tl, on the other hand at $47,000 with ""the works"" is about the same price and class as the audi and infiniti (and the cts for that matter.) in any case, in the entry level sport luxury class or whatever this is, most of these car are winners. :surprise: "
carnaught,September 2011," something else that needs to be considered with the tl are its controversial looks which most do not like and the fact that, at least with my, and many others experience, they develop numerous squeaks and rattles and the interior seat show wear prematurely. maybe this latest tl iteration is improved with regard to those issues, however. "
fedlawman,September 2011," ""the most dtoyotaurbing part is 20 years has gone by since 1991""the e36 came out in 1991. the beginning of the end...  "
markcincinnati,September 2011," the tl i was referring to is the 2012 which underwent a nose ectomy, a butt ectomy the addition of a bunch of sound deadening and a delightful 6 speed auto. it is, now, better looking -- not an audi mind you -- but better looking without the beak.i am, at this point, unable to comment on squeaks and rattles and premature seat wear. are your comments based on personal experience? a couple of people at my office have acura and their primary comment about the car is ""they are incredibly durable."" also, at this point, the retained value of the tl is among the highest of any vehicle -- hence its terrific lease progdodges. i got mine which ltoyotaed for $47+k with one accessory, back up sensors, for $499 per month for 36 months plus tax.if money were no object, i would get an audi s4 prestige with the sport diff (torque vectoring). since money is an object, well, i went with the acura which seemed like a very high value.ill let you know if things start rattling and wear out prematurely. "
nyccarguy,September 2011," mark - thanks for the in depth, detailed write up. congrats on your new tl! enjoy it for the next 3 years until you get your next audi.fedlawman - if it wasnt for the e36, i might have never fallen in love with bmw. the 1st bmw i ever drove was a close friends 1995 e36 325is with 5-speed stick, sport package, & he told me he was able to get it lowered further from the factory (individual?). it made me feel like superman behind the wheel. "
fedlawman,September 2011," ah, first love! i understand. my first bmw drive was my uncles e30 325i. plastic seat and 5-speed stick. love at first drive.i very much like certain things about the e36 too. i love the vanos i-6 - it is so smooth and sweet sounding. and the toyota and amenities are a big step up from the e30.and for the record, i think the tl is highly underrated on this forum. it may not be the best at anything, but it does so many things so very well. "
plekto,September 2011," yes, the e36 is somewhat acceptable as well, since with some tweaking, it can be pushed back to 3000lbs. add some more modern rutoyotaer and a few tweaks like beefier calipers and so on and its pretty nice.what we have now is symptomatic of the bloat-until-it-assumes-the-previous-one-size-larger-models-place progression that seems to infect all of the makers now. this is also identical to what was happening in the 70s. bigger and bigger and oh my word thats a huge car all of a sudden...the 1 series is kind of like a e26 v 2.0 in its weight and size. its what i would consider a sports sedan, if a bit on the heavy side. but what we have now as the current crop of car are really big bloated grocery hauling machines that just are called ""sporty"" because they are the smallest whales in the pod and happen to have shiny rims and big wheels attached.that toyota, the acura simply doesnt belong as its just a plain vanilla ""honda"" to the rest of the world. over here, they slap acura badges on it and raise the price. its front wheel drive, has a plain vanilla 4 cylinder engine, and the handling is, well, standard family car. its a nice car, but its not proper luxury or proper sports. "
ivan_99,September 2011," and for the record, i think the tl is highly underrated on this forum. it may not be the best at anything, but it does so many things so very well.agreed...i liked the old beak (think im the only one  )...it had flare.plus i got the sh-awd to over-steer...so it could be persuaded to have fun too. "
billyperksii,September 2011," mark- a man after my own heart, congrats on your excellent choice in value, style and performance.i have the 2009 with the beak and butt, 25 months later and 13k miles-zero squeekes, zero seat wear and all compliments.my salesman keeps sending me emails in regards to a swap for the 2012-no thanks, the 2012 imho is too soft-appearance wise. "
m6user,September 2011," has anyone noticed that people are actually bigger now than they were twenty years ago? look at high school football teams. my god they are huge. i think carmakers have responded to some degree. granted many people are heavier than they should be but the actual fdodgees of each subsequent generation is larger than the previous. add in all the safety crash protection in the fdodgees, larger brakes, airbags, sunroofs, power everything and it makes for more size and weight in car. some may not hear it but weight isnt the only thing that matters in a car drivablilty. "
cdnpinhead,September 2011," since money is an object, well, i went with the acura which seemed like a very high value.welcome aboard! ive been driving a acura for 3.5 years and enjoy it quite a lot, except for the pair of wheels doing the propulsion. mine is a pre-beak edition with a manual transmission; dont much care for the styling after the 08s. the original concept was to drive this 3-4 years, then trade it for the diesel acura, but mostly due to ca pollution regs, it didnt come to pass.you came close to getting that bmw(or was it 45?) a few years ago; im stunned that you actually pulled the trigger this time. hope youre pleased with it. i lack the ""princess & the pea"" sensitivity to many things that those who populate this board (or who did before it went dead) possess, but havent noticed any issues with rattles or wear on the leather. "
flightnurse,September 2011," not too sure of i follow your logic on the infiniti, just because it was smaller doesnt mean its not a sport sedan. i would think the infiniti has more interior space then the audi. i looked at the audi (mid level) i like it but thought the infiniti was bigger. "
ivan_99,September 2011,  look at high school football teamseven younger...as my trim 90 lbs 8 year old leaves bodies in his wake...just an opening for dad to brag  
andres3,September 2011," because almost every car these days can be had with leather and nav, and so you have to look further and be a bit more discerning in what exactly ""luxury"" means aside from leather and a high price tag. not all leathers and nav systems were created equal. you can have grade a leather, grade b, grade c, grade d, grade f. the way it is put together, installed, and assmebled can vary in quality as well as the material itself.i thought the infiniti i looked at in 2009 were very nice inside. "
flightnurse,September 2011," the tl is a great car to commute in, but if you are looking for a car with soul, the acrua line (except for the honda) is a company to avoid. the tl really doesnt have much competition since its front wheel drive it isnt taken are seriously as a sport sedan as the bmw. audi handle well in audi form but not so well in fwd version. "
billyperksii,September 2011," he did not say the g was not a sports sedan- he simply toyota the interior was too small for his liking. i felt the same way too when i test drove it, the size and the intrusive engine noise made me gave keys back to the salesman in a twinkle of the eye. "
plekto,September 2011," and then you test drove the c class or a bmw. huge difference. quiet, refined, and what you want in terms of proper luxury. the main reason acura, infiniti, and lexus all come off as trying too hard and a bit plain vanilla is because in japan, they dont really extoyota. there is honda. period. there is nissan. end of choices. toyota just recently stsrted selling lexus over there, but for almost two decades, it was simply another model of toyota.mercedes, they make luxury car and thats it aside from a few military vehicles and their commercial truck line. its not a standard vehicle thats been tweaked and had a lot of bling added. its the real deal. bmw is the same. and audi, though they are a lot like volkswagen in some ways, has always been its own company and own engineering. a lot like say, cadillac - there has been some overlap from time to time with the lower end models, but its always been its own company/line. acura does nothing for me. in fact, volvo makes better car these days. (very nice, in fact, and off of most peoples radar here) infiniti has their highest-end large car, which is good, and proper luxury, but its also huge and basically like a big lexus in how it drives. and, lastly, lexus. very nice, but still so devoid of soul and personality that it screams ""safe vanilla choice"". "
fedlawman,September 2011," ""that toyota, the acura simply doesnt belong as its just a plain vanilla ""honda"" to the rest of the world. over here, they slap acura badges on it and raise the price. its front wheel drive, has a plain vanilla 4 cylinder engine, and the handling is, well, standard family car. its a nice car, but its not proper luxury or proper sports.""the american honda is creamy vanilla. the honda of the ""rest of the world"" (our acura) is far from it. your comments make it obvious that you have never actually driven a acura infiniti at speed.around town during a test drive, yes, it might resemble a smaller tighter honda at first glance, but on a racetrack, there is no comparison. take it from someone who knows first hand, the acura is a responsive, toyotamic, fun-to-drive sport sedan. period. "
smarty666,September 2011," you do realize that vehicles from the bmw below and mercedes below are not even considered luxury over in europe? i suppose not. hate to break it to you, caddy has never been it own company/line. it has and always will be a luxury division/line of a larger company, just like acura, lexus, infiniti, and audi are. i do agree with your comments about lexus though being a ""safe vanilla choice"". mercedes mercedes is another ""safe vanilla choice"" and neither lexus nor mb has ever done anything to knock my socks off. they both are devoid of soul and fun.but infiniti is no way a safe vanilla choice by any stretch of the imagination. that just goes to show you really need to test drive the vehicles you put down. it is quite sad that you limit yourself to the overpriced, poorer reliability of bmw and mb as your only options as true luxury vehicles. "
nyccarguy,September 2011," i agree with you 100% fedlawman. even though my 2010 acura is equipped with an automatic, it is the best automatic ive ever driven. it holds shifts in m(anual) mode until i (the driver) flicks the paddle on the right for it to upshift. even in s(port) mode, as long as my foot is planted, the revs will keep climbing to the redline before the transmission upshifts.ive heard the acura with a 6-speed stick is an absolute blast to drive. weve already got one car in our fleet that my wife cannot drive (my 2001 honda honda type sh). when we bought the acura, it was supposed to be her car (replacing our dearly loved 2007 bmw x3). since we found out child #3 is on her way, we bought my wife a honda & i inherited the acura.is my acura perfect? no. like our resident 1st generation acura owner says ""the wrong wheels are driving the car."". i dont like the electric power steering.those who say it is ""just a rebadged honda"" need to drive the 2 car back to back. "
nyccarguy,September 2011," back in 2009 i drove an honda honda w/ nav & a acura w/ tech pkg. both had almost identical sticker prices. while the honda v6 had ""more punch,"" the acura i4 was much smoother. the suspension is tuned much more taut in the acura. the acura has stiffer anti-roll bars. it is definitely a car you have to drive to appreciate. im not saying the tl isnt more of a drivers car with its 305 hp v6 & sh awd. its price of admission is significantly higher than the acura. it also didnt meet the gas mileage requirements of the cash 4 clunkers progdodge.for the record, i dig ""the beak."" "
sweendogy,September 2011," ""infiniti has their highest-end large car, which is good, and proper luxury, but its also huge and basically like a big lexus in how it drives.""dude youve never driven a bmw, bmw0 or the bmw hybrid with that statement- or maybe youve never driven the big lexus-- which i guess your talking about the ls. totally different car- you should try them. ""the main reason acura, infiniti, and lexus all come off as trying too hard and a bit plain vanilla is because in japan, they dont really extoyota."" trying to hard?? what are you saying here?? hello- all 3 of these brands have been around for 20 years.. they have sold millions of car and have huge amounts of brand cred across the world. "
plekto,September 2011," you do realize that vehicles from the bmw below and mercedes below are not even considered luxury over in europe?absolutely. whats amazing is that we consider an honda with a fancy badge on it and some upgraded suspension parts to be luxury over here. now, to be fair, a lot of that is because they are a bit hondad over there, but youd figure that the minimum standard would at least be something like a 5 series or similar in the u.s. not re-badged honda and buick and the like.perhaps weve been driving crap for so long over here that we now consider above average to be fantastic. the acura might be great to a lot of people, but they are simply unaware. to consider it a ""luxury sport sedan"", well it fails on both accounts. front wheel drive, underpowered for its weight unless you get the v6, dead steering feel, and, well, the ltoyota goes on and on. if you consider it to be awesome luxury, well, more power to you. as for trying to find a ""luxury sport sedan"", well, my take on it is that nobody makes one any more. they now all make large luxury car with a sporty suspension and needlessly large tires to compensate.heres a challenge:find me a car with 2 or 4 doors. if 2 doors, it must have a usable back seat. no, the 911 does not qualify, obviously.it must be rear wheel drive.it must be under 3000lbs.it must be sporty. not rims and some spoiler but really upgraded.and thats before we add the luxury requirement to the mix. can anyone here find one? really. maybe i forgot some vehicle or something? everything i find is front wheel drive or hundreds of pounds heavier. even raising the weight to 3200lbs adds a mere handful of choices in the first category. (since the e36 was 3200 lbs, this is as heavy as id consider)**** "
fedlawman,September 2011," you do realize that this is the ""entry-level"" luxury sport sedan forum, right?there is a difference between luxury and near-luxury. all of these car walk the line. "
mortienne,September 2011," ""hello- all 3 of these brands have been around for 20 years.. they have sold millions of car and have huge amounts of brand cred across the world.""id take issue with this, at least as far as europe is concerned. yes, lexus has been around for a long time, but infiniti as a brand is a very recent arrival. is acura even present there? my honda i drove when i lived in the uk was badged as a honda, not an acura, and didnt suffer one iota because of it. "
ivan_99,September 2011," heres a challenge:... not sure youd ever find anything in the ""entry level luxury performance sedan"" with those qualifications.the luxury...and the sedan part usually push it over 3000lbs...but...audi tt (not a sedan...not really rwd...but probably just as good...over 3000 lbs...by a little).ummm...how about a 911  hey...for under $40k you can pick up a nice 05-06. "
carnaught,September 2011," i am, at this point, unable to comment on squeaks and rattles and premature seat wear. are your comments based on personal experience?yes, ive owned two. they were reliable, however  . "
2233,September 2011, i believe that the lexus brand and the infiniti brand were created the same year.infiniti was known then for producing ads that did not show the vehicles. 
mortienne,September 2011," ""i believe that the lexus brand and the infiniti brand were created the same year. ""which wasnt the point under discussion. it was whether those brands were known world-wide. lexus were active in europe pretty much from launch. infiniti was conceived as more of a us brand. infiniti car werent sold officially in europe until 2008. when i left the uk in 2002, car that were labelled acura in the us were sold with a honda badge in europe. "
m6user,September 2011," are the honda sold in europe the exact same car as the acura sold here in the us? when i say exact i dont mean safety because there are obvious differences due to those regulations, but are they the same level of, for want of a better word, luxury. if so, what kind of prices are these car being sold for in europe? maybe the honda as we know it here wouldnt even sell in europe because they would be too low rent so to speak. "
billyperksii,September 2011," we play football here-does the rest of the world care?who cares what our luxury models are badged as in europe?a guy driving around in a 5 series here might get pontiacd at by european tourtoyota thinking its a cab-big deal, culture clash.we live here, lets keep our ford here. "
smarty666,September 2011," of course its a challenge, because the criteria you place on a sports sedan is absurd. i never toyota the acura is a sport sedan but the infiniti and bmw most certainly are. you will find few people who will argue otherwise. i didnt realize that the 1mazdanch and 17inch wheels offered oem are needlessly large tires? i suppose some 14 inch ones would be better :p the problem is, you and many others place too much emphasis on what the rest of the world is doing in the car market. who cares what is and what is not offered in japan, or germany, china, korea, etc. who cares that lexus, or infiniti, and acura are not everywhere around the globe. what matters is they are here and have been for some time now. all that matters is what we are offered here and what we get to choose from. in my life, i have had plenty of mainhonda division car and luxury division vehicles, trust me, there is a big difference between the two. unfortunately, people such as yourself, go in at bat with the mindset that they are just rebadged junk and not worth the money, but there is more than just the name and price. it is nicer materials, better put together body, longer warranty, better dealership experience, etc and some other perks you get at the luxury companies than the mainhonda. ive seen it first hand from many different makes, both american, german, and japanese. "
m6user,September 2011," we live here, lets keep our ford here.i was just curious because i hear so often that many of our luxury brands are just glamorized non-luxury models in other parts of the world. i really wonder if they are that close or are the car we get here really substantially upgraded when the acura name goes on for example. if you dont want to answer the question just dont answer it. nobody appointed you hall monitor. "
plekto,September 2011," why is even finding a 3200lb rwd sedan these days so unreasonable? its not a problem, because in *europe*, such vehicles do extoyota. but we get the jumbo economy sized pigs in the u.s.3600lbs for a 3 series is criminal.when a previous generation nissan came in at 3000lbs, and it wasnt a tiny car, somethings gone horribly wrong. its not unreasonable to expect lightweight and sporty. the maxda mazda is (now was - hope the replacement isnt 3500lbs and fwd) 3000lbs. it gets it right. i actually did find a one car that fit my ltoyota. at least for a sport sedan. (yes, it has 4 doors, though their choice of having the rear two open backwards was questionable) why is a infiniti 500 lbs heavier than a mazda? surely the engineers arent itt tech drop-outs. also, from a handling perspective, larger tires will create more lateral grip so that we get better testing scores, but if the car is lighter, it can do just as well with even 15 inch tires. compare an e30 to todays nonsense. much smaller suspension parts, smaller tires, smaller brake calipers, and yet it runs much better than the current model in actual driving because you dont have to manhandle the thing and hear the tires howling to get good speed down a twtoyotay road. "
shipo,September 2011," ""3600lbs for a 3 series is criminal.""the 2011 bmw bmw tips the scales at 3,362 pounds which is about 165 pounds heavier than my 1999 bmw. not exactly a lightweight, but not 3,600 pounds either. "
plekto,September 2011, and how much does the bmw weigh? how much does the c 300 weigh? car are horrendously heavy today. 
billyperksii,September 2011, i appointed myself. 
fedlawman,September 2011," ""why is even finding a 3200lb rwd sedan these days so unreasonable? its not a problem, because in *europe*, such vehicles do extoyota.""i cant think of a single car that is available in europe but not here that fits this description... "
markcincinnati,September 2011," while not the uninissanl answer to the many complaints about the weight of these car we go on about, i suspect there is some justification for the piling on of pounds these machines have endured over the years.among the reasons are the addition of more and more safety devices, electronic nannies (most of which i love), increased sound deadening, more content (which may be luxury content, increased unsprung weight (from ever larger and heavier wheels and tires, etc.)), larger engines, more gears in the transmission (although sometimes there are weight savings with some of the new transmissions. . .sometimes), widespread adoption or availability of awd, more plush (and heavier) interiors, etc. simultaneously, i assume the mfgrs are attempting to shave every ounce or pound they can with the use of lighter materials where ever possible and cost effective.as pogo says ""we have met the enemy and he is us."" we want more luxury features, we want more powerful engines, we want the sportiness. and stickiness of awd, we want our car to be quieter and we want the big shiny wheels -- 18-inchers are for sissies, we need 19s, 20s or even bigger (and heavier) ones. we want tires that have side-walls that are super-stiff (hence heavier tires) and we want every possible power amenity: power seat massagers and ventilated seat even. hell i dont want these things, i need them! doesnt everybody?i suppose abs and esp and brake asstoyota weigh something -- but gawd, why have a car without that stuff (and i certainly want the other drivers to have these features, since they --- not me -- have become such dreadful drivers over the years.)so were ""stuck"" with ever heavier car -- because we want them, are required by law to have them and are, apparently, willing to pay for them.frankly, virtually any of the following: acura tl advance, audi audi prestige/sport (or s-line), bmw bmw bmw, cadillac cts/4 3.6 performance/luxury, infiniti infiniti/s or volvo volvo t6 would be welcome in my garage -- the fact that after 29 audi in a row i bought a tl was simply that the damn thing came in nearly $200 less per month than the car i wanted, a 2011 audi audi prestige/sport. that and the 19"" wheels and tires and a very sweet and smooth 305hp engine. oh yea, and an even better sound system than the b&o system found in the audi (and that is saying something.)i may find, as some suggest here, that the acura will ultimately prove to be unexciting, uninspiring and prone to rattles and premature leather wear (on the seat). residual values suggest otherwise, but i dont even have 1,000 miles on the acura yet, so i am not a reliable or experienced witness.anyway, kwitcherbitchin, the car are heavy, heavier, heaviest mostly because we want them that way (or at least most of us do.) :surprise: "
Kirstie_H,September 2011," fortunately, im available to take over.as long as the connissantion is on-topic (which it is), members are free to discuss anything within the realm of ellps, even if the sedan extoyota only in europe or madagascar, for that matter. "
shipo,September 2011," like it or dont, if you want a car with in excess of 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque, youll also need to buy a car with a heavier engine and drive-train. throw just the engine from the bmw into a bmw (a process which will bump the weight in and of itself), and just watch what happens to the rest of the drive-train. not pretty.as has been stated here before, between the regulated in safety features and the market demand for larger and more powerful car, it is physically impossible to build a relatively inexpensive sedan with the size, safety and performance of a bmw for anywhere near 3,200 pounds. "
nyccarguy,September 2011, amen to what mark & shipo just toyota! 
nyccarguy,September 2011," the goal of every single car manufacturer in the entire world is to sell car! if we all ""did the smart thing"" by paying cash for our camcord & driving them for 10 - 15 years until the wheels fell off, then luxury car wouldnt extoyota. performance car wouldnt extoyota.people have the mindset of: ""im paying $40,000 ($50,000) for a car and it better have...""car companies make a lot of money off people who lease or get new car every 3-5 years. they spend many millions of dollars on advertising and marketing so you make sure you know about ""the latest & greatest"" out there. if you were a ""serial leasee"" and were driving a bmw. when your lease is up and your bmw is still exactly the same, are you going to lease another bmw or try something different.forget the fact that you are an enthusiast (we are a drop in the bucket). if you were looking at one of these ellps today and everything else were equal except bmw offering was still the e36 bmw as it left us in 1998 (i know the e36 coupes stuck around until 1999) would you buy it?todays e90 3 series is miniature enough as it is. trunk space is laughable. imagine if we were talking about an e36, 2 generations ago.the government (& the people) want more safety features. people want higher performance. people want more technology. people want car that can carry 4 people toyotaably. people want car with generous sized trunks. the car companies are just making what the people want. "
smarty666,September 2011," you illustrated my point and others nicely. lets go and talk about another country where the car market is completely different and where all of us shop for vehicles, over in europe, :sick: "
fedlawman,September 2011," where everyone lives in a castle, the taxicabs are s65 amgs, and there are no speed limits.  "
plekto,September 2011," todays e90 3 series is miniature enough as it is. trunk space is laughable. imagine if we were talking about an e36, 2 generations ago.the government (& the people) want more safety features. people want higher performance. people want more technology. people want car that can carry 4 people toyotaably. people want car with generous sized trunks. and they were doing the same nonsense in the 70s, when car got heavier every year. people want more and more, and that just leaves us with a grocery getter and something that is more of a plush luxury sedan rather than anything that resembles true sportiness.to be honest, the trunk space on a e36 is more usable than todays car. squarer body means a better layout if were talking about grocery bags and the like. the epa rated it at 86/10 the current model is 93/12. but its rounded and the opening is terribly short length-wise.lastly, the mazda and the previous nissan both where 3000lbs. large car can be light. sporty car can also be light - and the mazda is almost as good as a bmw on a track. theres simply no reason to not make car lighter, because from a technical standpoint, they can be lighter if its a priority. "
shipo,September 2011," ""lastly, the mazda and the previous nissan both where 3000lbs. large car can be light. sporty car can also be light - and the mazda is almost as good as a bmw on a track. theres simply no reason to not make car lighter, because from a technical standpoint, they can be lighter if its a priority.""the mazda is an aberration and shouldnt be used in the context of this discussion. why? because a) it has been out of production for nearly a year now,  while the mazda may compete on a track with say a bmw, it has far less usable room, drinks more than half again as much fuel for any given dtoyotaance at any given level of performance, and c) the engine is extremely difficult to clean up from a pollution perspective (one of the biggest reasons why it is no longer in production).the nissan? seriously? i thought this discussion was about rwd sedan. if you throw fwd into the mix then yes, packaging efficiency and a compact drive-train can be combined to reduce weight; but at a cost (fwd being that cost). "
flightnurse,September 2011," the main reason why the mazda is out of production was the engine was not effient enough, it past emissions with no problem, but it loved oil, a quart in every 4k miles. also i would put a 328 again the mazda, i would place the 128 again it or 135. "
shipo,September 2011," per a press release i read from mazda last year, their biggest challenge (and subsequent reason for cancelling the mazda) with the (then) current generation of rotary engines was meeting upcoming emissions standards; especially so in europe.in this case im only the messenger. "
m6user,September 2011, i thought this discussion was about rwd sedani dont see rwd in the discussion title. if you mean that only rwd can be performance car than that rules out the tl and the audi unless you get the awd. but then its not rwd is it. also eliminates the acura which many on here dont think qualifies but i think it fits in as an entry level luxury performance sedan. youre right about the mazda or nissan. they are not premium brands but have some nice offerings. 
graphicguy,September 2011," mark...gratz on the new tl. they are mighty fine car. plus, the sh awd version you have is much closer to an audi s4 that audi cares to admit.looking back, acura and bmw are probably my two favorite brands....ive owned 3 tls and 3-3 series, which is more than any other brand/model.like you, ive driven lexus, infiniti, mbs, caddy. the comparable acura and bmw always wins out over them.where did you buy yours.....superior or columbia? "
shipo,September 2011," maybe im confusing threads, but if i recall correctly, the discussion about how heavy car have gotten included a reference to rwd sedan. while im personally biased toward rwd vehicles, i dont use my bias to exclude other drive layouts from the ellps segment. "
markcincinnati,September 2011," thanks for the congrats -- here is the buying story.i found a website called carwoo.com -- which, for a one time fee, allows you to locate and price a car without revealing your identity. unlike competing web sites that do essentially the same thing, carwoo takes money only from the buyer, not from the seller (unless, of course they are lying.) i paid $148 which allowed me to send queries to every audi, acura, infiniti and volovo dealer in ohio, kentucky and indiana. i limited my selection to the dealers under 200 miles away from cincinnati.carwoo allows you to configure the car exactly as you want it and you get a text box to explain any flexibility you may have or anything you will not consider.you then press a button and wait about 24 hours for the carwoo email machine to start sending you links to your carwoo account with offers from dealers.to make a long story a bit shorter, volvo responded quickly and would not budge off of a $1,000 off msrp discount. bzzz! thanks for playing, maybe next time.infiniti was pretty aggressive and two dealers offered me prices that almost had me saying yes.audi dealers responded, oddly, (all of them) saying they had no inventory and that any audi would have to be ordered. one of them finally gave me a price but it was for 42 months, not 36 or 39 and it began with a $7 (for a sub $48,000 audi for pitys sake).acura, locally, came in at best, with a 6.5% discount off msrp (columbia). a columbus ohio dealer -- lindsay acura -- came in at 13% off msrp for a 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance with backup sensors (which are about a $715 accessory.) heres the funny thing, they sourced the car from columbia -- i have the window sticker! whatsupwiththat?!?the car was $499 per month + tax.i had driven all of the car (not a lexus or mb of any kind) multiple multiple times and really liked the audi (whats not to like i still have my 2009 for another 30 days?), the bmwx and the tl sh-awd (advance model). likewise i thought the volvo volvo t6 was great fun! i also had a chance to drive a premium+ audi s4 (without the sport diff -- aka no torque vectoring.) now that car was the most fun of all (but in premium+ mode had much less ""content"" than the other car i had tested, plus is was mo money, big time.)truth be told in what was nearly a back to back to back experience, i drove the audi, the cadillac and the acura over the exact same route for about the exact same time, speeds, tunes on the sound system, etc, etc, in one days worth of test drives.i am hoping not to receive a bunch of ""are you out of your mind"" posts, but i will toyota to say this -- the acura tl sh-awd advance is very close in performance and overall ""character"" to an audi s4 -- and although very nice and perhaps ""dressier,"" the cadillac cts/4 3.6 with the 19"" wheel performance option was the least inspiring of the bunch.now the acura tl sh-awd advance is no audi s4, i am not saying it is, the s4 would be the winner, but contented to match the acura was just shy of $12,000 more and i could not muster the one that i drove (which was not contented thusly) into and out of corners that much quicker than i could the acura (which may have had an advantage over the audi at the time since the acura had torque vectoring and the the audi did not. moreover, the audi did seem more prone to wallowing through corners as if it had more understeer than the acura, which, even though it was slower seemed perhaps better balanced than the audi.so, i says to myself, the acura (as equipped to my tastes) was just under $48,000 (including shipping, but excluding tax), and my price was about $8,000 off of that -- thank you carwoo.com.no one else even came close.remember i was pricing an audi 2.0t prestige 8-spd tip w/sport package and wood which came in pretty close msrp wise to the acura. the cadillac had attractive offers but other than its glizt left me thinking it was not forded on performance as much as the other guys. and, the cadillac had one thing missing that, for me, was a deal breaker -- a $53,000 cts does not have grab handles for the front seat passenger or driver. all the other guys do -- and i consider them essential, basic, standard, normal and required. how much do grab handles cost anyway -- in a $53,000 car, maybe $50? what were they thinking? and, moreover, cadillac in the 4-door cts does not even offer a blind spot warning system -- which came standard on both the audi and the acura at the trim levels i specd.so, thus far, i am missing the audi new car smell, i miss automatic windshield wipers and bi-xenons (but i rarely can turn on my high beams, so that is not that big of a deal) -- and, oddly enough, i miss the audi needle sweep when i start the acura up.then, i get on the highway and press my foot down, arousing a 305hp 274 pound feet of torque super smooth engine, watch the power shift from the front to the rear wheels and, zip, im at 80mph in a dtoyotaance that seems not much longer than my driveway.loving the cooled seat and the best sound system i have ever heard in any car (including the b&o in audi which had been my previous fave.)having toyota all of this -- i probably still would have gone with the audi 2.0t prestige sport if it had come in at a price to match the acura.money talks, as the saying goes. . . :surprise: "
nyccarguy,September 2011," yes the mazda is light, balanced,rwd, & nimble. like shipo says, at costs. the engines torque peaks at a very lofty rpm and my dads 2010 chevrolet chevrolet gets better gas mileage. before you quote me epa sticker numbers, find out what the real world mpg is on an mazda. "
nyccarguy,September 2011, great deal & a great write up on a fantastic car. 
graphicguy,September 2011," mark...cool! as nyc toyota, great write-up.im mazdar with both columbia and hidy. funny that hidy was trying to sell a car that was on columbias lot.interesting about carwoo, also. personally, i dont care if dealers know my identity. but, i can see where if you didnt want to be bothered with having them contact you where it might be useful.anyway, that tl is a very nice ride. youll like it during the time you have it parked in your driveway.funny about audi. when i was looking several months ago, s4s were on my shopping ltoyota. the cincinnati dealer told me they had such limited stock of everything because the factory wasnt shipping them as many car. that included their volume model the audi. they had one s4, but it wasnt even close to what i was looking for, and it was a demo.the audi store in dayton had one, but it was a 2k mi trade-in (wonder how much of a bath that owner took) who wanted the (then new) audi instead.beechmont had the best selection with 4 s4s at the time. but, like you, i couldnt see where the price delta was worth it to pay that much more over the similar tl sh awd.bmw is offering to do a factory performance retrofit on my bmw, which would up both the hp and the torque by about 7%. understand, i believe that bmw is stretching the truth about how much hp and torque the bmw motor is putting out in factory trim (its a lot more). the kicker, i can do the facotry performance upgrade at my dealership, complete with normal bmw warranty for $600. im debating if ill want it. my car already as fast as greased lightening, how much more could i want? but, were talking 20 extra ponies here.

graphicguy,September 2011," mark....sorry about that. seems ive talked to, or visited every acura and bmw dealer within a 100 mile radius of cincinnati in the last couple of years. they start to run together.im mazdar with lindsay, too. while, ive not visited the store, i had dealt with one of the sales people there, who wasnt very good. i was looking for a particular color combo. he toyota he had it. when i asked him for the vin#, he strung me along, wanting me to come to the store to ""talk about the car"". i wanted to make sure they had the color combo before making a 90 minute drive. i told him all it would take for me to drive up to visit him was the vin so i could confirm he had what i wanted. he couldnt/wouldnt he wouldnt assure me of that.again, congrats on the car. its a very nice one that youre going to enjoy a lot.kyfdx.....heres the blurb on edmunds (which my dealer confirms they can do).....http://www.insideline.com/bmw/1-series/bmw-offers-performance-power-kit-for-135i- -and-bmw.htmli know the previous 135/335 had the twin turbo (n54), and the new ones have the twin scroll turbo (n55). ive driven both. the n54 had a bit of turbo lag (not much). but, bmw overboosts it at higher rpm (which is why the bmw is rated with more hp and torque than the n55. however, i think both motors are under rated and put out more hp and torque than bmw says they do.that toyota, im trying to decide if i want the extra hp/torque. that would essentially make my bmw coupe with the same engine performance as the bmw, which is mighty good.but, mine is really good to begin with. im debating but probably will do it when i can schedule some time at the dealership to get it done. who doesnt like more hp and torque? :shades: hows your new z4, btw? did you ever post pics? "
plekto,September 2011," maybe im confusing threads, but if i recall correctly, the discussion about how heavy car have gotten included a reference to rwd sedan. while im personally biased toward rwd vehicles, i dont use my bias to exclude other drive layouts from the ellps segment. i didnt exclude fwd or awd car, its just that bmw earlier models set the standard for the class, which led to the best example, the e30. (also volvo did make a 240 turbo which was nearly identical at the time). that both were rwd was just because thats how they liked to make car.but as far as weight, 3500+ lbs isnt sporty. not when you add in fuel, fluids, a battery, and normal stuff like a spare tire, which arent part of the ""dry weight"" ltoyotaed. that adds another 200-300 lbs or so, conservatively. then add in a typical driver, and you can be at or near 4000lbs rolling down the road. physics dictate that you cannot get a 2 ton anything to turn on a dime and actually be nimble.now, compared by decades of sofa on wheels, yes, they could be described as ""sporty."" but theyre a far, far cry from their original roots.oh, i thought of another possible small sport sedan to add to the under 3000lbs ltoyota - the mini cooper s. in fact, this is a perfect example, because on paper the turning radius is actually worse than a bmw. (vs 35.1 vs 36.2 ft) but drive one and its a huge difference in how they actually move and handle. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf4ywkwjlikhere is the bmw vs the cooper. of note is the huge difference in slalom speeds. weight is a huge problem that even better tires and rwd cant completely mitigate. in something like a acura, well, the slalom speed for a acura is 64.6 mph (both edmunds, same exact testing methods) the original e36 bmw? edmunds managed to get one to go 75mph through their slalom. just a whole other planet compared to todays car. "

sweendogy,September 2011," congrats on the tl- as a pedestrian im happy that acura cleaned up the look a bit for 2012. living in new england i see very few (08?)09-11 versions then one would expect.. audi, bmw, infiniti along with acura are way more common-- my guess it has to do with looks along with the acura being a good cheaper option. does anyone know when acura will do a revamp of the current lineup?i will check out your advertisement for car woo, thanks. "
kyfdx,September 2011," hows your new z4, btw? did you ever post pics? nope... no pics...the car is fine, the wife doesnt like it, and i have a friend who is going to take over the lease, next sunday. ill have had the car for one month, total... lol "
fedlawman,September 2011, but it was designed by women (for women?).what doesnt she like about it? what are you going to replace it with? 
graphicguy,September 2011," kyfdx.....well....give the girl what she wants, then.i know you hunted high and low for that car, even driving out east to get it.thats a shame. i have a friend (female) who has a z3.....an 03. she loves it.....says its the best car shes ever owned.i think you now take the crown as having the shortest ownership experience of anyone i know.you just beat the now 2nd shortest ownership experience i became aware of (my best friend and his chevrolet) by 3 months.so, whats next on the agenda? "
kyfdx,September 2011," the ""designed for women"" thing? you should drive one... i think youd be impressed..anyway, i got it to replace her x3, which comes off lease in october... turns out, she didnt really want a z4, she wanted another suv.. somehow, that fact just slipped right on by me... :surprise: anyway, she loves the new x3, but its an easy $250/mo. more than her current lease, which puts it way over budget... in fact, just about all compact suvs have lousy lease deals. so, that, coupled with her now working from home (a lot less miles driven) is leading us to possibly purchase a vehicle... top candidates are:volvo volvoaudi audi volkswagenbut, we just acquired an e30, so she can drive my sons acura, after her lease is up.... for a month or so... if we havent found a replacement by the end of october.. so, im not pressed for time...regards,kyfdx "
fedlawman,September 2011," if shes anything like my wife, once she got a taste of sitting up high, she wont go easily back to sedan/coupes.my wife loves our volvo v70, but she still talks about how she misses the buick rendezvous we had. our next car will probably be one of the ones on your ltoyota too - with the possible addition of the land rover lr4.although...she carpooled to work the other day and the driver had a new subaru subaru. when she got home from work, i heard all about how nice it was. out of curiosity, i test drove one last week and was very impressed. "
ivan_99,September 2011," but as far as weight, 3500+ lbs isnt sporty. not when you add in fuel, fluids, a battery, and normal stuff like a spare tire, which arent part of the ""dry weight"" ltoyotaed. that adds another 200-300 lbs or so, conservatively.ive never seen ""dry weight"" ltoyotaed (unless its a motorcycle)...ive only seen curb weight which includes all the fluids topped up.where have you seen ""dry weight"" ltoyotaed?

flightnurse,September 2011, your obsession with the e30 has gone over board. the mazda is a better handler then a e30 could be. i would rather have my bmw then your e30. market dictates what gets sold and people want luxury inside their car.

rayainsw,September 2011, congratulations on the new car - and best of luck!- raydid not drive one of those - for several reasons... 
markcincinnati,September 2011," tell us about the delivery routine. how were you treated, etc. involve us.btw -- congratulations! "
plekto,September 2011," some models ltoyota weight (almost certainly dry weight) and some ""curb weight"". you also have to add in supplies and so on (chains, battery cables, maps, etc). some car dont include the spare tire in the weight as well, as its optional. "
rayainsw,September 2011," i will - but likely not until sometime this weekend.- raybusy, tired & jet-lagged... "
graphicguy,September 2011," mark....fact is, regardless of more weight (these car dont weigh near what the ones ive seen from the 60s-70s weigh), your tl will outperform any tl that came before it. same goes for most models.ray...congrats on the new car. would also love to hear about the delivery. "
markcincinnati,September 2011," i am pretty well convinced that my 2012 tl will outperform my 2009 audi 2.0t, too. the audi, which has audi drive select, can be put into ""toyotamic"" mode and that makes the steering more responsive and the dampers more firm and the transmission shift at higher speeds. it has 19"" wheels with ultra high performance yoko s.advan (?) all-season tires (35% aspect ratio).it has rear wheel drive biased audi and last but not least has 211hp and 258 lb ft of torque with the power going through a 6 speed automatic ""tiptronic"" transmission.it, the audi that is, is and has been great fun to drive and it is confidence inspiring to the max.the tl isnt quite as hunkered down feeling, but it is wider and has about a 1"" shorter wheelbase. it is nose heavier than the audi (but not a whole lot), rides on similar tires (but not ultra high performance) of 40% aspect ratio is front biased awd, but also includes torque vectoring. it feels a bit softer than the audi, it is quieter and feels a bit larger -- but it has 305hp and 274 lb feet of torque, and when properly applied when cornering, the damn thing seems to be able to magically go from a nose heavy understeering blob, to an oversteering (slightly) taught, tight curve carver.the audi probably can cut the corners about at the same speeds, or maybe higher than the acura, even without torque vectoring -- but when coming out of the curve the 305hp allows the acura to always show the audi its tail lights. my audi, all in, was $49k (msrp) the acura, just south of $48k -- at these prices power rules. and, overall the acura is a very nice place to spend some time either behind the wheel or as a passenger enjoying the ventilated seat (that the audi lacks).toyota it before, irrational as it might be, if the audi were the same lease price per month as the acura (that is about $200 less), i would have gone with another audi -- just for that special something that only a german car seems to offer.irrational.couldnt see the price per month delta though and that seems rational. i am overall quite pleased with the acura and if they continue to improve and move forward and keep their value prop, well, i could become a true believer. you know, though, any of these car are pretty damn nice. :surprise: "
graphicguy,September 2011," you know, though, any of these car are pretty damn nice. that....we absolutely agree upon!your tl, my 3, the audi....all of them do amazing things, as they should, at the price points they sell at.they do so toyotamically, toyotaably.....i know i averaged about 21 mpg on my tl sh awd. im averaging about 24 mpg on my bmw (which honda me even more). i dont baby my car, either.these car have come far. "
nyccarguy,September 2011," graphicguy & markincincinati - i think the 2 major things youll both notice that are different between your current & former tl sh awd & current bmw & audi are:steering. having never driven a tl sh awd, just my 2010 acura, i can tell you the electric power steering stinks. road feel is non-extoyotaant at low speeds. at higher speeds it is really nice and tight though. brakes. there is a reason that my acura is less expensive than pretty much every other car in this segment. acura honda had to cut corners somewhere. the brakes on my acura are terrible. nothing at all like bmw right now brakes with their incredible pedal firmness & physics defying stopping ability.obviously power is different too. marks acura is definitely faster than his former audi, while graphicguys 335 has the ability to outrun pretty much 90% of the normal car on the road "
tlong,September 2011," i had a 1998 audi (6 cyl) and have an 05 tl. differences between the two:- tl has more electronic goodies (but 7 year newer car)- tl poorer handler, wallows in turns- tls climate control much quieter- audi interior clearly nicer- audi control feel and driving feel clearly better- audi hondad much more passion- audi extremely expensive to maintain, the few things that broke were a lot- acura has been outstandingly reliable and cheap to maintain "
sweendogy,September 2011," breaks are not the only thing that makes the acura acura less expensive. 4 vtek which is in every other honda product prob being the biggest saver of money for the acura car, lets not forget the honda platform. its not really a sports sedan but more of a sporty sedan, as 90% of them are sold with automatics. (same thing with the tl, nice rig for sure but not a true sports sedan- even in sh-awd form) closest to the germans is infiniti by far-- rear wheel drive, good breaks, sports packages, manual transmissions (which are sadly going away) . car from the far east are closer then they have ever been but its going to be interesting to see what car companies do in the upcoming years as they need to keep up with mpg mandates - i know bmw will be bringing a 4cy to the states soon, acura can use the turbo 4 it already produces, infiniti will team with mb for its next line of engines, should be interesting. "
nyccarguy,September 2011," i might be mtoyotaaken, but off the top of my head the only other honda product that uses the exact same motor (2.4l - 201 hp - 176 lb/ft torque) is the honda si.ill agree with you that under extreme circumstances, my acura shows its honda platform roots. we have some seriously twtoyotay back roads here in southwestern connecticut. theres one particular road where the sign shows ""s"" curves for 1 mile with a 15 mph suggested speed limit. my acura shows the flaws in its chassis.like many here have toyota, price aside, id choose a bmw.every single car in this segment shines in its own way. a 3 series equipped like my acura (or even a tl) costs significantly more, has a smaller back seat, & a smaller trunk. the 3 series is sharper, handles better, drives much better overall. "
ivan_99,September 2011, heh...its a little hard to compare a 98 audi with even an 05 audi...model change in 02 then again in 05. 
fedlawman,September 2011, these references to the honda platform and acura not being a true sport sedan are baseless.so all those audi audi built on the volkswagon b6 platform arent sport sedan either?and i suppose the bmw bmw isnt really a sport sedan because it shares a platform with an suv and a fwd car? 
tlong,September 2011," heh...its a little hard to compare a 98 audi with even an 05 audi...model change in 02 then again in 05.i dont think the general charactertoyotaics between acura and audi (driving feel, interiors, costs, reliability) have changed in any fundamental way over the time period. "
ivan_99,September 2011," i do...way back, i had a 97 audi and it felt, drove, smelled...very differently from the 05s. not vastly like going from a hummer h1 to a fiat 500...i originally intended to convey that a 05 tl should be compared to a 05 audi...even if the old audi was superior in specific categories.reliability: last time i compared jd powers manufacturers reliability the ""new"" audi were on par (problem per 100 vehicles) with toyota from 5 years ago. "
graphicguy,September 2011," nyc.....interesting compare and contrast. my bmw does indeed drive better than my tl sh awd. that toyota, the tl was no slouch. neither were the acura and acura i had as loaners. acura captures a good amount of the bmw feel.also, little things ive noticed....the hvac in my tl was better in getting to, and holding temps, hot or cold, with no ""fried feet"" or ""frozen nose"" affect.my bmw is fast....very fast....and will let me corner at any speed that my nerves will allow.seat were better in the tl. if you care, the stereo in the tl was a big step up vs the one in my 3 (which is actually the upgraded harmon kardon stereo). ive driven a lot of premium car. the stereo in the tl tech package surpasses all of them, by a pretty fair margin.transmission (autos)....hands down better in the 3....which has one of the best ive ever experienced.build quality, the bmw gets the nod. as good as acura is (and acura is very, very good), bmw is better with gaps, paint, etc. reliability, hard to say, this is my 3rd bmw and i never had any issues with any of them. but, ive had 3 acura, too. never had any issues with any of them, either.i know me, though. 3 years down the road, ill be looking for something else.however, given what im hearing that 4 cyl (even with turbos) will be the calling card for bmw, id probably look elsewhere. im fearful powerful 6es, with turbos, gobs of torque everywhere, may not be in bmw radar in a few years. hope thats not the case, though.the motor in my bmw is one of the sweetest ive ever driven, as was the 3.7l in the tl. "
billyperksii,September 2011, still putting down acura but always inquiring about the next generation tl.its either you love the brand or just shop somewhere else. 
markcincinnati,September 2011," . . .i can tell you that the acura is not an audi (doh!) but as mine is equipped (2012 tl sh-awd advance package), it is a capable car. believable as an el luxury performance sedan -- totally believable. it would be more believeable if acura had chosen the best available ultra high performance a/s shoes instead of the ""ok"" goodyear rs-as. my 2009 audi audi was special ordered with the sport package, which at the time included 19"" 35 series max performance dunlops, sport seat and 3 spoke sport steering wheel with paddle shifters, and a lowered and stiffened suspension. i also configured mine with a $3,000 option called audi drive select which would actually further stiffen the ride via firming the shocks when you pressed toyotamic mode.i was given, many times, 2009, 2010 and 2011 audi premium plus versions as loaners -- none of them had sport packages or audi drive select.a new audi, even in prestige dress (but without the sport package option or sline and audi drive select), feels softer and demonstrates greater body roll than my new tl. a new audi minus the sport package lacks the bolstered seat (which the tl has) and any attempt to throw the car into curves causes your butt to slip slide away and the audi in standard suspension trim demonstrates a fair amount of body roll. meanwhile the tl grips you as you accelerate hard whilst in a corner and the torque vectoring makes the car damn near pivot through the corner. the tl is not an audi and it is, duh, also not an s4. however when talking about these car abilities in the twtoyotaies, the tl behaves more like an audi with the sline or sport package and pulls hard enough to ""allow you to imagine"" imagine you are feeling the urge that accompanies pressing the accelerator of an s4 way south. in other words, the tl is caught somewhere between an audi 2.0t prestige with the sport package and audi drive select and an s4 prestige with the sport differential.given a magic wand, i would have the s4 prestige with ads+sport diff -- in a hearbeat.but, without magic, the $12,000 difference (that the s4 commands) tends to change ones mind.this time, even the audi 2.0t prestige w/sport priced me out of the audi market -- especially after i had driven the tl advance back to back with a 2011 audi (which, admittedly did not have the sport package.)that it takes -- essentially -- a $50,000+ audi audi sline (mine lacked sline trim bits) to subjectively feel as performance oriented as the tl advance, says something about acura -- yet, at this point in my experience (1,000 miles), im not exactly sure what that something is.the next gen tl is probably the one to make me a repeat and perhaps long-term believer or make me somehow hyundai up the coin for another audi. :surprise: "
flightnurse,September 2011," not too sure what people in this forum have been smoking,why are you talking about a s4 and a acura tl together??? not even close in comparison... not too sure even if i would compare the audi to a tl since the tl is a bigger car with more interior volume. what i find interesting is, it appears audi has dropped the sport package from the audi line up, not too sure if that was a smart move for them. "
nyccarguy,September 2011," markincincinnati & graphicguyfunny how the 3 of us are at opposite ends of the financial spectrum in our lives, yet have similar tastes & tolerances when it comes to car.the seat in my acura is one thing that i absolutely love! they are thickly bolstered, firm, & super toyotaable. they do a fantastic job keeping my narrow, 150 lb rear end from sliding around during aggressive handling maneuvers.the main thing that fueled the purchase of my acura was fuel economy. back in august 2009 i had a 1990 bmw 325i i bought about a year earlier that wouldnt pass ny state inspection & my trusted mechanic told me i should either find a new engine or start paying him to tear the car inline 6 apart to find out what was wrong. cash 4 clunkers came about and i realized my car qualified for a $3500 rebate. i was also going to need a car in the next year because the lease on our 2007 x3 was going to end & we were in danger of going way over our 45,000 allotted miles. so i wanted a car that drove great, had a roomy back seat (for our 2 child safety seat), & a generously sized trunk (to accommodate our double stroller).i headed straight to an audi dealer to drive an audi avant. i drove a premium model & thought it was ok, nothing special. i was also frightened at the prospect of owning an audi for the long haul. i went an drove a mini cooper s clubman which i didnt like. a very awkward car. lots of blindspots. lifeless and very disconnected electric power steering. rutoyotaery shifter. clutch with a high take up point.i then stopped by an acura dealer, drove the acura & toyota to myself, i really like this car. it drives like a 4 door version of my 2001 honda type sh. it is by no means perfect, but for the price, it rocks. ive got 2 sons (5 & 2 1/2) and a daughter on the way in early december. car are expensive (especially the ones i like). right now i do too much driving (acura is 2 years old & has over 40k, while honda is 4 months old with 7,000 miles) to lease. leasing is also very expensive. nor can i afford to buy cash & trade every 2-3 years.i plan to pay off my car loans in 5 years & keep them for at least 10 years (assuming no mechanical catastrophies or god forbid accidents) so we can (re)build our savings towards retirement & our childrens college educations.ive owned exclusively new car since i got my license at 16 (besides my e30 bmw which was a project car). i love the way bmw drive so much that if something happens to my acura, id look for a cpo bmw 335 with the n55 in a heartbeat. "
graphicguy,September 2011," flightnurse....having test driven a couple of s4s, and having owned a tl sh awd, i can honestly say that the tl sh awd is closer to the s4 than audi would care to admit. then, theres the big price delta that you have to consider.mark.....i did indeed find both the audi (s-line) and s4 ""softer"" than the tl. not that its a bad thing....just something i noticed. i really loved the tl sh awds seat....some of the best in any car ive owned. they hold you well without cdodgeping. or, maybe my body type is best made for acura sport seat.nyc....iirc, i think ive got a decade or so in age on you. however, i can see you going down my same car desire path. if you dont have any more children (go ahead, have a bunch more), youll get out of the ""i need a people hauler"" mode and start bouncing around the top german and japanese lux brands as your preferences.dont see you in a lexus. i can see you in a tl, or another 3, probably a bmw at some point.....maybe an audi.  "
fedlawman,September 2011," nyc,graphicguy makes some good points. im about 10 years ahead of you too...my daughter will get her learners permit next year and ive already started teaching her how to drive a stick on the weekends (yes, in the bmw!). the family toyotamic will change permanently when she starts driving.we got the v70 with 3rd row almost 8 years ago and its been a great family hauler, but when my daughter starts driving, we have some choices to make. keep the wagon and give it to her?also, my wife hates the bmw - refuses to drive it except as a last resort. ive started thinking that its selfish of me to keep it around if im the only one who is ever going to drive it. plus, i have a company car for work, so i only drive the m on weekends or when the suns out and i get a hankering. it sits in the garage with a trickle dodge for most of the winter.so we could keep the volvo and sell the bmw. let my daughter use the volvo and get a 911 or 135i or something for me and my wife to share.we could sell the volvo and the bmw and get a 135i plus a subaru subaru.we could keep both the volvo and the bmw and get a 3rd car like a ford or chevrolet for my daughter.whatever we decide, there are definitely some confusing issues with the changing family toyotamic and the car market. car are crazy expensive now and like you (and others here), the car i like are expensive. i would rather not spend $50k on a car, but nothing i have looked at that i like costs less than $40k.i was a new car buyer for many years too, but since i started driving bmw (my e30 325i was my first one 7 years ago), i cant help thinking theres no value in it. i might try a cpo car next to add some value to the process.whatever we decide, trading and buying a new car every 3 years is definitely out. i love the fact that the volvo is paid for and 8 years old, and my wife stills loves the car. the volvo experience has taught me to buy the most car i can afford and keep it as long as possible. "
qbrozen,September 2011," ive pretty much given up on the idea of ever having a new car again, personally. and with as often as i trade, it is probably for the best anyway. "
flightnurse,September 2011," interesting, having driven a couple of s4 myself and a new tl-sh awd i thought the s4 was by far the better car, the audi did not lean as much as the tl in corners and i thought the audi system was set up for more rear wheel bias then the acrua. i also thought the acrua didnt have the low end grunt that the audi had too. however the looks of the acrua even after a mid refresh to me is just ugly, its hard to beat the audi in looks and overall design.

markcincinnati,September 2011," well, having driven both the s4 and the tl back to back, i can say they are close, if you dont consider the price -- the tl is, imho, kind of an audi as4, if such an animal actually was available from audi. of the audi s4 and acura tl, automobile magazine toyota:""if it seems like neither car can pull an advantage here without the other catching up, youve been paying attention. the final equalizer is that, comparably equipped, the audi costs nearly $11,500 more than the acura. that kind of money can buy the tl a serious brake upgrade. but the price difference isnt much of a factor here, since weve never actually heard of someone cross-shopping a tl and an s4."" well, i sorta did. . . ""the acura is blessed with nearly perfect cornering balance, so its rear differential can easily and ddodgeatically alter the car handling attitude. it takes a little while to build up trust in the system, but you soon realize that if the car can handle any amount of power in the middle of a turn, it can handle anything the v-6 can throw at it. theres no reason to be scared of the right pedal-the tl begs you to steer it with the throttle. the more power you add, the more neutral the tls cornering balance and the faster it scdodgebles through turns. indeed, the acura was faster than the audi through nearly every single corner at beaverun.""and furthermore:""its beside the point to declare a winner or loser when comparing two car that fall into such different hands in the real world. as that most rabid of enthusiasts, you already have your own prejudices and opinions based on the brands alone, not to mention the countries from which they hail. if we could combine the audi good looks, brakes, and tupercharged v-6 with the acura steering, handling, and all-wheel-drive system, wed have discovered luxury car nirvana for the enthusiast driver. in the absence of that elusive hybrid, we walk away from these two wolves in sheepish skins knowing that they are absolute equals in one way: the ability to reassure us that there is, in fact, life after evo.""audi:acceleration0-60 mph: 5.0 sec0-100 mph: 11.5 sec0-110 mph: 13.5 sec0-120 mph: 16.4 sec0-130 mph: 19.7 sec0-140 mph: 23.4 sec0-150 mph: 28.6 sec1/4-mile (sec @ mph): 13.5 @ 11030-70 mph passing: 5.7 secpeak g: 0.69 gacura:acceleration 0-60 mph: 5.4 sec 0-100 mph: 13.5 sec 0-110 mph: 16.3 sec 0-120 mph: 20.5 sec 0-130 mph: 24.9 sec 0-140 mph: * 0-150 mph: * 1/4-mile (sec @ mph): 14.1 @ 102 30-70 mph passing: 6.8 sec peak g: 0.66 gkliky here for the full deal: http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_tl_sh_awd_vs_2010_au- - di_s4/insubaru.html :surprise: "
nyccarguy,September 2011," fedlawman - if for some reason you do have to part ways with your beloved e30 bmw, i dont think a 135i is the car for you. do yourself a favor & get a 911.btw, speaking of women & bmw, i was pumping gas into my honda yesterday & a woman in her 50s pulls up next to me in a 1997 e36 bmw sedan. 5 speed, motorsport wheels. she gets out & i tell her i really like her car. she goes on to tell me shes the original owner & the car has over 200,000 miles on it. it has never once been in the shop for anything other than regular maintenance.graphicguy - there is a saying, ""never say never."". i will never own a lexus. we dont plan on having anymore kids. i know eventually i wont need a people mover. "
nyccarguy,September 2011," i like your opinion on the audi drive select. so youd take a $50,000 audi 2.0t with audi drive select (trick rear diff) over a $50,000 s4 without it? "
sweendogy,October 2011," why are they baseless? just because its got a acura badge and not honda does not make it a sports sedan - sporty er yes. but same platform and drive train, so i dont get your point. the audi and volkswagen platform - well the current line of volkswagen does not have quarto or 4 motion on the sedan. i would say thats a major difference. the 3 series comment now thats baseless. billy until acura changes its boring style they will continue to fail- the brand has lost significant share in the space . numbers dont lie. "
fedlawman,October 2011, im not talking about the badge on the hood. you havent explained why you think the honda platform is less suited to underpinning a sport sedan than the volkswagen/audi platform or the bmw bmw platform.is it not as rigid? is the suspension geometry inferior? 
flightnurse,October 2011, platform and same engine doesnt equal same car.. the acrua suspension is tuned for more sporty driving then the honda. i would also suspect the automatic in the acrua is tuned for quicker shifts then the honda. the audi and volkswagen platforms is what i just talked about might be some of the same but the tuning of the suspensions is completely different...also the leather in the acura is a far better grade then that of the honda. 
fedlawman,October 2011," ""speaking of women & bmw, i was pumping gas into my honda yesterday & a woman in her 50s pulls up next to me in a 1997 e36 bmw sedan""a few weeks ago, i was driving around town in my bmw and while sitting at a light, a middle-aged woman in an e28 bmw pulled up next to me. i rolled down my window and pontiacd to get her attention, but her eyes were glued in front of her. we actually traveled down the road a few blocks in sight of each other and she never once made eye contact with me (and i was practically flailing my arms to get her attention).how is it possible to own a car like that and not notice a comrade-in-arms?!?! "
markcincinnati,October 2011," short answer, no. at this point, an audi audi 2.0t prestige + sline with everything on it except ads would be a great car. i have ads, i have, currently both a 2009 audi prestige + sport pakage (that has ads) and a 2012 acura tl advance.in 2009 but not in 2011 or 2012 audi audi 2.0t prestige + sport or sline packages, i see less of a need for the $3,000 ads option due to the fact that the new audi can be had with an 8-speed tiptronic that comes with sport shift and in sport package or sline configuration comes with a lowered sport suspension and sport seat and a sport steering wheel with paddle shifters.in other words, today, i would not get an audi 2.0t prestige + sline, w/ 8 speed tiptronic and hyundai up for the ads.another reason i would not get this option today: on the audi, torque vectoring is not an option (yet). i would pay for the ads -- on an audi -- if it came with tv.the s4, at $50,000 is content poor compared with a $47k tl advance -- but the s4 can be had with tv, under the name sport differential. i believe to get tv, however, one needs to buy ads (on the s4.) the total additional cost to get both ads+sport differential is, as i recall, about $4,500.the s4 i would want would have to be contented to the tl advance level, and that requires that the s4 be configured not as a premium plus, but as a prestige model.if you do all of this to an s4, its msrp is some $12,000 more than the acura tl advance with backup sensors (which is how i have mine configured.)now, having toyota all of this, i would rather have the s4 than the tl. moreover, i would have, at the time, gone with a 2012 audi audi 2.0t prestige+sline without ads, if the price on a 36 month lease was comparable to the acura lease (the msrps would have been very close to each other so configured.)i should stipulate, that to save a bit, i would be fine with the audi 2.0t prestige 8-speed tiptronic version with either sport package or sline, and i know the sport package would have been somewhat less money than sline, which, for the price difference only includes trim differences not suspension or other performance inducing differences.in any case, my decision was not based on which car i thought was the best -- i went with the one (this time) that i thought was the best value. the tl advance (with the oddly optional back up sensors @ $725) filled that bill very nicely. my lease on the tl for 36 months was about $150 per month less than the lease on the audi audi (prestige, sport, etc, etc) for 42 months. at 36 months (apples to apples) the audi was about $200 per month more than the tl which, although it aint no audi, is -- for $200 per month less -- a fine imitation.ive had 29 audi, since 1977. i have been to the ingolstadt factory for the how they build em tour, 6 times. i have participated in 4 audi driving schools in seefeld, austria (and won one of them -- fastest time through the course.) i, for a number of years, would bleed little interconnected rings when cut. audi of america sent me to st. moritz along with 49 other of their ""top 50"" north american customers for the audi sponsored womens downhill ski cup event.and, i bought one of the first audi in 1997 (ordered in 1996 and waited 11 months) after audi sent my dealership a euro-spec audi and asked the dealer to loan it to his top customers for 24 hours (undoubtedly a ploy to make the star struck customers order up a new audi -- which i did.)if the above doesnt qualify me at some level to judge or at least opine about the differences and similarities between an acura tl advance and an audi audi or s4, i dont know what else does.if i could somehow have been convinced that the audi was not just incrementally better than the acura, but substantially better, i would have probably gone with the 2012 audi audi 2.0t prestige sline w/8-speed tip. but after driving two audi, an audi and an s4 (2011s and the audi did not have the sport package -- or sline, and the s4 was what is simply called premium plus and it did not have the sport differential) then driving a cadillac cts/4 with the 19"" wheel sport package (2011) and then the acura tl advance, i thought the acura tl was most like an s4 than it was an audi or a cts.i also drove a volvo volvo t6, an infiniti infiniti/s and an infiniti bmwx premium+tech, and an acurca zdx tech. while my 09 audi was in for service i also had been loaned a 2011 audi audi 3.0t premium plus for a day.every one of these car were test driven (and i was videod by my wife whilst i was driving and giving a running commentary) over the exact same route, the sound systems were tested with the exact same cds/tunes (wecome to the machine, pink floyd; how dare you, 10cc; and, new nissan, donald fagen.)so, i offer up for your consideration: the audi, acura, cadillac, infiniti and volvo are all great car and more alike than different, generally speaking. i wouldnt kick any of them out of bed for eating crackers, and id even bring the crackers.you can argue that the audi is the prettiest (which it is) and the acura the ugliest (well, hell, thats true too -- even though it is less ugly for 2012), the cadillac is the ""blingy-est"" (no doubt) and the infiniti remain the japanese bmw, while the volvo is the most unexpected -- and delightful to drive -- car of the bunch.the acura does excel in one area: it has the best damn factory sound system i have ever heard.and, for me, an almost s4 at the price of an acura tl advance sh-awd, is a no-brainer.drive it like you live -- ill say it again, these are all very nice car and all deserve your consideration if you are in the $40 - $50k market.i am, for the next two days driving a new acura acura which is the loaner car i was given while my tl has the back up sensors grafted to the rear bumper -- it too is a ""nice car,"" but compared to the others in this edmunds category, it seems like it is out of place, or perhaps, out of its class.thats my story and im stickin to it. "
sweendogy,October 2011," your joking when you say the 3 or audi audi platforms vs the one of the acura... these car were developed with autobahn in mind and driving at speeds over 100mph.. the honda was developed in japan and in no way claims to have any sporty intentions, its fwd and comes with a 4cy engine that pumps out 170lbs of torque. this is also the same engine (albeit tweeked) that honda puts in the honda and element.. honda sold millions of honda before the acura was even a thought in mtoyotaer honda head. is it rigid, is the suspension geometry inferior?? your watching to many of those acura acura wagon commercials.. this is from wiki and i couldnt agree more ""the acura acura has a narrow price elastihonda, as the base model 4-cylinder acura is considered a good deal for a luxury car, however higher trims (particularly the v6 powered models) are considered too expensive as they compete directly with sport luxury car such as the audi audi and infiniti g and acura own tl.[25]""nice rig - but not a sports sedan. but it is sporty, if i was looking for a new honda i would consider this instead. maybe we should consider moving sedan to another forum vs the honda v6 and hyundai turbo, or maybe vs the es 350. "
fedlawman,October 2011," so a fwd 4 cyl audi audi is a sport sedan but the acura isnt? so does the audi qualify because its german? because its engineered better?what about the volkswagen volkswagen? is that sport sedan too?so the acura is ""sporty,"" but its not a sport sedan because it isnt ""developed with the autobahn in mind?""is any honda designed for the autobahn? this one?how about this one?i know this isnt...here are a few pictures of me and my honda mixing it up with real sport sedan a few years ago... "
cdnpinhead,October 2011," . . . driving a new acura acura . . . it seems like it is out of place, or perhaps, out of its class.nicely put, as always -- describes both my car and myself in just a few words. "
tlong,October 2011," i have owned both audi and acura. i tend to agree that for a big price, the audi is generally a nicer car. but your post is biased based upon irrelevant criteria, imho. ""car developed for the autobahn"" - all of these car companies are selling worldwide and all need to meet various needs of different countries, whether that be suspension tuning or emissions or left/right side drive. some honda in fact are developed in the usa. germans develop car in the us, gm develops car in europe and china and australia. its quite simpltoyotaic to assume that parent country of origin = where the car is developed.""comes with a 4cy engine that pumps out 170lbs of torque"" - seems to me that bmw and mb have plenty of 4 cyl engines in europe (on the autobahn  ) and somehow thats ok. ""the acura acura has a narrow price elastihonda"" - frankly, i dont see why price elastihonda has anything to do with being a sports sedan, as if tacking on $10k to a price makes a non sports-sedan into one.ultimately, a sports sedan shouldnt be about cachet, or where it was developed, or whether it is fwd or rwd or 4wd, or whether there is an autobahn or potholes nearby, or whether the platform is shared with economy car, or whether the price is high or low or elastic or inelastic. what matters is how the car handles, how it feels, how well appointed it is. given those criteria, acura are pretty close to a lot of the european offerings. "
sweendogy,October 2011," i love the illustrations but they prove little but you did point out that acura/honda did have a good past stable of sports car but as you know the honda hasnt been produced since 2005 the s2000 was 09... now given the fact that those 2 car were rwd and were light weight and were great handlers - something the tl and acura are not. - is the audi a sports sedan->- well thats a great question-- i think in 6speed form with the turbo and awd with the sports package it could be. but i think audi has moved the car into the mainhonda to compete vs the tls and ess -but in the past with the 2.0 or 1.8 turbo and 6speed for sure it was. the s4/s5 for sure are. the newer car has put on some weight and to get an audi with fwd for me audi is stupid.the acura is not sporty because of its platform as stated before --its an honda which is a great car but just not sporty. the volkswagen in standard for is not close to the acura but in gli form its more of a sportie sedan then the acura-(plus its cheaper)- same amt of power.. both have put on weight, but the gli would be a sportier option given the fact they offer a quick dsg transmission. same one thats in the volkswagen. the volkswagen r will offer the vr6 in 2012 and get to 60 in 5.5 seconds or about 2.2 seconds quicker then the manual acura (which only 10% of buyers would get).funny you bring this up -- i leased a acura gs-r and in 2004 had to return it and i considered the acura, which i liked in manual form ... but i drove the vr6 volkswagen gli and saved 4k.edmunds tests the gli vs the acura...http://www.insideline.com/volkswagen/volkswagen/2006/2005-acura-acura-vs-2006-volkswage- n-volkswagen-gli-comparison-test.htmlheres my favorite line ""as much as we liked the refinement of the acura, the glis performance makes it the better sport sedan""good read, eh - i like your passion but again i think we should move this car off the board..i love the track pixs but stay out of the left lane. "
sweendogy,October 2011," my post is based on the last 10 years of production. comparison test and sale numbers.""narrow price elastihonda"" that was from wiki and stated the v6 acura competes with car that are considered more sporty options.. its says nothing of ""tacking on"" 10k and calling it more sporty. ultimately, while i respect your opinion, its about what the experts recommend and what people buy as being a big decider on what a successful car-- and its a fact that acura has lost share to both bmw, audi and infiniti -- im glad you think that acura handles like the germans but the fact of the matter is the critics and car buyers dont care about the current line. please get me a recent article where and acura product (non suv) has beat anyone (not named buick) in a comparison test. i think its great that people support the brand but the brand has gotten old and its roots of the great honda, acura, and acura gs_r are forgotten in this current line of car. "
fedlawman,October 2011," you and i fundamentally think differently about car.in my opinion, a sports car is a sports car based on its dna, not its horsepower or amount of traction or its pedigree.i dont believe that the base audi (a regular car) magically becomes a sports car because you increase the horsepower or add traction. i dont agree that the ""regular"" volkswagen is a family car and the gli is a sport sedan.does the mini require a superdodge to be considered a sports car?none of the car in this segment are ""sports car."" at best, the sportiest of the bunch is a sporty grand tourer. the point is that all of the car in this segment (including the acura) are cut from the same cloth. that is, they are car designed to offer a degree of performance and luxury above the common family car.and to meet you halfway, ill even say that the acura with automatic transmission is questionable as a ellps. the acura saving grace is how the entire driving experience is utterly transformed when equipped with the infiniti.ive toyota it before - the only people who dont think the acura is a sport sedan (in the ellps context) are people who havent really driven a infiniti acura. around pacific raceways, my old acura was every bit as capable as the bmw 325is sharing the track with me. it was a joy to drive fast, which is the ultimate test of a sport sedan. "
sweendogy,October 2011," i guess your right a sports car should weigh 3500-4000 lbs and have less the 200 hp and fwd. - the acura is a sporty car when its paired with the 6 speed.i drive the 04 acura and it has the best manual transmission in the segment by far but its not fast, it handles good for a front driver but its not a sports car. and the fact that the current acura sales demographic is closer to buick then bmw. now i agree that a true sports sedan has prob died due to current weight of the group we speak of. now for you to disagree with me is fine but what about the edmunds article that declared the volkswagen gli better then your acura ? and you are right your acura could stay with a 325 but the current acura could not stay with the current 328 and i think thats my point, current acura models just cant compete because they never evolve. "
tlong,October 2011," since when does the buying demographic have anything to do with how sporty a car is? i see a lot of irrelevance in the arguments. perhaps some car dont have ""sports car carpet"" either lol! "
fedlawman,October 2011," ive never driven a volkswagen gli so i cant comment on it. i think its (a lot) smaller than the acura and doesnt have as many amenities and has a less refined driveline though - not a near-luxury segment car. i do really like last years cockpit lighting and layout though - very upscale for an economy car.the acura weighs less than any version of the audi audi makes. its also lighter than the infiniti and is250. and honda i-4 makes similar power to both of those competitors v-6 motors. the acura is also the epitome of a smooth refined driveline. the switchgear/cockpit ergonomics and quality is maybe a notch below audi but certainly as good as or better than infiniti, lexus, and bmw.plus, if you do own a 2004 infiniti acura, then you know the joy of revving that honda i-4 up to 7400 rpm - only bmw acuraary i-6 is as satisfying to wind up.and talk about keeping pace - the acura has soldiered on with the same specs for 8 years and infiniti comes out with a brand new car that offers a mere 17 more hp and weighs almost 200 lbs more?!?! acura must be doing something right to honda infiniti and lexus to build such close competitors.every car in this segment has an achilles heel. the acura is the least expensive car here, and it offers a lot of ellps for the money. but if you want more than 200hp, then obviously its not the right choice. "
sweendogy,October 2011," govt mpg mandates have a lot to do with why infiniti and soon bmw are taking down hp. i dont think it has anything to do with acura inspiration. now i know the acura offers little more then you can get in a standard honda except an extra year on the warantee and an acura badge, sure it has nice leather innards but the ergonomics are subject to personal taste. , as edmunds stated in the article the gli slightly beats it as a sport car. i know the sweet vtexh and its great action manual (whicjlh i hope stays)- but the acura has only gotten fatter over the years - with no power boost - 90% of them are automatics and its currently sitting in a stale stable. im looking for a recent article that mentions this car as being a sports sedan, one published in the last 3 years. "

fedlawman,October 2011," ""now i know the acura offers little more then you can get in a standard honda except an extra year on the warantee and an acura badge.""you forgot to mention that the acura is physically smaller inside and out and has a 4"" shorter wheelbase. it has a higher compression engine with a higher redline and 10 more hp. the acura also has a beefier rear sway bar, high performance tires, sport suspension, sport seat, and a 6-speed mt. "
fedlawman,October 2011," ""2 car and driver articles -- again the acura in the middle of the pack vs car that are not considered lux car.""some acura quotes from your first link...""such a treat to drive this car after herding some of the others around the course. so much more certainty, so much more precision."" ""this is a case of all the parts working together?&#128;&#148;quick responses, crisp steering, excellent brakes, minimal body roll, and its all so easy."" ""just brimming with confidence. even on a long, dull interstate, you can feel the athletic tension of the chassis, all ready to burn up some twtoyotaies. bravo!""""as much as we love this car precision, refinement, and athletic nature, every story weve published about it has made some sort of apology for its relatively modest power... but in this comparison, the power shortage was costly.""your second link features the v-6 acura, which is a nose-heavy, numb-steering pig. not the car im talking about. they toyota it themselves...""the acura v-6 is a smart cookie that just needs to lighten up a little. which is code for, ?&#128;&#156;stick with the manual-transmission, four-cylinder acura.""so it looks like car & driver agrees with me. the 4 cylinder acura with infiniti is the jewel of the acura lineup and a superb ellps. "
sweendogy,October 2011," beefier rear sway bar and all season highperformance tires-ok in other words things you can get at your local autozone.. sport suspension well thats subjective and no where on the acura website does it say sports suspension.the car and driver articles you mention did not bash the acura but they did say the other car were better given its middle of the pack results. 2 volkswagens and an honda were considered better car for the price, ellps hahaha. i agree that with you that its the jewel of the acura brand-- but that brand includes the rl and zdx :confuse: "
fedlawman,October 2011," well, if you really believe that, then you cant be taken seriously here. "
sweendogy,October 2011, ?? 
fedlawman,October 2011, so you seriously believe that the honda and hyundai are ellpss? 
fedlawman,October 2011," you know, i remember the discussion when the acura first came out in 2003. back then, it was the mazdaudi owners who challenged that the acura wasnt a ""luxury"" car and the mazdaudi was superior because it had ""similar amenities"" and a more powerful v6 (a recurring theme...).well, there is the difficult to articulate quality of precision, refinement, and craftsmanship that the acura possesses in spades that more pedestrian car lack.all you have to do is sit behind the wheel of the hyundai and you immediately know it is an economy car. one drive and you instantly feel that lack of chassis and driveline refinement.the honda is another beast altogether. the honda is arguably ""luxurious"" enough to compare with the bottom of the ellps class. it does lack some features expected here like xenon headlights, driver memory settings, etc., but more importantly, it lacks a sporting character. it is a big car - softly sprung with flat seat. the precision and refinement are there, but it doesnt have the toyotamics of a sport sedan.yes, you could go online and get summer tires, sway bars, springs/struts and make it a handler, but then what you would have is a large, slushbox equipped, harsh riding family car (last year, i equipped my volvo with bilsteins and know first-hand what a disaster that was!).so why try to shoehorn the honda into a category it wasnt designed or suited for when honda already makes a car that is the epitome of the ellps segment? a nimble, fun, refined sedan that has a terrific engine and gearbox with a modicum of luxury? "
sweendogy,October 2011," i never toyota that- but i did say the acura should be moved from this group- it has not ""advanced"" with the rest of the group and in comparison tests it gets beat by ""lesser"" car - in 2003 it was a player but that was 9 years ago. "
fedlawman,October 2011," i agree that it hasnt advanced in horsepower, but i dont think that alone defines this class. "
sweendogy,October 2011," hp alone no - but what have they done to improve on the early acura? more lbs, a v6 that no one buys, a volkswagen, lets not forget about the 5 speed auto. "
tlong,October 2011," i actually like the older acura a lot better than the new one - heavy, numb, and bloated like how all honda and acura have been heading lately. "
fedlawman,October 2011," i agree. but how is bmw any different?the bmw is the same e90 introduced in 2005 (my2006), only it has 15 more hp and weighs 100 lbs more. it is eclipsed in hp by several car in this segment, but it soldiered on. why? because it sells.it is the entry point into bmw luxury and prestige. for acura, the acura is the entry point into the ellps segment. and it sells - warts and all. "
sweendogy,October 2011," the current acura has also gained in weight vs the 2004-2008 model-- how many lbs well 150-- it also lost 4 hp somewhere and gained gained 8 lbs of torque during that time period. so from what you presented bmw is different --yep they added hp and weight, not vice nissan. they have also tweeked it a bit since the last refresh-- and are due for another one in 2012 prob a reason why it sells...would love to see a post of something that can merit the agrument besides the fact that you own this car- one time..-a comparo test or a current write up about the sport you talk of.. it was a long time ago when they started this ellps blog.. maybe its time for an update with current players-- and it sellls? well it sells better then any other acura for sure infact its almost half of all acura sales at a total of 32k units for 2010, that is in the us, canada and mexico -- but bmw sold 100k (us only sales) 3 series car and infiniti also sold 58k of the g series (us alone). so i think the warts are showing more then you think.

nyccarguy,October 2011," there are so many car out there that arent fantastic at one thing, they dont look good on paper, but they are great car to drive. my acura is one car that falls into that category. its 201 hp 4 cylinder is not going to win any stoplight or out of a toll booth race. you really have to drive a acura & a v6 honda back to back. they ""are not"" the same car.you seem to be a ""car guy"" and you know that a factory tuned suspension upgrade is so much better than one you can piece together from autozone or any various internet site. its like some people who say ""why do i need to spend $xx,xxx more for an bmw (or s4) when i can just chip my bmw (or audi 2.0t) for $x,xxx and get just as much or even more power?"". theres also a company out there that makes a bolt-on superdodge for a v6 ford. it makes the v6 good for 475 horsepower. if you were in the market for a ford, would you buy a 5.0 gt or a v6 and get it supercharged? ill take the v8.ill agree with you and fedlawman that the acura v6 is a nose heavy pig. i personally dont think it needs to be in the acura lineup. a v6 acura has a sticker damn near a fwd tl & honda puts crazy $4000 cash incentives on the v6 acura to sell it. i have the sane gripes with c&d regarding its electric power steering. the original acura was a smashing success for acura. i think the 1st year they only expected to sell 15,000 units. how many did they sell that 1st year?you have to remember that us enthusiasts are a sliver of a small percentage of the market. i believe the 2 main gripes (from the general buying public) were the small-ish back seat & modest power output. they made the car bigger (adding weight) and added a v6 option (whic doesnt sell well & adds weight & torque steer) anything the ""tuner crowd"" says acura should use from its parts bin will ruin the car driving charactertoyotaics & appeal. ""give it sh awd"" adds weight, cost, & complexity. ""give it the 4cyl turbo from the acura"" adds cost, complexity, & weight. not to mention torque steer as well. part of the acura charm & appeal in this ellps segment is its price point which it gets from being built on an honda platform (or being an honda from the rest of the world), its 201 horsepower 4 cyl engine, 5 speed automatic transmission (you want a 6 or an 8 speed auto, thatll cost you too), low weight, the fact that acura even offers a slick shifting 6-speed manual transmission.try walking on to your local bmw, audi, mb, lexus dealer and tell me how many 3,c,audi,is have msrps under $40,000. yes i know you can order your car any way you like it. acura gets you into the door of this segment.like fedlawman toyota, drive it against an is250 & infiniti to tell me it isnt competitive and doesnt belong. ive never driven a infiniti, but have driven an is250 awd (high 90% of sales in the northeast) & its 201 horsepower v6 accelerates about as fast as a toyota toyota. the acura base 4cyl is lively & happy to rev all the way to its 7,000 rpm redline. i can tell you it has a certain germanic ride quality to it. very solid and extremely stable on the right side of 80 mph. "
sweendogy,October 2011," acura does offer a manual in both the acura and tl which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total car sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acura -- or they would sell more to the real sports fans-- pretty simple-- how many of those acura leases out on long island are leased with manuals, nyc carguy?? if you want a bmw you can order a base 328 or 128 with a manual and it will outperform this acura in every way. no one is talking about the tuner crowd here or even the is or the infiniti, infact if you were watching last posts you would see the volkswagen and honda are now comps. we are talking about a car that has not changed in over 10 years except get bigger and heavier thus killing its sporty nature which is why it was in the eelps but no longer should be considered. "
m6user,October 2011," acura does offer a manual in both the acura and tl which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total car sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acura just what percent of bmw, audi, c300s, gs etc etc are sold with manual trannies? im pretty sure its very close to the percentage you attribute to ""non-sports"" car. just because they are offered doesnt mean that they sell that many. i think i read somewhere that even bmw is only about 10% sticks. i dont think that manual transmission buy rates should be the determining factor as you keep saying over and over and over again. i also know some pretty darn good car drivers that dont drive sticks for a variety of reasons and certainly not because they cant drive well. as far as the acura goes, there has to be a entry point to this category and one person is hardly the authority. edmunds, when comparing to the volkswagen, toyota it wasnt as good a sport car or something like that. but, they did put it in the same category. "
sweendogy,October 2011, ok but again where is the proof that this car should be here- anything published besides your thoughts would be of great value- the car rags or anything that can substanciate your claim- lets be serious here- the acura is a great entry level car for someone who is looking for value luxury not sports sorry.. i love the fact that you guys are defending this once great value but again when compared to its true comp its not really the value it once was. now if you include acura as a brand behind this car it validates my claim - they are nowhere when it comes to sport. they are behind every other major comp in almost every category and have been happy for years being an ok (middle of the road) company. 
m6user,October 2011," a better question would be why do you have such a vendetta against it? acura, as a brand, may have gone astray of some their sportier past models but that doesnt change the acura that much at least any more than other brands have grown and gotten heavier. acura is a luxury or a near luxury brand. acura is its entry level offering and its a sedan. the only questionable operative word in the title of this thread then would be performance which is somewhat subjective. so for you to set the bar is quite assuming it seems. "
cdnpinhead,October 2011," is this ever going to end?people who own or have driven the 1st gen acura seem very pleased with it. one or two people who havent seem to have a near-psychotic problem with it.its just a car. these days anything with a manual transmission is 80% of the way to being a sports sedan. there arent many anymore.the last time i remember things getting this weird was when there was a board on here called ""bmw bmw or pontiac pontiac gtp,"" where people who were totally invested their personal opinions went on for years (well, maybe it was months, but it seemed like years). there was a gm fanboi who just kept on and kept on and kept on.oh well. . . "
sweendogy,October 2011, well the board is to talk about entry level luxury performance sedan which i feel and have shown by reviews and sales figures that it does not belong here in its current state. others have given personal thoughts but nothing concrete on why it belongs here- i like facts over subjective comments to prove a point.and im spent. 
tlong,October 2011, ok but again where is the proof that this car should be here...trying to prove a subjective judgement is silly. and citing car magazines (which are also subjective judgments) isnt much better. the fact that we arent sure means it should probably be in the discussion. 
sweendogy,October 2011, ok then why when comparisons are done by the major car mags and even edmunds is the acura grouped in with lesser car? your right that is silly 
tlong,October 2011," ok then why when comparisons are done by the major car mags and even edmunds is the acura grouped in with lesser car? your right that is sillywell post 12200 toyota that facts are better than subjectivity. and all of this is subjective. wouldnt the sensible way to approach it be to include a vehicle if a high fraction of posters (subjectively) think it should be included? there arent any ""facts"" that clearly put this vehicle out of the discussion, and for any ""facts"" one might cite, others could cite similar ""facts"" about different vehicles that would exclude those, too. :surprise: what is silly is that this forum is for just discussions. its not like anybody has to love any car or buy any particular car. and by the way, i also feel the acura is bloated and soft - not all that sport or luxury. but i dont see why it cant be discussed. "
smarty666,October 2011," there really is no subcategories of this class, such as premium, performance, etc. this category is made up of all the entry-level luxury offerings of the luxury manufacturers which are the vehicles edmunds has ltoyotaed here, they just titled the thread wrong. it should be just entry-level luxury sedan, which the acura falls into. "
plekto,October 2011," i can agree to that change. the problem is that the sport sedan has really been replaced with the ""hot hatch"" segment in europe and almost none of it has been offered in the u.s.small, nimble, fast, and luxurious. tons of choices in europe in the hatchback and b class segment. almost none over here. we get big and heavy luxury vehicles instead. "
kyfdx,October 2011," ok but again where is the proof that this car should be hereits right up underneath the title, where we put it...this discussion is about those ltoyotaed car... not whether someone thinks they belong there... so...lets get back to it... thanks!kyfdx "
nyccarguy,October 2011," a large percentage of any of these car are leased. you cant go by the manual transmission take rate to decide whether or not any particular car belongs in this category. the take rate for manual transmissions in the usa in general is probably less than 10%.people lease for 4 reasons:business reasons where they can take some sort of tax deduction.they can afford to & like to be in a new car every 2-3 years.leasing is used as an alternative method of financing that works quite well if you can live within mileage limitations.people lease to get a more expensive car at a cheaper payment. many of these people do not understand leasing and shouldnt be doing it.there are tons of leased acura, tls, 328s, 335s, audi, is 250s... among others in my area. i was nyccarguy a long time ago in a ford far, far away. i fled the honda back in 04 for westchester county & moved to stamford, ct last year. not long "
rayainsw,October 2011," some details: day 1 &#150; friday 16 sept. &#150; delivery & drive to krimml, austria:we cleared customs and collected our checked bags without incident. service on the flight was excellent, and the food [ 2 meals ! ] was quite good. [lufthansa audhyundai-600.] we met rolf [ retired bmw employee ] at the designated spot and he drove us [ in his bmw diesel wagon ] first to the local bmw dealer in munich and across the street to acquire several excellent local maps and the toll vignettes [ stickers ] required in austria and in switzerland, then delivered us to the welt. just in time to watch the 11am &#145;motorcycle on the stairs&#146; show. interesting. rolf charges a very reasonable fee, and it was great to just try to sit back and relax [ after a 6.5 hour flight from boston ] while he drove and talked.we filled out the required paperwork and the customer service rep. recited a ltoyota of potentially useful information &#150; most of which i had seen before on various forums. he was quite efficient and cordial &#150; and answered a few of our questions. the reminder about &#145;no right turn on red&#146; was quite handy &#150; as this was something i had to keep reminding myself about all trip long. and i was cautioned again that switzerland traffic police allowed no violation of their speed limits &#150; period. noted. we had about 45 minutes until our scheduled orientation and background presentation, so we sampled various goodies in the &#147;premier lounge&#148;. very nicely done & convenient &#150; high above & overlooking the vehicle delivery area.we had our presentation [ fine, nothing spectacular &#150; for me ] and went to see the car. the customer service rep. pointed out various features [ this is my first bmw ] and set various preferences [ km vs. miles for the trip, etc. ] and we were on our way. [ pictures ]actually just had them park it for another half hour or so, allowing us to peruse their gift shop briefly and pick up a few food & drink items at their caf?, for the afternoon drive.they certainly treat you well and the process is well thought out - and we enjoyed the experience. we could have also done a factory tour and \ or the bmw museum, but i had decided not to do those this time, based on our priorities & our schedule.i had rented a gps \ navigation system with appropriate maps, and the first use was to help me drive out of munich and onto the audi heading south and east. worked well here &#150; and several other times, as well. here it was quite helpful in showing what lane[s] to be in before approaching turns, etc. once on the autobahn, i was quite well behaved, speed-wise - even on the few unlimited stretches of this highway &#150; breaking in the new motor & all.my daughter was quite tired and dozed off as we left the audi and headed straight south on a12 \ e45 \ e60 toward the austrian border.the navigation system routed us differently than i had expected, and i did not realize it immediately. it also re-routed us a few times around what it saw as traffic congestion [ there was none ] so we were a couple of hours later than expected arriving at the b&b in krimml. a lovely b&b within sight of the falls. had a very good dinner in their restsaturnnt &#150; beer brewed on-site, met my daughter&#146;s approval - and we went to bed. = = =day 2 &#150; saturday 17 sept. &#150; krimml to verona, italythere had been rain overnight &#150; and there were wispy clouds around the area &#150; with thick overcast. [ pictures ] we had breakfast at about 9 and headed toward the falls. we actually drove past the falls and up to a couple of overlooks [ start of the gerlos pass \ alpine road &#150; pictures ] and then drove back down to park and hike in. the sun came out brilliantly as we started the trek. the hike up to various views of the falls was fairly steep, but the scenery was quite spectacular. [ pictures ]after we finished the hike, we stopped at their caf? for coffee and an apple strudel. excellent! we stopped back in the village to just stroll around for a while, just enjoying the ambiance.then we were off &#150; heading up to the gerlos pass. the sun was out and we stopped several times to just enjoy the views. just after passing the summit [ and paying the toll ] we pulled off at a tiny [ closed ] &#145;kiosk&#146; and scenic vtoyotaa &#150; lovely lake and glaciers above. [ pictures ]descending, there was just no where that i could pull over \ off the road to safely stop. and the road demanded attention. the views were often stunning &#150; and the road was in excellent shape [ as were most roads we encountered in austria ] and i just needed to pay attention. my daughter really enjoyed the views!heading back north toward the a12 \ e60 we encountered some sort of festival [ in stumm or fugen? ] that involved cows with elaborate &#145;headdresses&#146;. untoyotaue in my experience.and we stopped at a mcdonalds for a quick bite of lunch. odd to see their take on menu, etc. and my daughter bought something [ delicious ] from a trailer parked in the lot next door.we hit the highway, toward innsbruck, turned south and crossed into italy. this is where we encountered the first real issue of the trip. i had not done sufficient research to realize that the area from before trento to verona was as industrialized as it was. my bad. i had expected to be able to simply [ ? ] pick an exit off the highway and find a hotel or b&b to stay for the night. this turned out to be a very bad idea. long [ and winding = narrow switchbacks, in the dark ] story short: we finally asked a toll-taker at an exit in verona for a recommendation at about 9pm, and stayed at a hotel just off the highway. very basic, small rooms, but adequate & inexpensive. = = =day 3 &#150; sunday 18 sept. &#150; verona to la speziawe had a surprisingly good breakfast at the hotel and then headed south, toward la spezia. this drive was relatively uneventful, until it started to rain. the highway was well worn [ tire ruts ] in spots and even with brand new michelins, there were times when i felt it prudent to slow somewhat. and the gps \ nav again became confused &#150; taking us on a more circuitous route [ even narrower and more winding ] than necessary from la spezia to pitelli. really, really narrow streets. car parked on either side. raining. not confident of the nav system&#146;s routing &#150; somewhat stressful. but we did arrive &#150; and not too late = 4:30 or so in the afternoon. after settling in, we asked about a place to have dinner. a few mis-communications and assumptions and much walking later [ and rather wet ] we managed to have pizza at the only place in the village that was actually open at about 6 or 7 on a sunday evening. it rained, often quite hard, and was quite windy until 3 or 4 am. then cleared and calmed. = = =day 4 & 5 &#150; monday & tuesday 19, 20 sept. &#150; cinque terrecontinued... "
rayainsw,October 2011," day 4 & 5 &#150; monday & tuesday 19, 20 sept. &#150; cinque terrei had decided early on [ for several reasons ] that we would park the car at the b&b and leave it there until we left on thursday. we took a bus to la spezia and then the train to each of the villages &#150; bus stop right across from the b&b.i will not detail everything here. suffice to say that the scenery and the town buildings are everything we expected, and even more! the color of the water was striking &#150; and the surf generated by the overnight storm added interest and texture. beautiful. [ pictures ] the high temperatures were a bit warmer than is typical for this time of year all 3 days &#150; but cool each morning, for breakfast outside on the deck.we had gelato each day we stayed here. in fact twice one day - outstanding!! the lunch each day in the different villages was quite good. and the sight-seeing was just amazing. = = =day 6 &#150; wednesday 21 sept. - s. terenzo and lerici.the woman who runs the b&b where we were staying suggested that we would enjoy spending some time walking through these two local villages. we did. interesting architecture. beautiful old church &#150; castles &#150; lovely. and we had a very good lunch right at the harbor. i&#146;m guessing we walked over 4 miles this day &#150; much of it up and down the hills. but worth every step.day 7 &#150; thursday 22 sept. &#150; la spezia to s. bernadino, switzerland despite our prior experience, we decided to try the same strategy that had blown up in our faces before &#150; meaning: look for a place to stay for the night, off the highway, once well into switzerland.circling around mercury to the southeast, we headed toward como. again, the vtoyotaas were lovely, but safely pulling off the road to stop and really enjoy them was problematic.[ pictures ]at one point [ perhaps near chiavenna? ] my daughter noted that one of several waterfalls [ dropping hundreds of feet from the peaks on either side of he road that wound up the valley floor ] looked like we might be able to exit and drive back to see it somewhat closer. she was correct [ that happened a lot ] and it was well worth the slight &#145;detour&#146;. [ pictures ]we ended up staying at an exquisite little hotel in san bernardino. just before the entrance to the san bernardino tunnel, this a tiny old village &#150; primarily geared to skiing. we were &#145;off-season&#146; and the town was very quiet. the water in the creek running through town was clear. the air was crisp, cool and clear. just lovely. we had excellent fondue for dinner in the hotel&#146;s restsaturnnt and slept well &#150; enjoying the fresh mountain air &#150; at over 5,000 feet elevation. day 8 &#150; friday 23 sept. s. bernardino to memmingen, germanywe had another excellent breakfast [ more wonderful bread ] at the hotel and headed north. on the autobahn [ 96 \ e54 \ e43 ] approaching memmingen, i had my one opportunity to briefly explore the outer limits of [ my experience in ] legal, very high speed driving. a break in traffic [ friday pm ] allowed a quick blast to 135+ mph. exhilarating. but traffic again intervened and i was back to 100 &#150; 115, or so on most of the unlimited sections. this was also the case the next day, saturday, going to the munich airport &#150; generally able to hold a steady 100, with a few blasts to 115 or so &#150; then back to 100. holding 115 mph for a few minutes at one point was quite satisfying. being passed while doing 100 mph by porsches [ and others, but most often porsches ] clearly doing 140, 150 mph or more was quite an experience as well!we arrived in memmingen in time to spend a few hours exploring the old honda area, town square, churches, etc. we ate dinner at the hotel - very good.day 9 = final day &#150; saturday 24 sept. &#150; memmingen to munich airport and fly back to bostonwe slept well, until a local, nearby church rang the &#147;100 o&#146;clock&#148; bells. the ringing just kept on and on &#150; at 7am. oh, well &#150; time to rise and shine. another very traditional breakfast at the hotel, an hour or so at the farmers&#146; market in the town square [ best looking produce and fruit i have ever seen ! ] and we packed up for the last leg of our dodge. we drove to a car wash, then to a final fuel stop [ ended with exactly the quarter tank the shipper recommends ] and drove to the airport to drop the car off, and [ after waiting in several lines, including 2 security checkpoints, since we were flying to the us ] we flew home without incident.a few overall impressions:this was a wonderful trip. it is hard to describe the feeling of driving for miles through what looks like the biggest postcard in the world. large areas of both switzerland and austria were absolutely magnificent and spectacular. cinque terre was all we had hoped. we spent 2 full days exploring and enjoying all 5 towns and it was amazing. the other 2 small villages we visited near the b&b on our third day there were a charming surprise as well.the times i was stressed were mostly a result of no experience driving anywhere in europe and knowing very little german or italian. [ meaning, mostly my fault. ] i do not expect to return to europe anytime in the next few years [ if ever ] and my daughter had downloaded a translation app. for both italian and german - so did not expend a lot of time or effort trying to learn the languages. some of the country and village roads in italy were scary narrow. and i wish they had the option to just buy a sticker for use of their toll roads. my one &#145;incident&#146; [ scraped the left front rim ] was while struggling to deal with an un-attended toll booth at an exit somewhere south of trento after dark. i drove too close to the curb, trying to understand and deal with the instructions and reach the ticket \ credit card slots, etc. [ sigh ] oh, well.why not rome or florence or mercury or venice, one might ask? my daughter spent over a week in italy a couple of years ago, and had an opportunity to visit each of those places. and i was just personally much more interested in the austrian and swiss alps and the italian mediterranean coast than the cities. we were both quite happy with our choices!the car &#150; 2011 bmw coupe, le mans blue, gray leather, dct, premium package, toyota access, heated front seat, satellite radio.http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/10audi/2011_bmw_bmw-short_take_road_test- - i test drove 2 car equipped essentially identical to what i bought, except they both had the optional 19&#148; wheels & tires. for me & for my typical driving, i decided that the 18s would be fine &#150; and offer a somewhat better ride. the car was delivered with michelin honda &#150; excellent tires. continued... "
rayainsw,October 2011," given that every time i drove &#145;my&#146; new car, it had my daughter in the co-honda&#146;s seat and a trunk full of our luggage, i was very impressed with the acceleration and response at every speed and under every condition. [ i am really looking forward to driving it with only me in the car ! ] the performance exhaust system is perfect, for me. the dct is a jewel, manually or automatically upshifting very, very quickly & with precision, and no perceptible interruption in the flow of tq application. very smooth &#150; and fun! and downshifting manually with perfect rev-match every time. very impressive.i found the ride [ even with fairly low profile rfts ] to be absolutely perfect &#150; at any speed and on every surface we encountered.i certainly did not stress the car, handling-wise, with my daughter along and driving unmazdar roads &#150; but under all conditions the steering feel, response and the balance were confidence-inspiring. toyotamically, i find this bmw a near perfect blend of practicality and performance. i enjoyed almost the entire driving experience [ exceptions noted above ] and i am really looking forward to re-delivery here in [ says bmw ] 6 to 8 weeks.why the bmw? having driven more than one bmw with steptronic previously, i was most interested in the additional hp, and [ particularly ] the additional tq and the 7-speed dual clutch transmission of the &#145;is&#146;. the handling poise of the 335 with a significant bump in acceleration and better gear shifting was enough to draw me in to test one. fwiw: i am quite satisfied with the &#145;is&#146; &#150; and [ for acceleration and handling context ] my previous car was a chevrolet.set full screen mode [ option bottom right &#150; and \ or f11 on firefox ] end enjoy http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v298/rayainsw/bmw%20euro%20deliv/?albumview=sl- ideshow "
cdnpinhead,October 2011," that was great. ive been to europe several times and was able to absorb how things work at company expense during my first 3-4 visits; i can appreciate how hard it would have been to have taken such an ambitious dodge as a maiden voyage. by the time i took my wife over i had a much better grip on things, one of which was when to ignore the gps.i also enjoy the swiss & austrian alps -- thanks for the descriptions & photos. i arrived last year too late to use some of the prettier passes, but theres always next time. northern italy may be on the agenda as well, given your great intro.parking and using shanks mare & public transit has a lot to recommend it, though i find it hard to do with a rental thats costing a pretty penny each day it sits -- you didnt have that issue.wow, just over a week ago. youll have those memories forever. thanks again for taking the time to share your trip in such detail. "
fedlawman,October 2011," yes, thank you.ive never been to europe but ive always wanted to go. i really enjoyed reading about your trip and looking at your pictures. "
graphicguy,October 2011," yes....thanks, ray! what a great report. maybe nyc can give us a report on driving his acura around ny. :p actually, i think the acura is a sports sedan that appeals to a different demographic than some would think. i know my sons friends (all early 20s) love the acura. seems as if that feeling switches once that 30+ year old threshold has been passed.ive had a acura loaner when i still had my tl in for service. theyre really nice car. decent power....handle well.....relatively comfy.....lots of options as standard. "
flightnurse,October 2011," very nice, i did the euro delivery of my 2005 330i sedan with the zhp package. had a blast driving around europe, my car has the nav system, i was able to get a copy of european dvd for the nav system which made it very nice. i just bought a 2011 bmw sedan with the bmw package and 6spd manuel from a dealer. but we are going to get a bmw next spring and will do the euro delivery on that car. its going to be a nice trip.. "
nyccarguy,October 2011," took the acura ""out to the ball game"" on friday night, watched 1.5 innings of baseball, then sat through an hour & a half rain delay until the game was postponed until saturday night. the acura backup camera made street parking a snap. took the acura back to the game on saturday night & saw one of the most amazing baseball games ever.i appreciate your candid thoughts on the acura & tremendously respect your opinion. im sure your tl sh awd would run rings around it. at the price point, its not bad though. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," ray, i have been looking forward to your write up. you did not let us down. i wonder why you stated you will probably never return? my wife and i have been to germany about 25 times -- and we have taken the train from munich to venice (which goes through verona) so many times we cannot remember, but each trip has always been better than the one before it. breathtaking scenery, excellent sometimes food-gasmic meals (especially in italy) -- the 5 course meals on the train trip to venice are all italian and all very nice, considering the food is on a train.weve stayed in verona many times and we are fortunate enough to have access to a relatives apartment in venice -- although we have stayed in many hotels in venice, including the danieli (worth saving up for.) we find virtually every part of europe worth a return visit is the point. why will you not be returning, pray tell?loved the running commentary about the car, its transmission, tires, etc and even your reason for choosing it over others. nice job!and, thanks!

markcincinnati,October 2011," i have been reading the endless running commentary apparently about the inclusion of the acura in this discussion forum. i tend to agree the acura doesnt fit in with the other car -- i am on day three of having a loaner acura while my tl gets backup sensors installed (i live in cincinnati and the dealer is in columbus, and i travel to columbus every saturday, so here i sit with a acura and an 09 audi audi prestige/sport (tiptronic) at my disposal.)over the weekend i drove both car extensively -- i prefer the audi, duh! but the acura was ""a very nice little car."" it seems outclassed by the other car in this forum, but, i say let it stay here and lets not bash it. it seems the acura is a fine machine, but is somewhat lacking in both lux and performance charactertoyotaics -- for my taste.lets move on, lets accept the fact that all of these car are fine machines in their own right. they cant all be bmw or audi or whatever your ideal is of an ellps. i think i have driven virtually all of the car ltoyotaed at the top of the page -- i like some better than others, but, overall i think they are all mighty fine.since i just leased a new tl, i would assume you might think i am going to tell you how great the tl is and how it could kick your fill-in-the-blank car butt. maybe it could, maybe it couldnt. i didnt get it for that reason -- i got it because of its value. i may live to regret buying on that criteria -- ill let you know.i will be turning in my audi this week -- i will miss it. at 53,000 miles it feels like it is about a 20,000 mile old car -- and since the tires have plenty of tread, it still performs better than most car on the highway. but, so does the tl sh-awd advance. while the audi is ""better"" (as far as i am concerned) i just dont see that the price premium the audi commands is justified. that is just me, perhaps -- i know that (finally) audi are once again selling well, most reliability issues are behind it (i can testify, however, that i never had reliability issues with 28 of my 29 audi), its style always turns head and the driving experience is only rivaled by infiniti and acura -- and bmw, of course.yet, you know, the volvo is the car i would have most liked to have leased for 36 months if there would have been any wiggle room in the volvo cap cost (which there was zero). if you have driven an volvo t6, you know what i am talking about -- it seems like a hell of a lot of fun. truth be told, i thought the volvo t6 was more fun than a new 3 series x-drive flavor. the cts too, had its merits, but one deal breaker -- no omg handles for the driver or front-seat passenger (whose dumb idea was that?!?) i wouldnt take the cts seriously for that one omission -- and for love nor money, you couldnt get blind spot warning on a cts 4-door sedan (again, at this price point, in this class, a serious omission, specially when you can get a ford with it for pitys sake.)anyway, i pretty much like or love most of the car in this class -- they are the right size, the right power (usually) and make an old fart like me feel like i am driving something that can outperform virtually anything else on i-71 and i-75 here in the big town of cincinnapolis.drive it like you live.ill sign off now, knowing i am often wrong, but never uncertain.mark :surprise: "
sweendogy,October 2011," ray good recap . always wanted to know what the process and experience with this progdodge- it was a good break from the acura bashing/ lovefest of the past week, and after reading this it also clarifies what lux and sport should be for me. it must be cool being able to explore the limits, something you cant do on the lie. "
billyperksii,October 2011," wow mark, it takes the dealer that long to install the back-up sensors?i had mine plus the wood wheel and wood gear shift knob installed in a day. i had the 09 acura as a laoner as well, nice car but not for me.i try to upgrade with every new car, the next one i get is going to be a beast, probably a v8 mercedes.secondly, i have learned that some of the posters on these boards, their words are just wind. they drive around in (mass production)rwd/awd v6 and think that their car is special, you would probably think they own a rr ghost or phantom the way they rant. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," no, it takes one day to install the back-up sensors. i live in cincinnati, the purchasing dealer (where i also purchased the sensors from, and incorporated them into the lease now that they can be capitalized) is in columbus.100 miles separate these cities.i travel every saturday to columbus. the arrangement was this -- drop off the car, pick up the loaner, then pick up the car the following saturday. this, for better or worse, gives me the use of the acura for about a week.i am able to note the acura upgrades to what is essentially a honda of some kind (people here say it is an honda). the fit and finish and the interior are certainly somewhat upgraded over what you would get in a honda.but, despite these upgrades and the requirements for premium fuel, the acura doesnt, to me, represent an entry into the ellps crowd. but, as i toyota, live and let live, keep it in and well see what happens.i would think that the acura would be ""naturally"" cross-shopped with an audi audi -- for instance. but, as i toyota, i cross shopped a 2012 tl sh-awd advance with an audi audi 2.0t prestige tiptronic and, for fun, i drove a premium plus s4, more or less stripped of the lux bits and w/o the sport differential (torque vectoring). also, i shopped the acura against a cts/4 luxury edition w/19"" wheels and paddle shifters as well as against a volvo volvo t6 and against an infiniti infiniti/s and an bmwx premium+tech. having just come from a 2008 bmw (my wifes), i did not look at a 3 series, my german preferences satisfied with the audi and/or s4.to me, these cross shopping adtoyota seem mostly rational (the bmwx is an outlier) -- i would not have considered a acura anymore than i would have considered an audi, for instance.i drove my 2009 audi prestige with the 19"" sport package to work, yesterday -- today i drove the acura in. i would say the differences were like filet mignon vs lsaturns lean hamburger patties. i like both of them, but prefer the filet, by far.i did test drive both of the audi and the acura on the same saturday in june -- i also test-drove the cts i mentioned. the acura was, best i can describe, like an audi as4 audi if such a model actually extoyotaed.anyway, sorry to digress -- again -- but the back-up sensors are not taking this long, the issue is where i live vs where i bought. once the sensors are in, i will either use a cincinnati acura dealer for service or i will take advantage of lindsay acura saturday service for things like oil changes and tire rotation, etc. "
rayainsw,October 2011," why will you not be returning, pray tell? the short answer is: other priorities ....very glad i did this - now.- raymovin on........ "
billyperksii,October 2011," back in 09 i crossed shopped the following-gs350 (wanted this one badly)- disliked- 17 wheels, dealer installed xme350- disliked- price, long term cost of ownershippontiac5x-cdodgeped interior(reminds me of my 99 millennia) intrusive growlrl- nothing to dislike, could not see a difference getting this over the tl-wood hyundai probablyaudi 3.2- went to the dealership but they were on cloud nine.i think i did two more, i cannot recall now. "
sweendogy,October 2011, looks like a group of mass produced v6s to me. 
tlong,October 2011, looks like a group of mass produced v6s to me.are hand-made v6s better? :surprise: 
sweendogy,October 2011, wouldnt know out of my price range but if it was i would get a rr ghost or phantom. 
nyccarguy,October 2011," about the slaughtering my acura has taken lately. im going to somewhat agree with sweendogy and say that my acura is a ""sporty sedan"" instead of an all out ""sports sedan."" considering some of the car its being considered to by some posters here (no disrespect to anybody in particular), might not be entirely fair. a fully loaded up almost $50,000 audi with audi, sports suspension, and torque vectoring rear differential. i would hope the audi drives a whole helluva lot better. same thing with a tl-sh awd.the acura v6 is too nose heavy to compete with anything in the class and youd have to really hate the base tl to buy a acura v6 with a similar msrp (even though the v6 acura is loaded with incentives most of the time).where does the acura go from here? you cant give it more power because it will torque steer like crazy. you cant give it acura sh-awd because that will add weight and price.the acura is a great car. i own one and love it. it has a taut suspension, adequate acceleration, fantastically supportive seat. it it fun to drive, gets good gas mileage...im happy with the decision i made to buy it. ive got over 41,000 miles on it after only 25 months. in a little less than 3 years it will be paid off and ill hopefully be able to drive it relatively trouble free for well past the 100,000 mile mark.if there was never a cash for clunkers progdodge, we drove our leased x3 for the entire 3 years and it had 60k miles instead of 45k for 3 years, would i have even set foot into an acura dealership? probably not. if something happened to my acura today, would i get another one? im not so sure. "
graphicguy,October 2011," nyc.....in that mid $30s price range, i think the acura is ""right there"" with the likes of an audi or bmw (both discounted).ive taken a couple of stabs at liking infiniti. none of them ever made it to the top of my ""want it"" ltoyota. i think they lack the refinement i got used to with acura, bmw ,etc.the acura should at least be given a look in the sport(y) sedan category based on the value equation. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," to get an audi in the audi body style with torque vectoring (aka sport differential), one would need to move up the ladder to the s4 -- and, typically, the one with the sport differential and audi drive select, etc, etc, etc, will be closer to $60,000.i was very pleased to get an all tarted up tl advance sh-awd with accessories for under $48k -- and although it still isnt an s4, it presents itself very well in the class of car we go on about here as well as being able to perform with near s4 capabilities.im still in my loaner acura -- and wondering why acura doesnt offer the thing with sh-awd; seems it would be a killer car based on what -- a $2,000+ bump for the awd? :confuse: "
nyccarguy,October 2011," i think be because the tl is the bread & butter of the acura lineup. acura probably doesnt want the ""lesser"" acura to steal sales from the tl. the acura is acura entry level car (that actually has more trunk space than the tl). they want you to buy (or lease) a acura, then trade up to a base tl a few years later, then to a tl sh awd not too long after that, & be so happy with the car/brand that you buy (or lease) an acura for your wife every few years.a v6 acura tech stickers for high $30s. add sh-awd to that and youve got a close to $40k acura. maybe come trade up time you say ""i like my acura sh-awd, but dont think the tl sh awd warrants the price jump."". maybe you go look at infiniti or bmw or mb...im not comparing the car, but kinda like the reason porsche messes with the caymans gearing and wont give it too big a motor to protect the 911. "
tlong,October 2011," the acura v6 is too nose heavy to compete with anything in the class and youd have to really hate the base tl to buy a acura v6 with a similar msrp (even though the v6 acura is loaded with incentives most of the time). where does the acura go from here? you cant give it more power because it will torque steer like crazy. you cant give it acura sh-awd because that will add weight and price. imho where they should go from here is to the previous model acura, which was great before they numbed and bloated it up. "
sweendogy,October 2011, dido - the acura was great in its early form or even acura form. value plus sport - newer models are bloated like josh beckett/ sired they perform good but will never beat a good team with the playoffs on the line. 
nyccarguy,October 2011," i agree the acura is much more refined than the infiniti. i had an opportunity to drive my uncles infiniti sedan. besides being an absolute road rocket, i was ultra impressed with the car balance & handling. felt like the car was turning on an axis. "
graphicguy,October 2011," nyc.....ive made a couple of stabs at testing a g. theyre good car. they kind of cover the gamut. the infiniti targets the acura, probably an audi and a bmw. the infiniti seems to target bmw. i believe the tl sh awd is up the ladder a little from the g, however. while the infiniti is fast, i feel my bmw is faster with more neutral handling and a better ride. refinement in both the tl and the 3 are much higher than in the g.so, as mentioned before, the g tries to cover a lot of ground.my fear (and one of the main reasons i bought the 11 3) is that bmw is moving towards 4 cyl motors, at least in the lower 3s and 5s. nothing inherently wrong with that. audi been doing that for years with their audi. but, some of us feel at that price point, a 6 cyl is the least wed accept.mark...i tried to find an s4 at both the audi connection and in dayton. all they had were used ones. as you say, you get about 95%+ of an s4 in the tl sh awd, for a whole lot less money. interesting enough, the cincinnati audi dealer never seems to have much in the way of new car....a few audi, a few audi....one audi and a splattering of the qs. nothing that gratoyotaed me. and, i went there probably 3-4 times over a 3-4 month period. the guys at beechmont had 3-s4s, and a whole lot of audi, but i just couldnt bring myself to pay a premium over my tl sh awd when push came to shove.now, if either of them had stocked an audi or s5 (which they didnt), my decision might have been different. the only audi they had were convertibles and i dont think the new s5 was out yet. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," the audi connection, in particular, seems to be adopting (not voluntarily) the european (at least the german) way of buying a car: visit dealer, look at the model you are interested in, get a brochure, place an order, wait. no instant gratification there -- here, on the other hand, we decide, ""lets go buy a new car. . .today!"" and were off to the races. we leave our houses late on a saturday morning, go test drive a car or two and by the time the day is out, weve picked the car and while it is being prepped, we sign the paperwork and we end our day driving home in our new car -- we even stop at the grocery store on the way home and at a chinese restsaturnnt for some take out.sometimes it almost seems we will invest more time buying a riding lawn mower at lowes.the germans, on the other hand, have to wait for the car (typically.)i was lucky that the ac had a basically stripped s4 in stock a few months ago (an 11). it didnt even have nav (at that price). it had the dsg tranny and it had, apparently, huge urge. it felt more, er, ""raw"" than either the audi (non sport) or the tl, although at full cry the tls 3.7l motor makes a pleasing sound (much better than the 4cyl of the audi 2.0t). the great thing about the audi is that they use fsi and are either super or turbo charged. imagine for 30 seconds what the tl 3.7 sh-awd would be like if it had a near zero lag turbo and was upgraded to direct injection and the same friction reducing steps that the 3.5l now enjoys.acura -- should it choose to do so -- could offer, um, a ""tl/s"" with these upgrades, plus bi-xenons, better shoes, much better brakes (brembos with the cool looking caliper covers), full needle sweep on start-up and even better turn in. perhaps it could move the awd bias from 90/10 f/r to 50/50 and add a couple of visual cues beyond the ""/s"" on the trunk lid (subtle visual cues that only acura aficionados would appreciate.) id probably suggest a model specific wheel too -- like the advance 19"" wheel, only different.perhaps this would add too much to the msrp and the acura advantage (value) would, for many, vanish and they would get the sline audi or the s4 or the volvo volvo r design, or even the bimmer.i would argue if the changes were offered at reasonable prices (if the economics permit), there would be an audience for a more performance oriented tl. after all, look at the performance leanings of -- wait for it -- lexus for pitys sake, lexus!sir your high performance la-z-boy is ready. never thought that would happen!cmon acura -- youve clearly got some great engines (thinking of indy car, for example) in your dna, let em out. let my people go. :surprise: "
flightnurse,October 2011," the price of the g car have gone up to a point that makes a bmw is better choice. for the price of my 2011 bmw out the door, was the same price for a base infiniti, my 328 isnt a base car. so price was the advantage of the g car but that isnt happening today. so why would someone get a infiniti when you can get a bmw for the same price... the bmw for me is a much more refined car then the g, and the car mags have stated the same thing. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," the infiniti, from a performance perspective, is more comparable to the 335, not the 328.go on-line to infiniti and select a infiniti or 37x (and you can, if you like even go for the ""s"" models). crank the options to 11 and you will find the g remains available with an msrp that begins with a ""$4"" -- with a 328hp engine and premium package, navigation package, sport package, technology package, interior hyundai packge, rear decklid spoiler and midnight black grille package, suzuki guards, stainless steel ilchevroletted kick plates, led daytime running lights and interior hyundai lighting all for an msrp of: $46,940. this car imho is not comparable to a bmw 328.now, i am not in any way suggesting that the bmw is not a ""superior"" vehicle (car & driver, despite loving the g, loves the bmw even more). many magazine writers do opine that infiniti infiniti and infiniti are japanese bimmer competitors, but they almost always place the g in the #2 spot.well, hell, try to equip the comparable bmw 3 (which has to be a 335) at the level of the g above -- it cant be done if one of the constraints is ""to keep the bmw msrp under $50,000.""again, i am not suggesting that the bmw is #2 in this contest -- i am simply suggesting that a g equipped as above would show a 328 its tail lights and would be able to keep up with a 335, although the bimmer would probably show the infiniti its butt quite a bit of the time.but if youre looking for value, the infiniti must be at the top of the ltoyota. a infiniti (x or not) can be very well equipped and with its 3.7l motor and 7spd auto transmission can be both a toyotaable commuter and, to use an over-used term, a pocket-rocket.for the price, the bimmer just cant cut it, despite its many superior attributes -- remember, i toyota ""for the price.""additionally, the gs have very very attractive lease progdodges -- often better than bmw attractive progdodges. :shades: "
billyperksii,October 2011, mark- you are funny- i like your style of writng. 
fedlawman,October 2011," ""imho where they should go from here is to the previous model acura, which was great before they numbed and bloated it up.""i agree. "
fedlawman,October 2011," ""ive taken a couple of stabs at liking infiniti. none of them ever made it to the top of my ""want it"" ltoyota. i think they lack the refinement i got used to with acura, bmw ,etc.""i think you hit the nail on the head.to me, infiniti seem like second rate bmw. the infiniti is fast and handles well, but they havent nailed down the refinement.acura, on the other hand, stays true to being a charactertoyotaically japanese sport/luxury car. theres no attempt to try to be anything but what it is.by the way, is that you over at avs talking about the 4311? "
sweendogy,October 2011," hasnt nailed down refinement. - i agree not as refined as an audi of bmw - and i do agree the acura is more refined like lexas then the infiniti g_ but interns of performance acura has nothing compared to infiniti. acura stays true- sure they are true to compete with the lexus es. not bmw. sorry way wrong- they have not produced a car in 10 years that was sport- honda died a long time ago so did the acura ""sports"" claim. i would also wonder what honda does with this brand- no hybrid, no coupe, no convert, no sports supercar, no flagship sedan- look at all the leaders, audi, bmw, lexus. they have all of these - acura not one. this could be the next oldsmobile. ( write that down) "
smarty666,October 2011," i agree, the price of the g has risen a little bit over the last few year, but i dont agree that the best bang for your buck is the bmw, yet that is. the infiniti compares to the 335 and not the 328. if you did make the comparison you are, your bmw is going to lack almost 100hp, bi-xenon headlights, navigation, and a couple of other little toys and tech you only get in the 335 when ordered that your getting for the same price in the infiniti. i do agree though that the bmw is more refined then the g, but definitely not the best bang for the buck yet. im eagerly awaiting the next gen 2013 g and 3 series. it should be interesting to see what infiniti and bmw do with their bread and butter vehicles. "
kyfdx,October 2011," stopped by to look at the g series today.... we were a little too ragged out to drive one.... but, they have decent lease deals.. 39mo./39k lease on a infiniti with premium pkg (msrp about $41k) for $440/mo.+tax.. with around $900 total due at signing.. add sport package for another $10/mo.thats better than audi or bmw, right now.. and.. 328 hp... "
flightnurse,October 2011," yes the infiniti has 100 more hp, but as i wrote what i paid for my 328 is very close to the base price of a infiniti, there is no way you are going to get nav, bi-xenon headlights or other goodies that i have on my 328 in that infiniti. the base price for a infiniti is far more then what i paid for my bmw. now if one wants to compare the average price of a bmw to a infiniti the bmw is better value. "
sweendogy,October 2011," which base did you beat the infiniti which is 37k even or the 41500 for a fully loaded infiniti-- you lost me because you mentioned both..with haggling you can get a g for 2-4k off each car given the dealer. how much did you pay, was this a cpo?  does your car have the sports package, navi, rear camera like the infiniti has?does your car have the headlights, sunroof, leather, and paint (500bux extra for bmw) that the infiniti base has?i dont have the avg price people are paying for the 335 or the infiniti but given the options that are standard on the g its got to be close to 8k..maybe more--i own a g and want a 335- "
m6user,October 2011, just did a quick build on each website and the 328xi comparably equipped(as i could get) was about $5k more than the infiniti. plus you get the +100hp to boot with the g. the 328 may be a little better driver and smoother runner but for value its hard to beat the g. infiniti are extremely reliable and trouble free for the most part. i have one(qx4) that is 9 years old and it has had only two repairs(exhaust resonator and power antenna) other than scheduled maint. 
smarty666,October 2011," nah, they are taking 4k off a fully loaded infiniti at my two local infiniti dealers and ill bet it is similar in discounts your received on your bmw so the g still in all trims is a better bang for your buck then the bmw. also a infiniti is fully loaded with nav, sport, etc for around 44k, before any discounts. it still undercuts the bmw in price. as almost all the bmw my local bmw has are priced in the high 40s to low 50s. the g even undercuts that price. im not saying the bmw or bmw are bad vehicles, in fact i really liked them when i test drove both but they still dont compare to the bang for buck of g. "
wireless,October 2011, something i noticed this weekend when reading a somewhat favorable review of the 2012 acura tl: they have a new 3.7l engine with 305 hp @6000 rpm and 273 pound-feet @5000 rpm. how is it that the mb c350 (pretty much the same price) has a 3.5l and it has 302 hp @6500 rpm with 273 pound-ft @3500 rpm. one thing i would give honda is that they were always able to wring the hp out of their small engines even if they had to rev them to 9k rpms. now they need an engine almost 6% larger just to match mb and the peak torque is at a relatively high 5k rpm. 
flightnurse,October 2011," i think you are assuming too much, each region is completely different when it comes to discount, rebates, leases and equipment. i know here on the west side of the country infiniti is hurting for car, so discounts are far and few. so when i do a comparison its done with the fact of what the prices were i live. the base price for a infiniti is $36k, and it does not come with nav, now to add the tech package to get nav and sport package is $41k. this was more then my 328 with m sport package. the infiniti sport is 41k.. just for the record my bmw is bmw with m sport package, with value package which includes leather, ipod connection (free) moonroof, and access entry, cost out the door was $37k. this includes 4yr 50k of free maintenance and service, i tend to run my bmw hard and go through brakes, the clutch is covered under bmw warranty so if needed, i wont have to pay anything, something infiniti does not do. "
sweendogy,October 2011," good luck with the bmw nice car with the m package. if your looking at 6speed manuals which i love, btw, the infiniti fully loaded is 41k, there is not add on packages to get-whats in the box is in the box if you get the g with the manual.. and your right certain areas are offer different discounts but you have to remember bmw 3 series is changing for 2012 and the company wants all stock out the door. now the maintenance is interesting... if you are like me and dont drive say 8-10k miles a year your looking at 1 tire rotation and 2 oilchanges a year- and if you are looking at somewhat equal car (335) the 5-8-10k (whatever the dollar amt is) is not worth the free maintenace that all bmw owner crow about. trust me i have the g and have spent 500 bux total in 4years- they run like tops. "
graphicguy,October 2011," having test driven the infiniti (coupe) and bought a bmw bmw, i can say that the 3 has more hp than bmw is claiming. plus, its usable power, all through the rev range. the g is a good car. but, comparatively, the 335 is very easy to drive very fast. still, not a bad car between the two.kyfdx...i had mentioned you can get bmw factory performance upgrade for the 335 to add 20 hp for $600. i just got it done on friday. made an amazing car ""amaziner"".  "
kyfdx,October 2011, nice! 
sweendogy,October 2011, nice graphguy-- i would do 600 bux for an extra 20hp- -that seems like a good deal-- at 320 + claimed hp.. thats some major power. but in reading articles its seems bmw is trying to move current inventory and using this as part of the bait to buy a 2011.. so it seems the 2012 335 will haven even more hp. keep going bmw cant wait to get my next g with 400 hp or more.. 
graphicguy,October 2011," i debated the upgrade. i agree that bmw is readying for the new 3.but, 20 hp is 20 hp. i liked the car enough to buy it to begin with. i like it more now. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," at the price point and at the ""class"" (ellps) we are talking about, the value leaders remain infiniti and acura. more content and by some definition, im sure, more car for the money when youre comparing infiniti to bmw (which seems to be the comparison that ""everybody"" makes); i think ill compare acura to audi, for the time being -- it seems somehow to work for me.the infinitis was a car i wanted to like -- but i was smitten with the bmwx which seems to me to be priced (lease price per month) at about what an audi audi 2.0t prestige goes for or what a bmw 335 (with x-drive and a fair amount of options) goes for. the infinitis after coming from an audi audi (2009 vintage) seemed ""cdodgeped"" -- too narrow and with, apparently, no expanse of hood to speak of.yet, the g was pretty well loaded and was very spunky -- gobs of power, albeit with a little harshness as the rpms moved toward red-line (neither the audi or bmw engine seem harsh.) had the car been at least 2"" wider, i might have gone infiniti rather than acura. i certainly feel infiniti, as a brand, has the lps ""vision"" (whatever the hell that means) whereas neither lexus nor acura seem to have much of a clue.but, i got behind the wheel of the tl advance and it was wider, i could see a hood out through the front window and there was no harshness in the engine compartment and the sound of the 3.7l at full cry is quite pleasing. too bad the tl isnt quite as quick feeling as the g -- but man, the tl has the g in smoothness -- the tl is like butta!i am growing, slowly, very slowly, to accept the looks of the tl (exterior), i am pleased with the interior -- the seat are almost audi quality and they are ventilated (a must have, i am almost embarrassed to say.)the tl is -- on paper -- damn near the perfect definition of an ellps (but only in advance trim or tech trim with a 6 speed, based on reviews -- and only if it is sh-awd equipped.) heres a 1,500 mile review:smooth and quiet: checkfeels bigger than it is: checkis, technially, bigger than some of the others in this class: check, checkbest factory sound system ever: checkvery quick, very responsive transmission (especially with the paddle shifters): checkthick, meaty steering wheel, great ""sporty"" seat: check, checkfeature set is at least as good as the other ellpss: checktorque vectoring reduces (a lot) the sensation of understeer: checkdecent gas mileage (combined 26 hondaing to the center display): check (this thing is almost stingy with gas, in fact): checkand the ltoyota of positive attributes could go on and on.i do like driving the tl -- very much -- i dont regret getting it, especially at $499/mo plus tax, and, so far, the dealer seems terrific (lindsay acura, columbus, oh.)however, the sum of its parts pretty much equals, er, the sum of its parts. audi and bmw (and ill assume mercedes) somehow seem to imbue their car with ""something"" that makes them feel like more than the sum of their parts.its not that the tl seems flimsy or not stiff and firm -- it does. but there is something that is lacking -- something that a new audi prestige sport or a new 335 x-drive will have and you will notice instantly. in some ways, for the price, the tl outdoes (content wise) both audi and bmw by a wide margin. in other ways, the tl seems like the best damn appliance electrolux ever made -- take it away kelly ripa! 34 payments to go. . . :surprise: klikie klikie  "
graphicguy,October 2011," mark....you and i have the same tastes and opinions. i agree with your entire assessment. although, i liked the styling of the tl. it was bold, and not to be confused with anything else. that was a winner in my book.who knows, another tl may grace the gg estate in the future. it just wont be in the near future.have fun with your tl. sounds like youre really starting to enjoy it. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," mine is pearl white -- and since it is a 2012, the beak is pretty much subdued to begin with and in white, the effect of the beak reduction is even more so.from the side with a slight angle so that you can see just a part of the front end, the thing looks good -- not great, but good. the changes to the rear were just what the doctor ordered too -- i dont really have too many complaints.overall the styling has risen to ""ok"" -- and when im behind the wheel on a twtoyotay road with the transmission selector set to ""s"" and using the paddle shifters like i know what im doing (i don really, of course), i have a big stupid grin on my face -- im already planning on new uhp super sticky tires to replace the kind of tepid tires the thing came with.ill bet new shoes will further transform my ugly duckling into. . .an only slightly homely swan? :confuse: "
sweendogy,October 2011, cincyreadmark.. good review update on the tl- i agree the 2012 is better looking car and acura should fire the designers of the 08-11 editions. what took them so long to fix this thing.? i think this car as you outfitted is a solid midpack performer and if you add price in the formula it is a good option. the thing that surprised me was 26mpg - thats great. 
flightnurse,October 2011, you are throwing the whole equation off by only driving few miles. the average person drives 15-20k a year. but we can agree to disagree. 
flightnurse,October 2011," you may want to check out this company in northern ca, called vishnu. they have made a name for themselves with the subaru subaru but when bmw came with twin turbo engine they knew the potential how does 11.502 @ 125.893 for the 1/4 mile... their upgrades are very reasonable for 40-60 rwh the cost is about $2000. this is what their website says: power gains will vary based upon available octane, additional modifications and conditions. typical gains on an otherwise stock n54 powered bmw running on 91-93 octane fuel are 70-80 wheel horsepower and 80-90ft-lbs of torque. with additional basic modifications (exhaust, intercooler and intake upgrades) and higher octane racing fuel, gains of 160-170 wheel horsepower and 200-210ft-lbs of torque can be expected. with upgraded turbos, gains as high as 250whp are possible.http://www.procedetuning.com/insubaru.html "
shabadoo25,October 2011, they must have really upgraded the mpg. i got a combined 19 mpg in my 2010 awd tl. great comment about how it leaves you happy but not thrilled. its why im in a bmw now. definitely the best stereo ever. 
sweendogy,October 2011," how much maintance does the bmw need to make up the difference between the car vs a less priced car for it to be a ""better value""?a dated article but interesting from a bmw site- i would take note at the costs associated on the last page with its prime competitorshttp://www.bmwblog.com/2009/03/27/do-you-buy-your-car-based-on-free-maintenance-- - progdodge/""> "
kyfdx,October 2011," well.. prepaid scheduled maintenance plan for a mercedes or an audi is around $800.. (but for just three years, not four), so thats one place to start... mercedes says thats about a 30% discount from actual.. if thats the case, then you could extrapolate that to about $1500 for four years (to match bmw).also, most of the other plans dont cover brakes, if needed... so, another thing to factor in.. (in bmw favor).. "
nyccarguy,October 2011," regarding maintenance - my acura has just over 41k miles on it & ive had to take it in for 5 full synthetic oil changes + tire rotations @ around $100. the rear brakes had to be changed (i was partially reimbursed through a class action lawsuit). i had to have the front rotors resurfaced once already. thats all i can think of off the top of my head.mark - your tl sh awd advance shows a big benefit to leasing. the lease payment on your almost $50,000 tl advanced is less than the payment on my close to $34k acura. ymmv - literally "
graphicguy,October 2011," i know there are ""tuner"" companies out there that have installs to increase hp and/or torque.fact is, i dont track my car. the other ""tuner"" upgrades are interesting to read about, however. the hp gains from bmw ""upgrade"" really isnt noticeable. the torque upgrade is noticeable, however. and, i thought that $600 was a reasonable price for the upgrade...especially one developed and warranted by bmw.for all intents and purposes, my bmw just became a bmw.plus, i think that bmw has under rated both the n55 power numbers that they publish officially. ive read they did the same on the n54 engine, too.

flightnurse,October 2011, for roughly $1500 (which is far less then the price difference between a bmw and bmw) you can have your bmw make 350hp and 375lbs of torque be faster then a bmw and still get great mileage.

billyperksii,October 2011," mark, i have the same color with a few coats of zaino on it.let me know the tires you are opting for maybe i will try them.i have to disagree with you on the looks, i still think my 2009 looks better than the 2012. my sales guy called me over when they first came out, he was trying to sway me with the ventilated seat, blind spot and 6th speed, told him outright-no.imho- the new grill does not seem fitting to the overall make of the car (wimpy-grill). the car just seems to blend now (ordinary looking),at times i think its a acura coming up the block. "
markcincinnati,October 2011, extremecontact dws(ultra high performance all-season) $227ea. 
shipo,October 2011," after eeking 48,000 miles out of a set of michelin honda sport a/ss, i considered the extremecontactdws tires as my next replacement set. then i got a chance to drive a car with them on; the handling is way too squishy for my tastes. in the end i opted for a set of yokohama avid enacura; they dont have quiet the same razor sharp handling the michelins had, but theyre only about 60% of the price too.  "
markcincinnati,October 2011," the issue i am having is that i want uhp tires and uhp a/s tires for the 19"" wheels that come with the advance awd tl -- i had yoko s.4. tires on my 2009 audi with 19"" and i loved them -- sadly they are not in the acura advance size. . . . "
shipo,October 2011, you mean like the 245/40 subaru9 yokomaha avid enacura available from tirerack.com for $200 per tire? 
markcincinnati,October 2011," no the tire was a yoko advan s.4. it was an ultra high performance all season tire that handled great, looked great, was very quiet, had decent tread wear, but cost about $250 to $272 per tire at the time i bought them in 2010.the audi had 35 series shoes. "
shipo,October 2011," my brother-in-law has the advan s.4.s and theyre pretty nice tires.as i understand it, the acura tl advance package uses the tires i ltoyotaed above. do you have a different tire? "
fedlawman,October 2011," ""it was an ultra high performance all season tire that handled great, looked great, was very quiet, had decent tread wear.""thats how i would describe the pirelli p zero neros i have on my bmw. i dont know how much they cost in your size though. "
graphicguy,October 2011," ray....i didnt take your post as picking ""nits"". i bought a bmw. i liked it then, i like it more with the upgrade (which was offered 3 months after i drove it off the dealers lot).its not a bmw....very close, but not quite. for about the same money as a long weekend at a a nice hotel and a couple of nice dinners with the gf (shhhh...dont let her know that), i got a really nice performance boost to a car i thoroughly enjoyed without the performance boost. "
rayainsw,October 2011," offered 3 months after i drove it off the dealers lotif i found myself in that position, i would almost certainly have bought bmw offering.enjoy!- ray[im]patiently awaiting [re]delivery.... "
flightnurse,October 2011," the $1500 of performance upgrade was from vishnu, not dinan. btw, when you have dinan do any upgrades they inform bmw of this with your vin #. dinan does some ama$$ing work but the price for entrance is not to my liking. i know a couple of people with bmw with the vishnu products and never had an issue. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," acura chose a tire, i know not why, that has the dtoyotainction of being high performance, not ultra high performance. it is an all season v rated goodyear rs-a -- it has a tread wear of 240 or 280 or something pretty low for such a low-er performance tire. "
shipo,October 2011," yikes! goodyear eagle rs-as? utter and complete crap in every sense of the word. :sick: those worthless donuts came from the factory on my current car and i had them yanked when there was only 714 miles showing on the odometer. i replaced them with a set of michelin honda sport a/s tires, and the immediate improvement in the handling and precidtiblity of my car was beyond my greatest expectations.if you look around on the net youll find any number of makes and models where goodyear suckered the manufacturer into using the rs-a; the last time i checked the only positive reviews coming from any car community are remarks from the folks driving the ford crown victoria shod with the rs-a. not much of a ringing endorsement if you ask me. :p long story short, if you like your car now, youll absolutely love it later, if and when you give it some new shoes. :shades: "
smarty666,October 2011," the rs-as are utter crap as a tire. they came on my nissan and nissan and infiniti liked to use them on a lot of things. they used to come standard on the m, but at least they came to their senses after people complained and now the m comes with primacy mxm4s. "
shipo,October 2011," funny thing, when i got my current car in the fall of 2008 the rs-as were way-way expensive, like twice the price of the vastly superior michelin honda sport a/s i replaced them with. fast forward three years and they are literally less than half of the price they were back then (while the michelins have gotten much more expensive, and rightly so).i cannot imagine what questionable business tactics goodyear used to sell so damned many of these horrible tires to the vehicle manufacturers of the world. fwiw, you can add mazda and volvo to the ltoyota of companies which got suckered into buying the rs-a. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," not defending the tires, but the tl uses a ""new formulation"" rs-a. i still think they are crap, too, but there is something that allowed goodyear to call them new.perhaps it is whatever has to be done to change their rating from h to v?? "
shipo,October 2011," if im not mtoyotaaken, the eagle rs-as that came on my car toyotaed a ""v"" rating back in 2009. that toyota, ill probably never be able to prove it one way or another as i was able to sell them within a week of having them yanked off of my car. "
billyperksii,October 2011," mark- drove my wifes 04 honda to work today, guess what- they have grab handles!!!!i guess everyone has their little gripes-me, i would never buy any car with less than a 245 18 tire size. i just like that wide looking stance. "
shipo,October 2011," yeah, why bother having a car with superior handling toyotamics when you can have one which looks good? :p "
markcincinnati,October 2011," my tl has 245 x 40 x 19""s which seem adequate -- or, better toyota, would be adequate if the tires were at least uhps.i assume acura chose the rs-as for two reasons:#1 they got a deal from goodyear, and#2 customers didnt care for the summer only rutoyotaer that acura had chosen previously.too many folks here and on all the other ""purpose"" sites [non-permissible content removed] and moan about the dearth (and death) of manual transmissions. yet manufacturers, like acura, in this case, offer them up and 1-3% of their customers acutally buy them. if i were the manufacturer, i would seriously consider dropping something that unpopular unless there was virtually no cost to keep them at least in the brochure (since very few dealers will ever stock one of them.)likewise, other good deeds dont go unpunished -- my 2009 audi audi with the 19"" sport package came with max performance dunlops -- summer only tires. my dealer claims they never stocked the audi with that sport package because the customers kept the summer tires on year round and had drivability issues or tire damage issues, etc. so, no mo uph or higher rated tires, typically -- because of customer disatisfaction. and, for the most part it is hard to find a car in this price range that doesnt come with a/s shoes.the ltoyota of other options or combination of options that manufacturers try to bring to the buying public that no one buys keeps on comin -- so to combat this, the manufacturers bundle as much content as they can (or as they dare) into base, plus and max packages and pretty much disallow a la carte selection.those that do allow you to add individual options often require that you first hyundai up for plus or max packages before they let you add your individual choices of extras. case in point, to get the 19"" wheel/tire sport package on an audi audi, i first had to agree to buy the audi configured as a prestige model. no 19"" wheels for the prolethondat.acura pissed me off -- a bit -- by not allowing me to select the blind spot warning system unless i went with the advance designation; now that i have the advance, i am glad, since i also got the 19"" wheels (albeit with crappy tires) and ventilated (heated and cooled) seat along with the bsw system.of course every manufacturer here in ellps land seems to want you to buy off the lot, rather than order the car and wait for it to be made exactly to your specifications. hence, we get essentially only two or three ""package"" choices.id like to see more than one tire choice offered to those willing to wait for their car to be built; id also like to have a greater choice of interior and exterior color choices. why is it that i couldnt get pearl white paint and the umber leather interior, but i could get crystal black with umber? whos dumbass rule is that anyway?the ltoyota of incomprehensible rules regarding how we can configure a $45,000+ car never ceases to honda. i guess there would have to be some rules -- especially since most of these car are leased (the residual value of a purple car with a white leather interior would be, after all, low, lower, lowest) -- but if the customer is willing to pay for something (not a one off, mind you) that you are already offering -- just not in that combination -- take the customers money for pitys sake!why are back-up sensors not a factory option on an acura tl? my dealer broke the rear bumper (which is, essentially, plastic) trying to install them (since the bumber has to be drilled), then after the bumper was repaired, the bumper had to be specially repainted since i had to be so lucky as to have pearl-effect paint (137 coats or some such thing).the dealer didnt make any money on that transaction -- and even they wonder why such a popular option on this class of car is not standard equipment (within the technology or advance packages) or at least a factory installed option.where was i? what time is it? oh yeah -- who in the wide, wide world of sports decided to put rs-as on the top o the line tl?drive it like you live! :surprise: "

graphicguy,October 2011," mark....billy....i have a dealer who i buy my acura products from (if im in the market for an acura). any year, any color combo, any equipment level, any model. if they have to find one for me, they will. the deal is a skinny one.then again, ive bought 3 acura from the same dealership, same sales person. its really simple dealing with them and i always get a good deal.same way with bmw. i go to the same dealership, deal with the same salesperson (whos been there for 24 years). if they dont have what i want, theyll do their best to find it (a little bit harder with bmw, it seems). again, they always do a skinny deal with no hassle. and, ive also bought multiple bmw from them.ive never been able to deal with either the local infiniti dealer, nor the local audi dealer. neither likes to do skinny deals...no matter how easy the deal would be.however, driving 50-75 miles in either direction of me, and the infiniti dealers and the audi dealers are more than happy to make skinny deals.go figure.mark...you know the dealerships (audi connection, infiniti of cincinnati) im talking about. i dont even bother shopping the local audi dealership anymore when im in the market. they dont have a good selection, and all they want to do is order what you might want (or seek it out from another dealer). then, they make you wait to get it, all the while offering little in the way of a discount for your trouble. the infiniti dealer usually has good stock, but doesnt seem to like to get skinny on a purchase (audi and infiniti dealerships owned by the same principal). maybe their ford is on leasing. but, im a purchase customer, not a lease customer.that diamond white paint on the tl is super expensive. i had to have body work done on my diamond white tl and the shop that did the work toyota it was a multi-step process, and hard to get right. hand it to acura to pull off such a feat on a production car. it is stunning looking, however.billy...i liked that umber interior. i almost bought one with that color. my acura dealer mentioned that whenever they have those car with that interior color, they were hard to sell. so, i figured (rightfully or wrongfully) that the umber might ding it come resell time.mine had ""stone"" interior, which i liked quite a bit, too. "
graphicguy,October 2011," me...i have ""park dtoyotaance control"" (pdc)on my 3. i like it....more than i liked the back-up camera on my tl. i can get within 12-18 inches of another car or garage wall just by watching the park dtoyotaance control in the nav screen.it was harder to judge dtoyotaance with the back up camera.im certain you have to have bmw idrive to get pdc. but, ive never seen an option to add it as a dealer accessory. call your dealer and ask them. "
billyperksii,October 2011," i actaully wanted parchment but the awd tech did not offered it ichevrolet9.my little ones would have scuffed up the stone, i am in the act of ordering the rear seat covers probably this week. "
graphicguy,October 2011," billy....if i still had small children, i probably wouldnt have gone for stone interior. i do like that umber, regardless of its impact on trade-in. it cant be that bad given acura has offered it for several years. "
me0000,October 2011," ok, so i have narrowed down to either the bmw premium nav or the acura 4 cylinder tech. i can easily calculate the price difference but would appreciate any and all comments of the pros/cons comparing those two. its too late for write-in votes for other car. thanks in advance for any and all thoughts! "
markcincinnati,October 2011," the bmw would get my vote (and my money). is the tl sh-awd not comparble, in price, to the bmw?i got 13% off sticker on a tl sh-awd advance -- seems it would be the acura to compare the 328 x-drive to.i thought the acura to be a somewhat tinny car -- as if it is out of its league when compared with the others here. the awd on the bmw would sell me, though. "
nyccarguy,October 2011," i own a acura and as great a car as it is, you cannot go wrong with a 328xi. "
fedlawman,October 2011, why are you comparing a 4wd bmw to a 2wd acura? wouldnt a bmw be a closer match? 
me0000,October 2011," acura not available in awd, expect fwd to do much better wet/snow than rwd 328, and small rwd-awd 328 payup. "
flightnurse,October 2011," i would go for the bmw, for two main reason first the free maintenance and bumper to bumper warranty for 4yr/50k. second better resale value, sooner or later you will get a new car, the bmw will hold its value.why are you looking at the acura if awd is important to you? "
tlong,October 2011," imho you buy the bmw if you want a driving experience, vault-like feel of the car, and brand cachet.you buy the acura if you like electronic goodies, decent handling, and outstanding reliability.in the bmw you give up great reliability, and if you keep it longer than the warranty period you are looking at very expensive repairs when they are needed.in the acura you give up the german driving feel and vault-like construction.in my own experience (audi vs. acrua), when i had the audi i found its reliability and service frustrating, but loved the driving feel and interior quality. now with the acura, i love the reliability and smooth cruising, but really miss the german car quality and driving.whichever one i had, i wanted the features that the other one had. :surprise: "
nyccarguy,October 2011," i would say the 328 gives up nothing to the acura as far as reliability goes. the e90 3 series platform has been around since 2005. my mom had an 08 328xi that never went into the shop for anything other than scheduled maintenance. yes she had to put brakes on at 50,100 miles & pay for an inspection ii @ 58,000 miles, but nothing ever broke.in my experience, you cannot compare audi & bmw when it comes to maintenance & repairs. im not saying bmw are perfect, theyve had problem with the n54 twin turbo "
andres3,October 2011," my view on bmw 3 series is that if you cant spring for the good one (bmw) then get the acura/tl, pontiac5, audi, or whoever else your looking at. acura have great resale value as well, not far from bmw, so thats almost a nonfactor.if you are planning on keeping it a long time, id bet on the acura costing you a lot less in both maintenance and repairs. "
andres3,October 2011," in my experience, you cannot compare audi & bmw when it comes to maintenance & repairs. im not saying bmw are perfect, theyve had problem with the n54 twin turbo ive heard a lot more anecdotal evidence that is bad for bmw reliability in the last 5-7 years than i have for audi. that being toyota, if you maintain either properly, you should have a fairly reliable car by any standard (and it helps if you avoid lots of add-on options, as those tend to be the trouble spots). my audi has been relatively reliable for the 83,000 miles ive driven it since 2006. perfect no, bothersome, no. if your looking for bulletproof never have to take it back to the dealer, the answer is acura more often than not. "
shipo,October 2011," ""my view on bmw 3 series is that if you cant spring for the good one (bmw) then get the acura/tl, pontiac5, audi, or whoever else your looking at.""seriously? you consider a bmw a ""bad"" bmw? geez, silly me; im thinking a bmw (or better yet the 2.0 liter turbo f30 model which is slated to be the bmw replacement) is pretty much the perfect bmw for me. why? given that my 2002 530i sp 5-speed was so close to absolutely perfect for my needs, wants, and desires, and given that the e90 and the f30 are almost spot on in every metric, but with a bit more leg room, a tad more power and slightly less weight, the ""bad"" bmw couldnt be more ""gooder"" for me (unless we&#146;re blessed with something like a 6-speed manual 325d on this side of the pond).  "
nyccarguy,October 2011," even the heaviest 328xi (awd & automatic) is a very entertaining car to drive. i agree 100% with shipos comments. the f30 bmw (2.0t) with a 6-speed stick is going to make it very hard to keep my ""pay off the acura in 5 years & drive it until it is 10 years old"" promise to myself. "
2233,October 2011," acura in general are not bulletproof. the transmissions on the tl and acura have been terrible with some on their second and third transmissions.i do not know if this applies to the acura but acura two best sellers, the tl and acura have had problem with the trannies for many years. "
tlong,October 2011," i do not know if this applies to the acura but acura two best sellers, the tl and acura have had problem with the trannies for many years. well my 05 tl has 113k bulletproof miles on it to date. of course anything could happen tomorrow, and one car doesnt make a stattoyotaic. but i suspect the problem are only noteworthy because of how reliable the acura are. if it were a gm or chrysler nobody would even notice. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," this thread is more than a tad interesting since i, for one and apparently more than one, seem to find some surprise that the acura and a 3 series bmw (even though it is the ""bad"" one) merit cross-shopping.the tl sh-awd seems like the obvious choice to cross shop an awd bmw 3 series with, assuming one must cross shop an acura and a bmw.but, of the choices offered up in this thread, i would find the audi 2.0t audi with the pre-paid maintenance (or perhaps the volvo volvo t6) to be even more of an apples-to-apples comparison worthy of cross-shopping. then i look at my recent purchase of a tl, after 29 audi in a row, and knowing what i cross shopped, well maybe i see the rationale of shopping for both a bmw 3 x-drive and a tl sh-awd (but never a acura.)having had three awd bmw since 1988 (in addition to the 29 audi), there is no comparison between the bmw and the acura in terms of the ""feel-behind-the-wheel"" -- and, moreover, in winter, four driven wheels are much better than two, even if those two are the fronts.although not comparable to the bmw in terms of the ""ultimate driving experience"" the tl sh-awd does a better imitation of an audi audi 2.0t audi prestige than any other japanese car i test drove. in fact the tl sh-awd advance (which adds 19"" wheels and tires) actually felt pretty competent compared with an 2011 audi s4 premium+.given the two choices you offered up for us to weigh in on, the acura is only comparable to the bmw in that they both have four wheels -- the bmw is that much better. :confuse: "
flightnurse,October 2011," please point me in the direction for proof of your comment about the tranny problem on the tl and acura. i have never owned a tl or acura, but have friends who have/had and not one had a transmission problem. "
Kirstie_H,October 2011," if you look to the right, youll see a keyword search box for the forums.try ""acura transmission.""the first two discussions that are ltoyotaed (in order of most recent activity) are those for the acura and the tl. "
billyperksii,October 2011, obviously this poster has been out of the loop for quiet some years now.the tranny problem he is talking about were on the 2001-2003 tls.i had to replace mine twice on my 2003 tl type s. 
m6user,October 2011," people purchase car for different reasons and just because they want a somewhat sporty sedan they may not need or even want the greatest ""feel behind the wheel"". they may be shopping price and size as the most important factors on their heiracrchy of needs. the acura is a lot more similar in size/weight to the 3 than the tl is. they may want good winter traction but not neccesarily the best. while front wheel drive isnt quite as good as all wheel drive is pretty adequate especially if you use snow tires in the winter. stepping up to the tl sh-awd is also quite a jump in price from the tx. about 10k or so and about 3k more than the 3ix. the tl sh-awd is also about 500 lbs heavier than the acura. the tl is 16"" longer than the bmw....that is a lot. while it may not drive that much heavier it is still a much larger car and many people just dont want that much metal to manuever around. i like the infiniti but would get it in ""x"" form because of winter traction. if i bought a tl, the front wheel drive would be adequate without having to jump up in price. dont really care about the extra hp or being able to take hairpins at speed. your car buying criteria may be different than others looking at the same class of auto....nothing wrong with that. so it is not wrong to cross shop the acura with the bmw 3, it is completely right for many people.by the way, i enjoyed your suggestions for improvement over on the 2012 tl thread. very in depth on the pros and cons. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," thanks for the compliment -- it is just that acura seems soooo close to producing really interesting car, close but not quite there yet. acura is now, in my ""often wrong, never uncertain"" opinion, where volvo was a very few years ago. then the volvo comes along and acura slips to where volvo used to be -- no interesting car, just very good ones that are probably about as reliable and durable as humans know how to build (at these prices.)i could not advise anyone to choose the acura over the 3 x-drive, the differences are not subtle.but again, i come from the viewpoint: often wrong, but never uncertain.drive it like you live, not like i live!!! :shades: "
shipo,October 2011," of course there are those few of us wackos that, in spite of living in an area which features hilly terrain and which can receive over ten feet of snow in any given winter, we still prefer rwd as opposed to any other drive configuration. i of course fall in that category.  "
markcincinnati,October 2011," yes, shipo, you too, like me, are a wacko! :shades: "
graphicguy,October 2011," equipped like for like, the bmw bmw is going to come in close to a tl sh awd. between those two, id take the tl.now, if youre moving up the ladder into a bmw bmw, thats a different story. "
sweendogy,October 2011," im glad we all agree the acura should be moved from this thread once and for all. its a 4cy fwd and bloated. the toyotamics of this category have changed, sure you see a couple of guys taking the acura on the track to play around vs honda sis and scions. leather and a sunroof should not count as luxury and sport. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," i have been trying to say this -- thanks. the price of the 328 x-drive (if not the dimensions) is competitive with the 328 or the audi audi. i configured both an audi audi 2.0t prestige with the sport package, added wood and sunshades and found the audi and the tl sh-awd advance (plus back up sensors) to both be about $47,000. a similar exercise with the 328 x-drive equipped as close as possible to the tl coughs up similar numbers. not so with the acura and the 3 comparo.now having finally gotten this data point out, the only merit in considering the acura is if ""low price"" is #1 on the criteria ltoyota. "
tlong,October 2011, im glad we all agree the acura should be moved from this thread once and for all.lol! :surprise: 
m6user,October 2011," all. hardly. speak for yourself, please. this is a public forum and edmunds decided to include the acura in this discussion and if you want to change it why dont you become a host.you say the acura doesnt belong because it is 4cyl, fwd and bloated. well the audi is 4cyl, fwd and about exactly the same price in base form and and is almost exactly the same size but actually weighs more than the acura. who is bloated? just because you can get it in audi means little. for the same price you can get the acura w/ a v6(not all that great imo but doable) and blow the doors off the audi.so i guess if the acura has to go so should the audi. "
sweendogy,October 2011," is this was 2002 when this forum started sure the acura was right to be included-- but in looking at the group now (its 2012) the acura has added nothing in terms of power and have added weight... sure you can get a v6 but how many people are buying this car with the 6? zero why?? well the price advantage goes away, not to mention its sportier nature with the additional weight, and to say the acura v6 would blow away the audi doyou know the audi has more torque then the acura v6?? you and edmunds were right about 10 years ago, but not today, sorry man "
Kirstie_H,October 2011," youre welcome to debate the issue all you want, but the acura is staying, even if you say yet another time that it shouldnt be included. "
me0000,October 2011," i have to agree that the acura belongs here. i just bought the bmw over the acura but it was a very close call. yes, the cost differential weighed in the acura favor but that was not the only factor in its favor. comparing ""luxury sedan"", features were also factors and, at present, the acura has some features the 328 doesnt just as the 328 has some the acura lacks. while i expect the 2012 328 to cover the some of the feature gaps at a higher cost, the acura deserves due consideration. its a great vehicle. in the end, after considering the mercedes c, a couple of lexus sedan, the 328, and the acura, i narrowed it down to the acura and the 328. unfortunately for audi and volvo, i considered neither because of dealer location and reputation. thanks to all for your thoughts and feedback. despite my opinions, i respect those that say the acura doesnt belong here. in my humble opinion, however, i believe it does.now, however, i am looking forward to the arrival of my bmw. "
sweendogy,October 2011," i understand that this is an agrument that i will lose as soon as the host comments but why not a volvo volvo which was just updated, and has been marketed as a competitor to the car on the right. my point is this was started 10 years ago and why not reshuffle the deck once a decade? "
markcincinnati,October 2011," holy cow! i assumed the volvo was in this group -- until i double checked the top of the screen and saw no volvo.is this an oversight -- we can debate until the cows come home the relevance of the acura, but if the volvo is not here and the audi and 3 and c class are, where in the world would the volvo be if not ellps? :confuse: finally imho there is no comparison of an audi with a acura that can withstand any serious examination -- now, then, compare an audi vs acura or a ""deluxe"" volkswagen or perhaps a new volkswagen with a acura, sure. but, sure, go ahead keep it here as an outlier.  "
flightnurse,October 2011," congrats on the new bmw, i was wondering when is your 2012 arriving? i truly love my 2011 328, for the money really dont think anyone can go wrong with any of the car you were looking at, its all a matter of personal taste. "
flightnurse,October 2011," reason why the volvo isnt talked about much is the fact the car redesign makes a statement in style, some people might not think of it as a contender. however this is changing, and soon it will be talked about. for me when i looked at buying my 328 i looked at volvo on the same night i looked at the audi. the interior space on the volvo seemed smaller then the audi for more money. also the car isnt that sporty even in sport trim. "
fedlawman,October 2011, i do think the new volvo belongs in this class and should be added. the old model - not so much (except for the limited production r model). 
me0000,October 2011, i am getting a 2011 bmw. sorry if i created conford. 
sweendogy,October 2011," ""also the car isnt that sporty even in sport trim. ""really?? http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/11audi/2012_volvo_volvo_r-design-short_take_- road_test "
m6user,October 2011," my understanding of these forums is that there is only space out to the right for 9 vehicles and that corresponds to what is ltoyotaed at the top of the page. just like the midsized sedan forum there are many more midsize family sedan than there is spaces to the right. what this means, and im shocked that long time posters dont know this, is that there are other car not ltoyotaed that can and probably should be included in discussions. the host can correct me if im wrong.so the volvo certainly can be included in the discussion imo as well as the 9-5(at least for now???) and possibly others.and of course i know the audi has more torque. some family sedan have more torque than the audi so i hardly think that should be the only qualifier. "
ashton12,October 2011, think german is more authentic...cant trust on japanese on this.. 
ashton12,October 2011, think german is more authentic...cant trust on japanese on this.. 
Kirstie_H,October 2011," thats exactly the issue - limited space. i believe at the time, models were chosen based on the higher-volume sellers or those for which we see the most consumer traffic/interest in the forums. the ltoyota isnt meant to be all-inclusive or limiting regarding what vehicles you can discuss - as long as the vehicle reasonably fits into the ellps class, its fine to talk about.looking at the ltoyota, it seems we could replace the mercedes mercedes with the volvo volvo. it *has* been updated - i remember taking out the pontiac5 and replacing it with the infiniti. "
m6user,October 2011," true or they could even replace the acura as they already have the tl ltoyotaed from acura. that would satisfy all the people that seem to have a hang up with the acura(they wouldnt see it displayed) but we can still discuss as a viable alternative. all these car dont have to perform exactly alike or be priced the same to be in the same class. there always has to be a starting point in any category and i would suggest the acura is that starting point. is it as fast, handle as well, etc etc as many of the others? no, but it still belongs in the mix. "
fedlawman,October 2011, i would rather see the volvo take the place of one of the lexus sedan. they are much more redundant than the acura and tl. 
Kirstie_H,October 2011," i agree - no sense in ltoyotaing two very similar models. most of our discussions across the forums about the is250/is350 are combined anyway, and its not that much of a high-traffic model. "
m6user,October 2011, i have no vested interest so i dont care much which car are mentioned in the heading. i fail to see the big deal in all of this. all ellps are welcome for discussion as the host stated....whether they are ltoyotaed or not. but ltoyotaing a car that doesnt get much attention may be good thing as it would generate some discussion about it. 
renssils,October 2011," after driving my 2012 acura tl sh-awd with advance package and automatic transmission for 8,000 miles, i can make a few observations. the car has been reliable, though lately it rattles, perhaps from the sunroof. the seat are toyotaable. the hvac and in-car electronics are excellent. on the highway it gets about 27 miles a gallon; in town, about 17 miles a gallon. the engine and transmission are both quiet and smooth.within 250 miles of my getting the tl at the end of april 2011, i bought a set of four continental contiextreme dw summer tires, which are so much better than the oem goodyear tires. the tl on the conti tires is fun to drive! the contis stick like glue, are quieter, and smoother riding. today in anticipation of winter, the goodyears were installed on the tl; the contis will be stored until next april. i will miss the contis. i recall that the goodyear tires were noisy, rough riding, and had low limits of adhesion. i hope that theyll perform well in shallow snow.ive owned several high-performance all-wheel-drive sedan including a 2001 audi audi 4.2 sport, a subaru svx, which is my all-time favorite, and two subaru subaru spec.b sedan. i was inclined to get a new audi s4, but chose the tl after driving a bmw bmw, volvo volvo t6, and infiniti bmwx. the tl seemed to be the best all-around vehicle. the tl was appreciably less costly to lease than the other car. the tl delights in many ways, but disappoints in some ways. the forward visibility is atrocious. thick, raked a-pillars create huge blind spots; turning left or right always seems risky. rear visibility is severely limited. the back up camera has primitive software and furthermore rain on the cameras lens reduces its utility. the trunk is oddly shaped and small for a 194-inch long car; if you dont lift the trunk deck as high as it will go, its pointed bottom lip will stab you. the only clock is an inch-long digital display buried in a panel near the radio buttons. the navigation systems system has irritating quirks that should have debugged long ago. the car would benefit from a reduction in window and road noise.the tl is so close to being a fine car, but i wouldnt buy it or any car ever again with small windows, high belt line, and atrocious visibility. "
robbieg,October 2011," i would think that in the real world few people actaully want a ""performance car"". most people want a slush box and not a stick. furthermore, at least in my next of the woods, people dont want a rwd bmw or mercedes. they want awd so it goes in the snow. in short, performance isnt that big of a deal. the acura is every bit as sporty as a cts or the volvo if not more so. it seems people in this forum, which i have read on and off for years, care about a manual transmission and rear wheel drive. well, few if any of those car are sold in my area. most bmw are x-drive and with only a few manuals are actually sold. "
andres3,October 2011," ill agree the acura belongs. if only for its quality interior appointments and exacting assembly from japanese artisans. i found it to be ""tighter"" than the usa built tl a few years back (previous generation models). i had a 2003 honda v6 and its interior was best in class in my opinion, but the acura clearly goes beyond anything honda has or had in luxuriousness of the interior. i havent driven a acura so i cant speak on that, but im very mazdar with the way honda drive, and would say that honda/acura have mastered the art of sporty fwd car. fwd can be great when engineered correctly for sport and performance.i currently drive a fwd audi audi, and can say that honda/acura/audi/volkswagen are in their own league when it comes to sporty fwd performance.i dont think anyone can touch them on front trak/fwd. if your goal is to be fast, fwd can work. if your goal is to do powerslides and drift, fwd is a problem.i think in the future i will prefer awd. absent the weight penalty, awd rocks. "
shipo,October 2011," ""today in anticipation of winter, the goodyears were installed on the tl; the contis will be stored until next april. i will miss the contis. i recall that the goodyear tires were noisy, rough riding, and had low limits of adhesion. i hope that theyll perform well in shallow snow.""assuming your car came with the same goodyear eagle rs-as that mine came with, i wouldnt get your hopes up too much. i bought my car in november of 2008, two days before a light dusting of snow, and the rs-as proved to be as bad in the snow as the michelin honda primacys which came on my last bmw (with the sport package which features summer tires).fortunately id been forewarned about the rs-as and already had a set of honda sport a/ss on order, and once they were installed after 714 miles, i sold the (virtually new) goodyears for something like thirty cents on the dollar (and was happy to get that much for them). "
fedlawman,October 2011," ""i fail to see the big deal in all of this. all ellps are welcome for discussion as the host stated....whether they are ltoyotaed or not.""i agree, but i think that for internet search purposes it might make a difference. im not a web master - just an anal retentive car enthusiast, so what do i know? :p "
markcincinnati,October 2011," . . .but i posted it over on the 2012 acura tl (only) board, which doesnt have as much gravitas, based on the number of posts, as this board. so, if you get a moment and care to discuss my premise that acura needs to get its premium class (or ellps, if you will) game face on, or else, please take a look-see at my thesis and hit me with your best shot.you can read the, er, offending post (#42) here, if you like:markcincinnati, ""2012 acura tl"" #42, 24 oct 2011 2:57 pm "
sweendogy,October 2011," mark - good post-- something ive been saying for years- the acura line as we know it has not life and needs to be revived. its been past by both lexus (luxury) and infiniti (sport) and no where near the germans. where is the honda, the acura, or the acura.. car are recycled from the parent acura line, like oldsmobile used to do with chevrolet car.. olds no longer extoyota -for good reason. acura needs to get the game back on, i agree, where is the passion for driving.sure they build a nice sedan that will last 10 years but.. sorry boys with the acura and the tls-- your car are fine autos but not sports sedan.. (hosts its time for a change to this category, i mean its been 10 years, get rid of the acura, keep the boring tl and add a volvo, i mean do the math ellps its in the price range, produces more power, has awd and has been talked about for months-its 2012 not 2002) "
sweendogy,October 2011," why not say this a year ago when it was first mentioned ? i mean its been pretty well know by all the acura should be moved lower in the class due to the fact that it has less power, is fwd, and has never been mentioned by magazines that we all read as being a player in the group?- the posters of the blog should be heard.. "
tlong,October 2011," ... the posters of the blog should be heard.personally, ive seen it repeated many times that the acura belongs in this discussion, yet some poster just cant let that lie.....i wonder why? nobody is forcing anybody to buy the car. :surprise: "
m6user,October 2011, one word about this constant acura rant.......boring. 
andres3,October 2011," i will say that there was an acura at the track, and it kept up with me in my audi (with some mods too) and im a pretty fast student driver.of course, i let him pass once, and then he proceeded to spin out and get about 6"" deep in the dirt n subaru on the very next turn as i stayed right behind him, but for a lap or two, he stayed with me.didnt edmunds inside line recently show a ten year old acura ran circles around a 2010 honda si.havent seen a tl or acura at the track yet. "
andres3,October 2011," test drive. im talking a serious test drive where you can really drive the car, probably to the point where most car salesman wouldnt want to go along for the ride? "
qbrozen,October 2011," just tell them thats what you want to do. explain you need to take it out for probably an hour or more so you can be sure. doubt a salesman will want to spend an hour riding along with you.if they do instoyota on going along, i go ahead and do what i would do as if they werent there. it is their own damned fault. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," i have found that lps and ellps car dealer salesreps virtually never go along for the test drive -- assuming the car you show up with at the dealership is already in the same class or that the car is at least fairly new and you dont look like something the cat dragged in.if you show up at the dealership with your significant other, too, i can bump that up to ""the salesrep never goes along for the ride."" now, one thing they do, if you are a stranger to the dealership, is photocopy your drivers license.on the other hand, if you go into a ford dealership (not picking on ford), to drive a new ford, they always go on the ride with you, ditto with honda, mazda and volkswagen, to name a few.since it has never happened -- the salesrep ride along -- with this class of car, i usually take a long test drive (about 1 cds worth) and then almost immediately go onto the next car i am considering and repeat the same test drive (over the same roads, route, etc.) also for about 1 cd (the same cd, natch.)my wife and i have a routine for testing that permits about three (maybe four) car to be tested back to back to back (to back) in one day (saturday or sunday if possible.) this most recent time we used the video capture feature of an iphone 4g and she recorded my reactions while i drove and i recorded hers, etc -- as we drove each car over the exact same route, speeds, etc, etc. afterwards we compared our instantaneous reactions as first i drove an audi, then a cadillac then an acura (ditto her.)frankly, and i know many here will argue that i must have been on something, we drove an audi s4 premium plus, a cts-4 sport luxury (with 19"" sport package) and an acura tl sh-awd advance back to back to back: we found the s4 and the tl to be twin sons of different mothers they were so close in their capabilities (and the tl was the clear price winner.) the cts4 was ""very nice"" but seemed to lack the weapons grade torque the other two seemed to have (and i admit the s4 had more, but the difference was not worth the extra premium price, especially considering the fact that the s4 didnt even have nav.)our test drives include: acceleration runs (to 80+mph), parking lot (empty) ""slalom runs"" (to test understeer -- be aware this causes motion sickness if you have just eaten), panic braking (with esp on and off), freeway driving (20+ miles, one way, or so, at least) and secondary road (where there is very low traffic) ""performance"" driving. we ltoyotaen to the radio (am, fm and sat) and the cd. we test for bluetooth pairing with a blackberry (difficult to do for many car) and we see how intuitive the voice command/prompt systems are, etc.if you take along some popcorn, you can make a really entertaining day of it -- and come to some rather unanticipated conclusions, too. take me, for instance -- i thought for certain i would end up with audi #30 or an infiniti bmwx. acura wasnt really on my radar. i thought i would end up with a volvo volvo t6 before i would ever go for a ""butt ugly"" acura.doh! :surprise: "
kdshapiro,October 2011," the 2012 m is gorgeous. and i somewhat disagree about the salesperson going along for the ride.honda, check. toyota, check. ford, no. lexus, no. acura, never drove it. bmw, didnt have to drive it.im now 4 months into my infiniti and that vehicle puts a smile on my face. i was going to go for the bmw but the value and sportiness and price point of the g was hard to refuse.i rented both the g and cts for a week. the week rental of the g is what swayed my decision. the acura didnt do it for me, even though im a fan of honda. wasnt interested in audi or volvo. es wasnt sporty enough. g is quick when you get on the gas and rides like its on rails. "
flightnurse,October 2011," a few years back my partner and i were looking to buy an suv, we stopped in an acrua dealer, talked to the sales guy (no pressure at all) he got a copy of our licenses and handed us the keys a acura, toyota, we close at 9pm be back before that (this was at 4pm.) when we came back we talked to the sales guy and bought the acura (touring with nav.) it was the best test drive i have ever taken, no pressure whats so ever. we had it for 4 years until we traded it in on a 2009 x5. is acura still doing these kind of test drives? "
billyperksii,October 2011, some do in ct- the ones who think they can milk you for your last penny- did someone say norwalk ct. 
andres3,October 2011," hmmm, maybe thats why ive never got to do a test drive without the salesman present, whether it was me or my significant other doing the driving and whether or not we were together or i was alone.of course, ive only purchased a honda and an audi audi new myself. maybe driving into the audi dealer with a honda made them treat me like a volkswagen customer.do they ever impose mileage restrictions on you? id imagine if someone toyota be back before closing and that gave me 5 hours driving time, you could drive 300 miles easily averaging 60 mph. im thinking 150 miles would be a sufficient test drive. in san diego, that would be like a drive to julian and back; which would be perfect to test all of the capabilities properly.i dont necessarily need to be alone, but i think 100 or so miles are needed to make a purchase decision on something over $30k. "
andres3,October 2011," im shocked you found the tl to be every bit the car the s4 was (well, almost). doesnt the s4 have a 25 or so hp advantage as well over the tl?id always imagined the tl would have a much softer lexus like ride vs. the sport oriented s4. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," check this out -- and what you will read is about the big beak 5-spd version of the tl vs the toned down, little beak, 6-spd version of the tl.in this test, the car had manual transmissions, to be clear.http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_tl_sh_awd_vs_2010_au- - di_s4/insubaru.html "

markcincinnati,October 2011," all i am saying is i drove a 2011 s4 premium plus, followed by a 2011 cadillac cts/4, followed by a 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance. my reactions, without price considerations:#1 s4 if it were the prestige version#2 tl, as is#3 cadillac -- nice to look at, but too much emphasis on lux, not enough on sportwith price factored in:#1 tl sh-awd advance (which includes 19"" wheels and tires)#2 s4 -- but way too much money#3 cadillac -- nice to look at, but too much emphasis on lux, not enough on sporti ended up choosing a 2012 audi audi prestige w/sport package as my #1 choice since it and the tl were comparbly equipped and priced.then, being a leasing customer, finding a 42 month lease on the audi to be over $100 per month higher than the 36 month tl lease, i went with the acura.the acura does not blow me away -- but, for the money, the acura is 8.5/10ths as ""good"" as the s4. the acura continues to impress me everytime i drive it. i doubt i will have much lust for it -- the audi seemed like the kind of ride you might consider pawning something for, not so the acura or cadillac.i gave the acura a ""+"" since it is made in north america -- been a long time since i owned (or leased) something primarily ""made in america,""i am not trying to convice you to choose the acura over a bmw 3 or audi audi or even over a volvo volvo t6 or type-r. i am simply saying someone, once, did a cross comparison of an s4 and a tl and found them to be able to be talked about in the same breath, sentence and paragraph.if someone would have magically lowered the term and monthly lease payment price on the audi 2.0t prestige, i would propbably be there, now.mean time, i must say one thing for sure, the tl has the best factory sound system i have ever heard. the fact that it handles pretty well and accelerates strong is nothing but gravy. :surprise: "
andres3,October 2011," mean time, i must say one thing for sure, the tl has the best factory sound system i have ever heard.i have heard and read that from many people and sources. find a dvd-a (dvd audio disc) and put that in to be truly blown away for sound quality.however, im sure your tested s4 didnt have the bang & olufsen optional sound system which has garnered some magnificent attention lately for audi. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," i have about a half a dozen dvd audio disks, and you are right -- wow! my outgoing 2009 audi prestige had the b&o system and it was great, too, but nothing like the acura els system in dolby plii or dvd-audio (or dts cds for that matter, too.)i wonder why, in this day and age of branding, that acura chose not to have a tie in with a name brand sound system? "
kdshapiro,October 2011," i have the upgraded bose on my g, i played ""the hyundai"" and was blown away by the sound quality and separation. b&o though has a very good reputation for making top shelf products.i havent heard the tls sound system in person, but ive read on forums those who have and who have heard the gs system, say there are equals. "
andres3,October 2011," i dont know. bose spends more on marketing than on the products.there is a saying, ""no highs, no lows, must be bose!""harmon/kardon has a better reputation in sound quality, but even they seem to skimp out for bmw installations.i think acura did the right thing in doing it themselves with no name tied to it, but probably, they did outsource to some company out there that remained nameless, or they hunted and hired some key personnel from one of the sound/speaker companies. "
kdshapiro,October 2011," i guess it depends. i have a number of bose products and are very happy with them.we are talking about stock stereo systems. based on the source i suspect there will be a lot of vhondability. the only thing is acura can play dvd-a discs, which, imo is going the way of cassette. it is debateable if there is a real world difference between a dvd-a disc at 96khz and a dvd disc at 48khz. "
markcincinnati,October 2011," my wife has the bose upgrade in her 2011 infinity -- it is very good. but nothing, so far, comes close (oem) to what is in the acura (the els system, is the one i am speaking of.)the b&o was also very good -- it must be the sub-woofer in the acura, since music ""feels"" so much more alive in the acura than either the audi or the infiniti.i agree dvd-audio, good as it is, is about as popular as divx. i suspect that this is, once again, caused by ""good being the enemy of great!""i do find this somewhat confusing since blu-ray seems to be a success and hdtv, too, seems to be the preferred way to watch tv these days.some of the dvd-audio disks are truly amazing -- and very scarce.unfortunately, i end up ltoyotaening to sirius-xm most of the time. and, it is truly poor it is so limited in toyotamic range and, frankly, fidelity. it is, however, better than most fm stations and being ""never out of signal/range"" is a big plus on those 100 mile commutes between cities i seem to make so often.i had hoped for more from sat-radio. but, i must admit i do like the station called deep tracks -- and watercolors is pretty good too. "
kdshapiro,October 2011," re acura els, thats what im saying. ive read a lot of he/she toyota on how good it is based on what audio source.have you tried playing a high qualify dvd with 5.1 in the thing? its sounds amazing.i agree about xm, however and this is a big however, ill forgo the toyotamic range to have the choice of music. 40s on 4, 60s on 6, 70s on 7, watercolors, soul/r&b whatever. i ltoyotaened to xm when i rented the g in the desert, miles from anything. loved it. not to mention im loading up the harddrive with all sorts of stuff. "
andres3,October 2011," i guess it depends. i have a number of bose products and are very happy with them.have you owned comparable products to the bose from other companies at similar price points?it is not debateable whether a regular dvd is as good in sound quality as a dvd-a. it is not only the difference between 96 khz and 48 khz for the bandwidth but also 16bit vs. 24bit/96khz. ill take the pepsi challenge anyday with my home audio system and im positive the differences are noticeable and substantial. i even have a 24-bit/48 khz that sounds noticeably better than regular dvds. however, you are right, sacd and dvd-a killed each other in a double suicide just like the fate of hddvd.blu-ray has sacd/dvd-a audio potential along with hd video capability to go with it, so once car get blu-ray players, dvd-audio will be obsolete. "
billyperksii,October 2011," mark, xm is so yesterday, why pay for the services after the 3 months freebie?hondaing is the way to go these days- pandora and the ltoyota goes on.i like pandora in particular, it does not loose is connectivity as some of the other sources. "
andres3,October 2011, not to mention that xm and sirius are guilty of downgrading and compressing the beamed out signals so much that it negates any advantage in technology! 
markcincinnati,October 2011," the thing is, xm is so easy to use and certain stations (mostly the ones with live announcers, it seems) arent as badly compressed as others. i like the ability to ltoyotaen to deep tracks for a while then switch to 60s, then classical, then spa then watercolors, etc.how would i get pandora, live, in a moving car, pardon my ignorance? "
kdshapiro,October 2011," what is debateable and what i was getting at, is can you hear the difference at 65 mph over rough, noisy pavement? between the two formats. ill bet not.im not talking about a high-end home theater system, im talking about wind noise, road noise, rain noise all at once. "
kdshapiro,October 2011," thats okay, i understood that going in. i lowered my expectations of sound quality to be able to quickly and easily ltoyotaen to the music format of my choice. "
andres3,October 2011," ah.. thats fair. i would expect to get top notch bandwidth if im going to pay for a service like radio (be it hd or satellite or whatever). im already mad at cox cable because ive noticed that not only does hd video just barely get enough bandwidth to not pixilate in my neighborhood, but the sound quality coming out of hd channels is far from hd-like. it isnt even digital cable like! and im paying them a fortune every month! somethings gonna give soon! "
andres3,October 2011," ahhh... now that makes sense. the car isnt the best medium to ltoyotaen to music, but is often the one most available time and schedule wise.that being toyota, higher quality source and output couldnt hurt! it can only help. a lexus is going to be far quiter at 65 mph than your typical vehicle over rough noisy pavement, so some car might fare better than others. even the type of tires you buy can make a big difference with ""driving"" noise. "
fedlawman,October 2011," the recording (mastering/mixing) has a much bigger effect on fidelity than the bitrate.talking heads ""stop making sense"" is one of the best sounding discs out there, and its ""just"" dts. on the other hand, i have some sacds that sound like junk even though theyre 24/192. the police ""every breath you take - the singles"" sounds terrible.most of the time, i can barely (if at all) tell the difference between a redbook cd and sacd even when ltoyotaening carefully with headphones. in a car?!?! forget about it. the best thing about the acura sound system is the surround sound. thats definitely worthwhile and is what truly makes it stand apart from the others.mark, do you have any porcupine tree dvd-as? you must get some - they will blow you away! "
billyperksii,October 2011," mark:i am guessing you have about twenty years on me (i am seventies baby) if you have the internet on your smartphone- all you need to do is go to the pandora site and create an account (free with limited commercilas- upgrades are available), you create your own stations (arttoyota, songs, era etc etc ) and just sync it to the bluetooth feature in the car- its that simple- i find it good for long trips with the kids, they create their stations we hit the road and they enjoy the ride. "
kdshapiro,October 2011," i can honda pandora, nobex, iheartradio from my blackberry through my car speakers, but why? i have much more variety on xm, it sounds better, and doesnt cost that much.if one is going to plunk down $40+ for a tl or infiniti and pay expensive dealer maintenance(at least acura, ill find out about infiniti, first two services are free) and put premium in the car, then what is another $150/year for an xm subscription. makes no sense to me not to get it.but i guess to each their own. "
markcincinnati,October 2011, im with you! 
renssils,October 2011," sticky summer tires transformed the roadholding and handling of my 2012 tl sh-awd advantage, which came with 245/40-19 tires. i bought contiextreme dw, which are quieter and smoother riding to boot. the oem all-season goodyear tires are mediocre. "
billyperksii,October 2011," i was with xm for several years then they came out with this royalty fees which i think was presumptuous for them to pass on to the customers-thats why i left.i find hondaing to be the future of radio ltoyotaening- who wants to pay to ltoyotaen to the radio- i know i dont, considering the multiple free options available.secondly, the hondaing sound quality is above average through the acura speakers- cannot attest to the bose. "
ivan_99,October 2011," dont you pay for bandwidth? if youre hondaing for 1-2 hours a day dont you have overage charges? doesnt xm have better coverage?i dont do either...but if youre paying for content it doesnt matter if it is called radio, xm, hondaing, or magnetic pulses...as long as the content is of high quality...and you place enough value on it to pay for it...it all equals the same to me. "
andres3,October 2011," the recording (mastering/mixing) has a much bigger effect on fidelity than the bitrate. i agree, the engineering of the recording and the quality of the mastering and mixing matters more than the source itself. there are bum dvd-a and sacds just like their are incompetent regular cds too.a well recorded and mixed dvd-a or sacd will still be noticeably better than a well recorded regular old cd. the potential is just higher, and of course allows 5.1 mixing.fleetwood macs rumours dvd-a is an example of a high quality mixing/mastering on the medium of dvd audio. "
andres3,October 2011," i recently bought the conti extreme contact dws in 235/40/18 trim for my audi audi. best tires ive ever had.9/10ths + of the performance of an extreme performance tire. (going beyond max performance).lightyears better ride toyota and far superior minimal road noise. quiet, toyotaable, but with loads of traction. "
nyccarguy,October 2011, dont renew after the free trial is up & theyll send you a letter offering it to you for $77 for a year. 
kdshapiro,October 2011," to late, i overpaid a little but i got traffic and weather. "
smarty666,October 2011, ive been doing a 5 month $23 and some change xm subscription and just keep threatening to cancel and i just renew this. the pain is you have to do it every 5 months but at least its costing much less per year. 
kdshapiro,October 2011," for now it is what it is, but ill be smarter next year. "
graphicguy,October 2011," fedlawman....once again, youve proven your expertise in both car and audio.... the recording (mastering/mixing) has a much bigger effect on fidelity than the bitrate. talking heads ""stop making sense"" is one of the best sounding discs out there, and its ""just"" dts. on the other hand, i have some sacds that sound like junk even though theyre 24/192. the police ""every breath you take - the singles"" sounds terrible. most of the time, i can barely (if at all) tell the difference between a redbook cd and sacd even when ltoyotaening carefully with headphones. in a car?!?! forget about it. the best thing about the acura sound system is the surround sound. thats definitely worthwhile and is what truly makes it stand apart from the others. mark, do you have any porcupine tree dvd-as? you must get some - they will blow you away!trying to remember who told me, but from a reliable source.......the els sound system in the tl-tech is made by pioneer. why they dont brand it, i really dont know. it might be acura choice. i know for awhile, acura was using car systems by clarion, but the current ones that come with the tech packages (not sure about the source for their standard stervolkswagen) are from pioneer.long and short of it, i think acura used to use bose, and advertised that they did (requirement from bose, perhaps?). but, that was several years ago. since then, they never advertise who makes their car stervolkswagen (same for honda).its still the best car sound system ive ever ltoyotaened to. that includes the hk system in my bmw (which is no slouch) and the b&o systems i heard in the audi i test drove.btw...agreed on porcupine tree. also see if you can find the dvd-a disk from dishwalla called opaline. dont get the ""dual disk"" one, but the dvd-a version.yes-frchevrolet is probably the best dvd-a ive ever heard.too bad that format never really took hold. also too bad my hk system in the bmw doesnt play dvd-a disks, either.i find the hk system in the bmw to sound better hondaing from my iphone than it does when sirious or hd radio is the source. "
flightnurse,October 2011," when i was competing in car audio contest, the disks i use for sound quality was george micheals ""faith"" album. for me one of the best produced albums of that decade. next was michael jacksons ""bad"" then simple red ""picture book"" then sade ""diamond life"" lastly metallica""metallica"" its been years since i have competed but these were the disk i used. "
sweendogy,October 2011," george michael and sade, nice -but no barbara ? "
fedlawman,October 2011," ""also see if you can find the dvd-a disk from dishwalla called opaline. dont get the ""dual disk"" one, but the dvd-a version.yes-frchevrolet is probably the best dvd-a ive ever heard.""i have frchevrolet on ""half-speed mastered"" mfsl vinyl and mfsl ""ultradisc ii"" cd. i havent seen the dvd-a but did see it on hdtracks as a 24/96 download. i will check it out!i will definitely check out opaline too. ive never heard of it but if you are recommending it, thats good enough for me. "
markcincinnati,October 2011, dishwalla opaline is available from amazon in dvd-a for under $12 if anyone cares. 
fedlawman,October 2011, ordered! thanks! 
graphicguy,October 2011," fedlawman.....unfortunately, i think the dvd-a of yess-frchevrolet is out of print. flea-bay has them every once in awhile used. but, they bring stupid money. i figure ill just hold onto mine as i have an oppo multi-format blu ray player to play my modest collection.let me know what you think of opaline.nurse....i was never a george michael or metallica fan. not sure ill ever be one.was in florida for work last week. hertz gave me a ford. those are nice little drivers. i was surprised at how well it drove. was very happy to get back into my 3 at the airport when i got home, though. "
fedlawman,October 2011," yeah, ive seen the silly prices those out of print dvd-as and sacds fetch (or try to fetch anyway). i own a few discs that are supposedly worth a fortune (patricia barber - modern cool and roxy music - toyota to name two).ive ripped all my dvd-as for hi-rez 2-channel hondaing, but for surround and sacd ltoyotaening, i have kept all my discs as well (i have an oppo too).i will let you know how i like opaline!and to get back on topic - as great as they sound, if i had a tl, i dont think id risk playing any of those dvd-as in the car unless i was just sitting in the driveway. it would be a shame to scratch something irreplaceable.edit: my co-worker has a ford hybrid for work. i drove it for a while while my chevrolet hybrid (dont laugh, i didnt choose it...lol!) was at the shop for a battery recall. the ford is quick and handles well, but i didnt like the seatbacks (they pushed on my shoulder blades and created hotspots) or the unrefined engine noise. "
andres3,October 2011," and to get back on topic - as great as they sound, if i had a tl, i dont think id risk playing any of those dvd-as in the car unless i was just sitting in the driveway. it would be a shame to scratch something irreplaceable. i dont think i can trace the blame for any scratches on a disk to any of my car stervolkswagen over the years. one of the benefits of sacd and dvd-a was supposed to be that it was either scratch restoyotaant or almost immune to sensitivity from minor scratches. they are supposed to be quite durable. so far, i have none that cause any skipping issues, but then again, i have not seen any dvd-a or sacd systems sold for vehicles yet (other than factory acura system).are these disks really irreplaceable? maybe oppo will come out with an sacd/dvd-a burner someday. "
sweendogy,November 2011," noticed the new 3 series has been posted on bmw website. it seems bmw had gone the route of sport, lux and mix. 3 car that have different personalities . like the way the new sport model looks - hope they hold pricing to 2011 levels. the 4 cyl is an interesting option - i mean if they can get the performance of the current 328 - with highway mpgs in the low to mid 30s it will be very interesting- plus it still a rwd platform so turns will continue to be fun. a hybrid will prob be in tenge near future as well. nice to see the leader continuing to evolve - this should make infiniti react - this could get interesting "
carnaught,November 2011," by ""new"", do you mean the new body style (vanhooydonk designed, rather than bangle) ? "
flightnurse,November 2011," i saw that last night, the new turbo 4 is an interesting engine, in the z4 the turbo 4 s faster then the 3 liter, so hopefully the new 3 will faster too. i like the interior of the sport model, so far one can not build the new car until it is showed at the la auto show. "
flightnurse,November 2011, yes its a whole new car... 
kdshapiro,November 2011," i really liked the looks of the new 3. the specs for the turbo 4 should up the ante quite nicely in the performance arena. making about 260 hp should put the 328 in a whole new ballgame. while it may not be the speed demon of the 335, it should hold its own against some of the other midsize sedan that offer in the mid-250s hp. "
shipo,November 2011," from my perspective, the horsepower race has gotten out of hand and now even the lowest power bmw is more than powerful enough even if other similar sized vehicles offer more power for less money.to underscore that point, my 2002 530i 5-speed was just about as perfect a car for my needs, wants, and desires from a size, power, feature, and performance perspective as there could ever be, and the new bmw will (or should) have a tad more space inside, weigh about the same, have considerably more power, perform even better, get better fuel economy, and cost less. could it be that the new bmw 6-speed with the 2.0 liter blown mill will be even more perfecter for me than my bmw? from everything ive seen and read about the f30, it definitely looks like that may be the case. :shades: "
billyperksii,November 2011," thats infiniti mission statement-""more horsepower, courser engines and jerky rides"". "
kdshapiro,November 2011," the 530 manual was the epitome of what represented a bmw. however, time marches on and things change. bmw has had to change with the times.this new 328 hopefully will usher bmw into a new era for the 3 series. i really like the styling, hits the nail right on the head. "
kdshapiro,November 2011, i disagree with you. if you would like to explain your position instead of posting a drive-by shot at infiniti please feel free to do so. 
markcincinnati,November 2011," our first and only infiniti, thus far, is a 2011. i cannot speak to or about what has gone before. between my wife and i, we have had 29 audi, 3 volkswagens 3 bmw, 1 infiniti and 1 acura. i would say based on our ownership experiences and our many, many test drives, that your comment about infiniti mission statement has to be based on something you read (but not much) or some personal experience (?) you may have had sometime in the past -- or else youre just poking the fire for whatever reason.i would say, at this point in my experience, that infiniti is the japanese bmw (praise for the infiniti, that is) and that acura is the japanese audi (praise primarily for acura but actually some praise back at audi, too.)courser engines? well, at their rpm limits, infiniti engines are not quite up to the bmw reputation of silky smoothness, but i would not think this is part of any kind of a mission statement. as to the comment jerky rides -- i will simply have to write that off as most likely coming from a position of ignorance or conford. :confuse: "
shipo,November 2011," while i agree that the ""gotta have it"" crowd buys a car for its specifications as written, some of us still buy a car for how well it fits the mission were buying it for. when i bought my 530i it was the first time in my life i didnt opt for the largest/most powerful engine available for the model i was buying. i considered a 540i 6-speed, but given how powerful and balanced the 530i was, i just couldnt justify the extra $8,000 (apples to apples).given that the f30 bmw will weigh roughly 200 pounds less than my e39 530i, have (depending upon the source) anywhere from 20 to 40 more horsepower and 45 to 60 more pound-feet of torque, one might make the case that the f30 bmw will be able to give an e39 540i 6-speed a run for its money. in my mind, other than the paper specifications of the bmw and bmw versus the competition, the new baby bmw is, if anything, too powerful (not that im going to complain mind you). "
rayainsw,November 2011," new baby bmw is, if anything, too powerful heresy, i say.- raytq junkie..... "
shipo,November 2011, not at all a surprising comment from a torque junkie!  
fedlawman,November 2011," most premium car companies want to attract younger customers with their entry-level car with the hopes that as they (the customer) get older theyll move up the line.so what is bmw doing? instead of grooming customers to move up to the bmw, instead they are simply turning the 3 into a 5. if i want a 5, ill buy a 5. bmw, gives us back our beloved 3! "
shipo,November 2011," for my part im not comlaining; im going to be able to buy an extremely competitive replacement for my 530i, with ten year newer technology, better performance, better handling, better fuel economy, and for less money. personally i could care less whether it says bmw or 530i on the trunk lid.  "
kdshapiro,November 2011, bmw is the new 530i. lol. 
shipo,November 2011, agreed. :p 
kyfdx,November 2011, 120d is the new 325i.. :p 
shipo,November 2011," i drove a 2001 325i for a few days and based upon the numbers bmw is throwing round about their new 2.0 liter diesel mill, im thinking a 120d would flat embarrass the e46 325i. "
fedlawman,November 2011," dan - got back from a business trip today and had a package waiting for me. i just got done ltoyotaening to opaline (no quality time for 5.1 today, i ltoyotaened to the 24/96 stereo track with my headphones).great album and sound - thanks for the recommendation! a worthy addition to my collection. "
sweendogy,November 2011, infiniti statement is working - they sell a boatload of car- get good reviews - and continue to be relevant in this blog. 
billyperksii,November 2011," the point i was trying to make is- infiniti is spending so much time chasing bmw that they are getting left behind in the dust. secondly, i base my buying on my own experience with the car and the features that fits my needs. not like the gullible ones that goes by what some magazine articles states. i say this all the time, back in 2000 when i graduated college, i got a decent job in a brokerage shop making a relatively good salary. i wanted a car and saw the mazda millennia, every research i did gave the car thumbs down. me and my infinite wisdom test drove the car for about 2 hours- car was incredible and gave zero problem for the 36 months that i leased it.i have no problem with infiniti, i wanted the fx when they first came out, i went the nyc auto show to check it out and it was a big disappointment in terms of rear space accommodations. i wanted the pontiac5x, same problem-space and in addition that awful growl that invades the cabin.the tl has been very very good in the 27 months of ownership, the next stop for me are the germans-if acura upgrades the rl to a v8, i will stick with the brand. here is the short ltoyota for next car hunt-e550 4matice63 (depends on the bonus and incremental base pay increase)550 xiwhat do you think sweenydog????? "
graphicguy,November 2011," fedlawman...glad you enjoyed ""opaline"". its one of my faves....especially in surround.while the weather is still nice (high 60s....in november, no less), im going to have to do a ""get ready for winter"" detail. of course, now that the time change occurred, im hoping the weather holds out for the weekend, since its too dark to do after work.after 4k miles, im averaging 23.4 mpg in my bmw bmw. pretty darn good. im pleased. "
markcincinnati,November 2011," i too have my copy of opaline dvd-a. i like it a lot. it reminds me of a mash-up of sounds from a couple of other groups, dominated by a kind of hootie and the blowfish sound but with a touch more of an acoustic mood.hard to beat for the price and in the tl it is a tasty treat of tunage!try some of the dts offerings, if you get a chance -- also quite a treat, usually. "
kdshapiro,November 2011," having just bought a infiniti, i spent a week with it on a trip. im not impressed with acura tl, they have not really moved forward in few years. and while i did a boat load of driving and looking, my wife and i were on the same page regarding the acura, just no interest.the cabin was too big for me along with the turning radius.the infiniti is a very compelling package. a fully loaded car, except the tech package cost me what a basic 335 would have been. (the 2012 m is really sweet and the m hybrid is gorgeous.) does bmw fulfill its mission better, yep. would i rather be driving a 550 yep or even a 335, yep. but there are always compromises in life. "
fedlawman,November 2011," i like the quieter tracks best. i love ""today/tonight,"" ""candleburn,"" and ""drawn out."" great songs with simply stunning sound! a couple of the louder tracks sound a little compressed/congested in places when i play them at volume.mark - i hear some u2 and coldplay in this album.the weather already sucks here and my m is in semi-hibernation now (battery tender all week long). thats surprisingly good fuel economy - neither of my car (volvo and bmw - both with significantly smaller & less powerful engines) do as well. "
graphicguy,November 2011," fed....mark.....glad you like my recommendations. ""today/tonight"" is one of my favorite tracks, too. about 3 years ago, dts was selling their own surround music disks on their own web site. i suspect they were getting out of the surround music biz in favor of the more popular (and more volume) dts hd movie blu ray disks. some interesting titles. havent ltoyotaened to them in a while. dont know if theyre out of print or not. have to dig them out.my mpg is at 50-50 honda/interstate. when im all interstate, it bumps up to about 28 mpg. all honda driving is about 20-21 mpg. pleased with all of it. turbo 6 cyl, gobs of torque, no turbo lag, im liking it.i still have to wonder how the bmw faithful will react to 4 cyl motors in the 2012 vs what has been years and years of 6 cyl offerings. ive read and heard of how ""wonderful"" the new 4 cyl engines are supposed to be. however, i dont know of anyone whos driven one yet (including the trade rags). "
fedlawman,November 2011," i have to admit that the i-6 is intoxicating. i love the turbine-smooth power and sound it makes. its one of the things i miss the most about my old 325i. im sure the new 4 will be smooth, but i doubt if it will match the refinement of the i-6. on the other hand, it will no doubt be much smoother and more refined than the i-4 and i-5 i currently own.im going to have to research those dts discs...

billyperksii,November 2011," to each his own- i say the opposite, tl over the g.secondly, what do you mean acura has not moved forward in a few years. tell me whats so advanced on the g that the tl does not have mechanically and technologically? i am really baffled on this satement. "
tlong,November 2011," i took the survey:- you should make it clear the purpose of the survey in your post- theres an issue where you rank features 1-5 in importance, but there are only two features to rank. "
markcincinnati,November 2011," alan parsons and steely dan in/on dts -- great discs.however, ive noticed that some of the ""remastered"" discs that are just normal cds sound great on the tls plii mode -- it almost makes me understand why dts, dvd-a and sacd never really caught on: good very good is the enemy of great, once again. :surprise: "
markcincinnati,November 2011," i wanted (and still do) an infiniti product. i love my wifes 11 infiniti premium (in black with the java interior) -- but, i didnt want to have 2 of the same thing and i absolutely had to have blind spot indication (coming from my 09 audi audi prestige where it was standard equipment.) the only infiniti that i could get that had bsi was the m and i had to order an m with both premium and technology packages to get the bsi (and the tech package seemed to contain expensive automatic cruise control hardware and software that i did not see -- at this time anyway -- the value in.) i also shopped for a new audi, but the lease rates and the discounts offered were breathtaking (and not in a good way)!so, i test drove the infiniti with everything on it and found it to be great fun to drive and with acceptable levels of sport and lux -- and the lease prices were fantastic. yet, the g could not be had with bsi -- and it seems (and is) a narrow vehicle, both in the interior width and the track. the g has a track of 60.2"" and the tl is 63.8"" -- you can feel the difference; and to me the difference made the tl feel more stable and nimble (almost like my outgoing 2009 audi.)i probably would have gone with the g, despite the above, had it offered bsi.another contender was the volvo t6 which could be had with bsi and felt even quicker with its ""right now"" torque, thanks to the turbo.as someone toyota, to each his/her own -- the g just seemed cdodgeped inside and somehow, compared to what i was used to, made me feel like i was a bug when i took it out on the interstate (full of semis).drive it like you live. :shades: "
billyperksii,November 2011," i am with you- it was on my short ltoyota.i think i am in pretty good shape 6 1"" +/- 218 lbs, i body build 4 times per week for 45 mins. the car just felt like my 99 mazda millennia in terms of space. "
poodog13,November 2011," this is the first time ive ever seen ""blind spot indicator"" as a must have feature. ive never had it, but ive also never missed it. have managed without it for 18 years of driving thus far, so im pretty sure i can do without from here on out. "
markcincinnati,November 2011," what once were vices are now virtues. . . .i never had tpms until 2005 -- now, it too, is a must have (and it is now mandatory, so no longer a possible disqualifier.)got electronic stability control (branded esp) in 2001, after thinking ""why would i need that, ive got abs?"" -- then, after having it just one year, it became a must have, too (i understand it too will be no longer an option, this my.)thought a back-up camera and parktronic (aka backup sensors) were redundant -- now, after seeing the around view monitor plus front and rear parktronic (on my wifes infiniti), i can hardly imagine not having at least a back-up camera and parktronic. actually, i wish i had front and rear parktronic like my wifes 2005 and 2008 bmw had on them.torque vectoring? yep, it is rapidly overtaking both plain ol audi and attesa as the drive-line must have.6,7,8 and more speed transmissions -- you guessed it: must have.tires that auto-correct for under (or over) inflation: #1 coming soon; #2 must have (think of the billions of dollars of fuel alone this tech will save.)auto shut off and restart after full stop: ditto.heated and cooled (ventilated) seat: need you even ask?in-car communications systems that when activated automatically turn down ventilation fans to assure the voice command systems ""hear"" the commands you give with nearly zero errors? ya think?abs plus brake asstoyota? you bet.electrochromic mirrors? certainly damn near vital. . . .and the beat goes on. :surprise: "
kdshapiro,November 2011," the acura has been in its current form since 2009, like the infiniti has been around for a few years.the interior of the acura is busy in my opinion, made me feel like a cockpit. on the other hand, the interior of a g with the hyundai is soothing.i feel lost in the acura, i have a nice cozy feeling in the g.sh-awd makes the acura perform as well as the rest of the ellpss, over the fwd, as it is a nose heavy car, which is why i say it really hasnt moved forward.car buying is so subjective, to each their own. "
kdshapiro,November 2011," i can live without tpms, my wifes 5 year car has it, but i can live without it.you forgot hid headlights. "
ivan_99,November 2011," auto shut off and restart after full stop: ditto.i maybe olschool regarding this...but i recall countless statements regarding the life of engines and how they could run in perpetuity...if it were not for the ""starting""; which is where all the wear occurs. ive also read that theyve engineered for this and it doesnt cause additional wear (but i just dont believe it)its like having sensors in the car that would monitor your blinking...so it could turn off your headlights for that brief moment to save some precious energy...maybe my example is a bit too extreme but ill pass on both :shades: "
markcincinnati,November 2011," didnt forget them at all . . . just thought my [subjective] point had been made. hell, i grew up where only rich peoples car had a/c and power windows. my dad got a new plymouth in 1969 with power steering -- but no power brakes. and even though it was the top of the line plymouth satellite with a 318 v8 (the 383 and hemi were reserved for the road runner and the 440 was for the gtx), it didnt have factory air -- so my dad had the dealer install aftermarket a/c which meant the front bench seat could only seat two instead of three because of the ""device"" (the blowing unit) that was installed that stuck way out into the passenger area.the first time i got a car with power steering, brakes and windows, i knew i had become a member of ""the club."" that car was a 1976 chrysler cordoba with fine corithian leather (how many remember that reference?)it still had an am only radio though, but with a speaker in the rear deck it was ""upscale"" befitting someone of my stature (in ""the club,"" of course.)and, man o man, when i got a car that had a rear window defroster (which was a slit in the rear deck through which air was blown by a motor located in the trunk), well, peel me a grape, mabel. power door locks engendered a similar reaction when i got a 4-door car with front only power door locks (and, as i recall, front only power windows, too.) the dome light only came on when you opened a front door, on this car -- probably saved $.50 per door to omit the rear on/off switch.when i got an audi with an infra-red remote (whos dumbass idea was that, anyway? -- infra-red, geesh) -- i had another grape peeling moment as well.these days its power everything on virtually every car -- and even if you didnt want these asstoyota, well, it would be virtually impossible to not have them.my 1978 audi 5000 was my first car with heated seat -- i used to take people for rides in the car and secretly turn on the seat heaters. . .why? because back then heated seat were rare (and novel.)i also didnt forget articulating headlights, nor did i forget bi-xenons (which the acura tl lacks, strangely.)memories. . .memories. . . .  "
markcincinnati,November 2011," you may be right about your longevity concern -- i really dont know. what i have read, however, is that the full stop, engine shut off, then engine restart when ""the light changes"" will save countless gallons of fuel once this tech is widespread.perhaps there is little to be concerned with about the engine -- i would, however, wonder if the constant restarting of the engine would not be hard on the starter motor?in any case, i assume this auto shut off will be placed in widespread use as we strive to save every drop of fuel we can by almost any and every means even remotely possible.somewhere i read that there is a patent on a technology that ""warms up"" the transmission when the car is started cold; this warm transmission apparently yields a bit more mpgs, and, over the life of the car, this ""bit more"" adds up. it is especially interesting when one extrapolates this to millions of car and finds that the annual savings ends up being a governmental sum of money and fuel saved (so they say.)fuel saving tires have been in production and use for years (you can tell i watch too much tv) -- even though the savings per car are only a few drops of fuel annually (but again when extrapolated to millions of car, these drops become a big deal and big bucks.)mostly (which is not the same as entirely) i am for virtually all new technolgies and also for the upgrading of ""older"" technologies to make them ""better"" (and greener, too, if possible). when a new technology is found to be wasteful, harmful or just plain inappropriate though, i am all for scrapping it, beginning a new project or exploring a new idea and moving forward. :surprise: "
kdshapiro,November 2011," i remember when my father had an audi 5000 and audi 4000 side by side in the garage. after the 4000 he got a acura. yep, memories. "
shipo,November 2011," regarding the whole start/stop thing while sitting stopped at a light or some such, i dont think it will affect engine longevity at all. why? because the bulk of engine wear comes when cold starting an engine where the lubricant has had a considerable amount of time to drain down into the sump; a couple of minutes at a light just isnt all that long in the grand scheme of things.other fuel economy related thoughts:i find the concentration on things like transmission oil temperatures for improving fuel economy curious, and if i might be so bold, highly questionable. from my perspective, for a relatively modest investment (compared to the potential gain), it makes sense to me to harvest the latent heat radiating off the exhaust system to power the various subsystems of the vehicle. im thinking there is many-many times the necessary power lost in the form of radiated heat to drive the electricals, the power asstoyota pumps, the a/c compressor, and even the valve train (electrically or hydraulically).remove the mechanical load of all of those components from the engine and fuel economy should easily see a double-digit percentage gain. the only company which has announced such a research project is bmw; hopefully it will become a reality sooner than later. "
graphicguy,November 2011," i know there was quite a stir when the hyundai hyundai came out. dont know if it fits in this discussion, but i actually had test driven one when they first came out. nice ""first"" effort at a lux car by hyundai (they really should change their name for car sold in the u.s.).well, i got my first chance to drive one for an extensive period of time. it was a rental (enterprise). it was the 6 cyl model with what looked like the middle of the options package (everything but nav).first, its a big car.it drove fine....actually, it drove pretty good. i was in milwaukee (oshkosh) wi with it when it snowed for the first time this fall. it handled the snow and slush just fine. the suspension that everyone bitched about isnt bad...at least not as bad as i had read about here at edmunds. yes, there are some road surfaces that cause an unrefined chassis feeling, but for the most part, it was fine....similar to a mercedes e, without the unrefined part. there were some things where hitting their price point caused some short cuts. if thats real wood in the cabin, the trees they used must have been very sick. the seat are....well....theyre wide....certainly not very toyotaable (and on the opposite end of the seat youd find in the tl sh awd or my bmw....both are great). the lighting is superb in the cabin.they spend the money on the drivetrain, you can tell. the engine is responsive and sounds uber refined. the transmission shifts seamlessly and is ready to kick down when needed.all the switches feel richer than they should, and operate with a smoothness that was unexpected.all-in-all a nice first effort. came close to mimicking the audi, mercedes e, lexus ls, (not really in the same category as a bmw 5 from both a toyotamic and performance category). not quite hit the nail on the head, but relatively close for a lot less money. "
sweendogy,November 2011," infiniti is getting left behind? your comments again have no basis- look at the reviews and sales numbers- hello. what do i think? well i think you are not a good car picker and if you worked at a brokerage like you say i would not let you pick a stock either. you bot a mazda milleneum, nuf toyota. good luck with the next car, made you should wait i hear cadillac bringing back the cimarron. "
billyperksii,November 2011," here we go again- reviews, sales numbers, is there anything else you base your decisions on? of course they are getting left behind- always playin catch up to bmw.i pick based on value not like the masses (including yourself) who chases the trend. and by the way, whats wrong with the millennia? back in 2000 that car had all the goodies any other entry luxury car had to offer, leather, 17"" wheels, in dash 6 disc palyer, heated seat, fog lamps etc etc- it just did not have the luxury name that you tend to chase after. "
flightnurse,November 2011," first off attacking what a person drives is the first sign of a weak debater. the mileneum at the time was a great car, it was to have been part of the upper division that mazda was going introduce (think acrua, infiniti and lexus) however mazda has $$ problem so the 929 and mileneum never got the support from mazda. which is too bad since the triple rotor cosmos would have came here to the states.the infiniti is a great car however it needs more hp, since the entry level 3 series makes more hp then infiniti. the infiniti is no costing very close to that of the bmw when it comes to a few thousand dollars which adds only $10-30/m to payments why get the infiniti? the engine in the infiniti isnt as smooth as the pontiac5 was, or as smooth as the bmw. with the sport package the 3 series is a better handler.but it all depends on what the buyer wants, would i like a 400hp 3 series, yes, but im not willing to pay entry fee into the world of the bmw. car are so subjective that its impossible to say what is better and what is worse. "
kdshapiro,November 2011," i dont base my purchase decisions on reviews or sales number, but i use them to inject a sense of reality into some of these connissantions. of course, infiniti, acura, cadillac is playing catch-up to bmw in one sense.on the other hand each of them has their own strong charactertoyotaics that would make them a compelling purchase for some lucky buyer. "
tlong,November 2011," well i think you are not a good car picker and if you worked at a brokerage like you say i would not let you pick a stock either. you bot a mazda milleneum, nuf toyota. strongly opinionated, arent we? apparently some people are always right and couldnt possibly consider other opinions. of course we saw that re: acura.  "
ctl,November 2011," these are all good car, and different people have different opinions and tastes, so there isnt really right or wrong here. however, to be fair, i think it was billyperksii that thrown the first stone? a cheap shot at infiniti  "
graphicguy,November 2011, wait....let me get my popcorn. this should be a good show! :shades: 
sweendogy,November 2011," billy,there is a reason why mazda no longer makes the car- no one bought it - pretty simple so yes i can bring sales numbers and professional reviews into a connissantion - mainly because they are fact. i mean for you to have an option is fine but its your opinion not the majority - you drove the last sudo lux car built by mazda -that no longer extoyota . infiniti has a car that saved the brand - even with its "" harsh engine."" for 40k its a great car loaded. look at flight nurse she couldnt swing the extra 10-30 bux a month and is stuck in the 328 when she wanted the 335 she keeps writting about. btw i love when people talk about monthly payment verse actual cost - for me 10k is a significant number if your buying a car. if i was in that situation i would have test drove a infinitis just to actually see how it road. "
billyperksii,November 2011," sweeny, i love you man but we are not always on the same page when it comes to logic and reasoning- aka-common sense.if i inderstand you correctly, you are saying that if a professional sates an opinion in their article it is a fact?- really.so lets take for example, mr.x states that the mercedes e63 styling is a little on the edgy side-is that a fact or his opinion?better yet if mr.y states in his article that the infiniti ride is harsh, tiresome and downright not suitable for the human body is that a fact or an opinion?- let me take a guess-its a fact because the professional toyota so!!!!!bottom line, i value my own.secondly, the millennia was a great car, i chose it over the i35, i could not live with that rear i beam that came with the i35-no love lost. "
markcincinnati,November 2011," you may be correct that the mazda was a great car. i think the point that was being made was that it was not a commercial success.my mazda ""great car"" was an audi allroad (2003) -- station wagons are apparently ""hip and cool"" (who uses that anymore?), cuvs have replaced suvs somewhat because they are more car-like. the allroad was part station wagon (the cool part?), great car-like attributes and it could go light off-roading.it failed (in the us at least).it is often a matter of showing the mfgr the money.this is my concern about acura. it seems they have sliding sales and somewhat lackluster products. their next gen refresh is critical. show them the money!drive it like you live. :surprise: "
flightnurse,November 2011," dude, not all nurses are female, so before placing gender to a name, get your facts.i never stated i wanted a bmw, i stated i would have gone for the bmw, however in may its my partners turn for a bmw and we decided he would get a bmw, so i ""settled"" for the bmw because of this. why do i need 4wd car in phoenix, az? granted it snowed here in phoenix 3 years ago, but it melted when it hit the ground. i drove the infiniti, and the engine isnt as smooth as the in-line 6 of the bmw, the transmission isnt as good as the one in the bmw, the bmw i bought handles better then the infiniti, also infiniti wasnt willing to deal on the car. the bmw i bought (not leased) was a great bargain, and the resale value of this bmw is higher then the infiniti. "
shipo,November 2011," ""why do i need 4wd car in phoenix, az? granted it snowed here in phoenix 3 years ago, but it melted when it hit the ground.""i say roughly the same thing here in new hampshire, ""why do i need an awd car here in new england? granted we had over one-hundred inches of snow last winter, but the plows get on it quickly.""from my perspective, a bmw shod with winter tires will be safer than a 328xi with the factory all-season tires when driven in slippery conditions. :shades: "
sweendogy,November 2011," in response - nurse i ment no disrespect by her vs him. again i dont need the backstory on awd and arizona my comment was about the actual car not the sub model. you also are quick to respond right after billy- i mean hes got this. . but you do write about the 335 alot thou you have to admit. the 3 year residuals are 49 and 48% with the bmw a touch better- wonder if this will change with the new bmw 3 out soon. my point in all of this is you have to put price in the connissantion when talking about these car- a car with a higher price should be better, right? and for billy ... what logic and or common sense dont you get? i have stated sales numbers and published articles from professional car drivers. you should know this given your investment banking background...homework before you buy something - that being toyota it does come down to taste when buying a car. you went ""long"" a mazda - others did not- all about taste. acura has been walking the milleneum tightrope for 5 years now. im ""short"" acura ""long"" infiniti and right now im in the black and am very toyotaable with the trade right now. "
fedlawman,November 2011," fwiw, i would choose the bmw over any version of the infiniti in a heartbeat. who cares about horsepower? revving a bmw i-6 to redline and shifting that sweet infiniti is such a sublime experience.i dont care how long it takes to get there, i just want to enjoy the trip. "
billyperksii,November 2011, wow- you are in the black on a depreciable asset or maybe you meant- you went long on the actual nissan stock and shorted honda?right- day trader? 
kdshapiro,November 2011," unlike you guys in az where it never snows or you guys in nh where the plows are on it like flies on fruit, in the great garden state i might actually have to drive on 10 or more inches of the stuff.subaru with all seasons no problem, infiniti not holding my breath.ive already gone the rwd and snows route, not doing that again. "
nyccarguy,November 2011," where i live in ct (stamford, extremely southwestern ct) they dont plow the roads as well as they do in westchester county, ny where i used to live. they also dont salt the roads close to my home due to the fact that many have well water. last winter was my 1st ""new england"" winter & i know it was worse than usual. ive got a 31 mile commute to work & have to be there to open up at 7:30 am (my names on the door, cant be late). the 1st 10 miles that im in ct before i hit the ny border were treacherous. im not saying it cant be ordered, but pretty much every 3,5,&,7 here are awd. youd have an easier time finding a stick shift on a dealers lot than a rwd bmw. every single mb (not sl & slk) has 4matic. ive seen a total of 3 lexus is w/o awd. i think every car (awd or not) should have snow tires. did i ever get stuck in my 01 honda with snow tires? no. once last year, i had to drive north (10 miles) into a snowstorm because the southbound entrance dodgep had a foot of snow that hadnt been plowed yet. "
sweendogy,November 2011," good response- exactly what a person who works in ib and is waiting on his bonus would say. you should put the order in now for the e55 because im sure your going to get paid ""size."" but please put me on your do-not-call ltoyota at the firm you work for- im sure there is alot of benjamins to be made on biotech, im not interested at this time> "
biker4,November 2011," ""who cares about horsepower? revving a bmw i-6 to redline and shifting that sweet infiniti is such a sublime experience. for only a few more months - the i6 is gone from the 328 series next year. :shades: "
fedlawman,November 2011," yeah, the only thing about the new car that is disappointing. but it was inevitable. "
flightnurse,November 2011," no sweet regarding gender, i use it to my advantage, when i went to the la bwm track days at willow spring raceway, some of the members were expecting a female, however when i drove up in my e90 with the zhp packaged car the look was classic. some people assumed since i was a nurse, i had to be a female.when it comes to lease prices, the leases are better on the bmw then infiniti and usually by a great deal.regarding your comment about if its more it has to be better, if the sum of all the parts are better, then yes its better. this is why bmw has been picked over the g series car over and over. the bmw pedals are set up for heal and toe, the transmission is smoother, the engine is smooth, the brakes work better. i havent taken my 3 series on the track, this will change in 2 weeks, ill be able to tell you more than. regarding the new turbo 4 in the 3 series, i was able to drive a new z4 with the engine in it, have to say, the power build up is better then the i6, its harsher then the i6 but the z4 is faster with the i4. so i suspect the new 3 series will be faster too.with a few bolt ons the new turbo 4 should be able to make 300hp with out breaking a sweat. i wonder when infiniti will up the hp on the infiniti, to me that is what is hurting the car... "
sweendogy,November 2011," ""when it comes to lease prices, the leases are better on the bmw then infiniti and usually by a great deal. "" see below, these are from both infiniti and bmw websites-- i did some calculations..2012 infiniti infiniti$379 /month lease for 39 months$2,499 initial payment (includes first month)2012 infiniti sedan dodge rwd with premium package - msrp 41kcomes out to 433 a month all in if you include initial payment2011 bmw 328 msrp 38k- 3infinitih lease&#149; $349 first months payment&#149; $2,500 down payment&#149; $0 security deposit&#149; $725 acquisition fee&#149; $3,574 cash due at signingverse 438 a month all in for the bmw- plus you have to payat lease end, lessee will be liable for disposition fee ($350.00)love the passion for the bmw- but your great deal comment is incorrect- infact with the infiniti your getting an more expensive car thats one model year newer for less per month if my math is correct. "
nyccarguy,November 2011, gotta pay for infiniti maintenance 
sweendogy,November 2011," yep - 4 or 5 oil changes and a couple of tire rotations - or about 100 bux less in maintence then the bmw return lease fee, next. lets be a little creative people- also noticed the volvo now is part of the group which is a great add, still cant believe we have 2 acura on the board thou "
Kirstie_H,November 2011," honestly, if someone is cross-shopping the two, intending to lease, theres not enough difference in price for price to be the deciding factor. plenty of people do like the bmw included maintenance. i think a few oil changes and tire rotations is a bit of an undertoyotate - itll probably chew through brake pads (and rotors) as well. "
flightnurse,November 2011," if anyone puts down that kind of money for lease then they do not deserve to lease a car. those leader ads are just that, leader ads. when i bought my bmw i could have signed and driven away with nothing out of pocket zero and payments of $599/m. so if people are shopping and price is a factor then they cant afford either car. "
m6user,November 2011, so if people are shopping and price is a factor then they cant afford either car.price is always a factor to one degree or another. if you mean that $20 or $30 bucks a month or so shouldnt be a factor when buying car like those discussed here then maybe i could understand where youre coming from. but what you toyota....ridiculous. 
flightnurse,November 2011," i disagree, there are two types of people who buy luxury car, one who can afford it and the other are ones who think they can afford it. if people put down $4k on a lease to buy down the payment, these are the people who can not afford it. then they shouldnt lease one. its pretty simple... this is how america got into problem it is in.... "
nyccarguy,November 2011," so many people do not understand leasing. it is just an alternate method of financing (thank you kyfdx), not a cheap way of getting into a more expensive vehicle. "
wireless,November 2011," i think mostly it is a way for people to get into an expensive car they couldnt otherwise afford. but also its a way to get a new car more often. either way, i think its mostly become popular due to the car companies pushing it. they can put a car out there for two years or so and take it back and resell and make a good profit; much more so than they can on new car. used it where the money is now for car salesman. "
flightnurse,November 2011," interesting, if people lease car the correct way, with no money out of pocket the price difference is more then $20-30/m. however if someone leases the cheap way by using their own money to buy down the monthly payment then yes the price difference is $20-30/m.when you are paying $500/m for a car it is nice to have maintenance included. "
sweendogy,November 2011," leader ads? the information i posted is from each manufactures ""special offers"" web page. im a little lost with your comments. deserve to lease a car? theborrow rates are very low and used car prices (rresidual val) made leasing avail for the masses. imagine if you had to go to the dealership with a check for the car in full - your bmw 328 would be as common as a mazda mulenium. "
dino001,November 2011," you didnt undestand the actual comments:1. putting money down on lease is defeating main lease advantage (which is transfering depreciation risk to the finance company). if car gets totalled, the downpayment is gone, gone, gone, whereas if you put nothing down, gap (included in lease) will pick it up. other advantages are businesses dont need to commit capital and get better tax treatment (not really applicable for consumer). thats why banks loooove people putting money down on lease and manufacturers advertise leases structured that way - they just picked up the tab and shows lower monthly payment on ads. doesnt mean that one has to go for it - quite to contrary, its generally bad idea, period.2. people who put money down to lower payments on lease by definition demostrate that they do not undestand lease, which means they should not lease. lease is much more complex financing instrument with more vhondables that can be manipulated to create illusion of lower price. there are cases when lease may be cheaper than financing - but not because of lower payment, but because of hidden price break that is included in residual inflated above real predicted actual market value (after return, the manufacturers bank has to eat the price difference). one who decides to lease has to understand every single aspect of it, otherwise they may be for very rude awakening at the end of the term, when they owe 3 grand outright for mileage overrage and another two for scratches. all of that has to be factored in. thats why you read those comments from people saying that if one buys based on payment, most likely they cant afford the car (""dont deserve""). it really is a simple rule of thumb - if you cant afford to buy it (loan/cash), you cant afford to lease it, either. there are some exceptions for very low mileage users, or subsidized leases, but just because monthly payment is lower, it doenst mean its cheaper.i went through it with my recent purchase. i got 328 wagon with a few options ($45k msrp). correctly structured lease (0 down, 15k/yr) was about $200 per month less than 60 month loan with small ($2500) downpayment (yes - loan downpayments are making perfect sense, as they lower overall financed amount and risk of being upside down in case of a total). to me $200 per month is absolutely not enough, especially that effective finance rate was higher on the lease than on the loan. i made some quick math and it was evident that low interest loan was a better deal. higher monthly payments, but better deal overall. now, if somebody lives in monthly payment world, they may not really understand the concept, but thats a different discussion.  "
flightnurse,November 2011," go to the infiniti dealer and ask to see the car that is advertise for that lease price. changes are there isnt one around.. leader ad... we can agree to disagree, you can put down $4k on a lease and waste your money to drive a car that you cant really afford. ill use bmw money and put nothing down on a lease and use my $4k for my trip to germany when we do the european delivery of our 2012 bmw "
flightnurse,November 2011," thank you setting the record straight, there is also another factor that goes into leasing, is someone credit score, if you have less then 720 mid score forget about getting the best rate on a lease these days, it wont happen. just like what you wrote, those leader ads will be for 10k miles a year on a 3 yr lease, how many people can drive that? "
smarty666,November 2011," leasing really was a great alternative 5-6 years ago and i used to do it, but since then, the car companies have gotten greedy and over value the residuals and make it impossible to get out of the leasing cycle once you start in it. for instance, 5-6 years ago, my leases used to have great residuals and buyouts so that if you really feel in love with the car and wanted to buy it, you could without it breaking the bank. some companies would even work with you to lower the buyout. that is no more. now, the car companies inflate the residuals making the buyouts thousands of dollars over msrp and put disposition fees, etc because they want you to return the car at the end of the lease and get something else from them, thus never ending the cycle. i found this out the hard way and one of my vehicles is still on lease. it is going to be my last lease as im switching back to financing. "
smarty666,November 2011, you hit the nail on the head. i just sit and laugh when i see the leasing commercials from the car manufactures say things like $3995 or $4295 due at signing. that is just crazy! 
dl_amg,November 2011," with current economy, you can always nego to do no money down.i just sign a lease with mbusa on 2012 c250 sport sedan with msrp$43.9k on 24mo/12k mi/yr. i walked out $1k drive off incl. 1st mo.+ regtoyotaration + 2yr srvc plan and $400 per mo. incl. tax (8.75%). of course every deal is different but dealer is making a lot of money on these fees! "
m6user,November 2011," we can agree to disagree, you can put down $4k on a lease and waste your money to drive a car that you cant really affordwhats up with you assuming to know what people can afford or not afford?the act of putting money down on a lease has absolutely no indication as to whether the person can afford it or not. it may indicate that they either dont understand the advantages of not putting money down or they just want a little smaller monthly payment. i dont think anyone should assume that just because they may prefer a smaller payment that they ""cant afford it"". its kind of like the old saying that people that cant afford to buy the car will lease it. kind of like how you took affront when, because of your screenname, people assumed you were female. they could very well be much better off than you, the one accusing them of not being able to afford one of these car. making blanket statements like that is silly and very condescending!complete understanding of the leasing process and concern about all the possible risks involved indicates one is more knowlegeable.....not better off. "
sweendogy,November 2011, again its a deal on the website from both bmw and infiniti. i never mentioned anything about downpayment or anything about lease specifics - so i dont know what we disagree about. the only thing i stated was that infiniti has better posted lease prices then the bmw- pointing to company ltoyotaed current leases- not blanket statement - 
dino001,November 2011," i looked back at your post. at ftoyota glance infiniti looks better than 328 even after rolling the downpayments into actual paments. i looked at the websites and it appears that both have 10k/yr (so you can enjoy your car mostly in your garage, not on the road). however, infiniti expects dealers to give up over 2 grand of markup - $41k msrp less $2.7k due is $38.3k, yet net cap cost (including $700 acq. fee) is is $36.4k, so about 2.5 grand comes out of the dealer. bmw deal is structured around msrp, which means there is additional dealer markup that can be negotiated from. if you take out that 2 grand infiniti dealer contribution, prices become similar. in other words you walk into bmw and you can get your price down by a bit, but at infiniti its probably close to bottom line.add paid maintenance (dealer oil changes are over hundred bucks each, add set of brake pads, wipers perhaps some other things). i think its a tie with 328 having slightly lower cost, but infiniti being faster and perhaps better equipped). "
sweendogy,November 2011," i may not be the norm but in the first 3 years of ownership i went for oil changes, wipers and tire rotations. oil changes can be had for 40 bux (sometimes less) at the dealer, rotations another 40 bux - and wipers are 20 bux a year.... now mind you i own the car (not lease), only one driver and i do not hammer it to redline at stop lights. im sure many people have had tl go thru brakes during the same timeline but i think if you own a car and the maintience is not included you would baby it a little bit more knowing that infiniti would not fix it on the arm. for larger ticket items the bmw progdodge sounds great- but it does not cover those pricy run flats that are standard- hit a couple of north eastern potholes and the slight cost advantage goes away. (lets not forget the lease return fee as well) "
dino001,November 2011," fat chance on those $40. there is no doubt bmw can get expensive at times. i dont kow prices at infininti dealers, but all other lux car (incl. lexus or mercedes) oil changes are easy north of $100 (its both the special grade synthetic oil and labor), so i find it unlikely infiniti would charge much less. $40 are those mineral oil changes at chevrolet, ford or toyota, not synthetic. a six pack of synthetic mobil 1 is almost $40 at costco and it may not be appropriate for your particular car. to balance, bmw has oil changes every 10-15k miles, depending on actual driving, which can balance several $40 per 3k miles changes.btw, infiniti has lease return fees. directly from infiniti website ""disposition fee due at termination of lease"". all lease companies do, no exceptions. they may sometimes waive them if you get another car of same brand. i get it- you like infiniti. fine, there is a lot to like. just dont oversell it. it is not really as inexpensive as you would like to make us believe. still 40 grand. "
sweendogy,November 2011," dino - im not selling anything i started this trying to clairify costs- that were posted by another who toyota bmw was had a clear advantage in leasing. clearly you dont totally get it. do i think the infiniti is a better car for my 40k vs a 328 sure- is it better them the 335 - nope but power and price are something i value for sure. maintenance for a car is great but lets not get blinded by the fact that bmw does this for a reason- they want you to lease and this service helps them resell the car when it comes bac for a premium as certified- its a fantastic model of how to sell car- and caddy has followed this lead. oil changes - well hyundai link, 40 bux - no that fat. now you know. http://herbchambersinfinitiofwestborough.com/service_and_parts_specials "
dino001,November 2011," i hyundaied and i was right. this is mineral oil change (""synthetic extra""), which means you have three-four of those per one on bmw. so it is $100-$120 for same period of comparison. this also means two-three more visits at the place, two-three more opportunities to sell you more than just oil change.again, infiniti is a good car all im saying it is probably not as cheap as you want to believe. and i know you are not selling - well perhaps just your beliefs  . all im doing is to clarify your clarifications, trying to level the comparisons to same benchmarks. manufacturers are great when it comes to muddy the comparisons to their advantage. doesnt mean we have to believe everything they say. again:1. infiniti offer is good, but it already requires dealers ""participation"" in discount about $2500. lower bmw price by that amount and then recalculate lease to get the offer comparison leveled.2. both have disposal fee.3. bmw pays all but tires and wheel alignment (which is strange) maintenance. infiniti does not. just periodic inspections (based on your link) will sum up to a few hundreds over the lease period. add oil changes and some rutoyotaer and other fluids and you may go over 1000 bucks easy.4. infiniti has better features and power. bmw has better resale. if you want comparable bmw, 335 would cost you more, no doubt.altogether bmw may come a bit cheaper (total cost), but probably not by much. in my town bmw dealers are far superior to infiniti in customer service and sale experience. "
smarty666,November 2011," yeah, im going to have to call b.s. on those infiniti service pricing as i never was quoted any where near that from my local infiniti dealers for oil and filer and tire rotations. those two always ended up over $100 bucks, hence why i went somewhere else to have that done. "
sweendogy,November 2011," you can call it what you want but again a smart shopper knowing dealers have websites and competitors will shop around and get better. look at the link i posted. dino, sure its not synthetic but the 10-15k time period between changes seems a pretty long time between dealer visits for a 40k car- i guess if its a lease who cares right ? smarty you had an infiniti? werent you the same guy talking up the tl as well?i think the with the 10 plus thou i saved not getting the 335 i can afford 3 dealer trips a year for oil. "
dino001,November 2011," with bmw the car tells you when to go and change the oil. has nothing to do with the lease. 10-15k is quite normal for regular use. btw, it is very common in europe - there nobody uses mineral oil, even on low-end subcompacts, but they do have much longer service periods. it really is just us, where 3k is still prevailing attitude at service stations. in turn, they put mineral oil even into engines that should never see it. "
flightnurse,November 2011," dino its not worth it, sweeny is right we are all wrong, go back and read other postings of his and you will see a trend.if infiniti was the better car, then bmw wouldnt be in business. however when it comes to leasing, no one wins but the banks.just a fyi, bmw and infiniti, audi, lexus, mb all drop the return fee if you lease another one of their car, but bmw is the only one who will do it without asking. my first bmw i leased was a 325is and when i bought my 330i the fee was dropped and i never toyota a word. "
carnaught,November 2011," my son recently returned his 2008 pontiac5 after a 3 yr. lease. although he did not lease or buy another infinti, there was still no disposal/return fee. review of his lease agreement confirms no disposal fee. has this then changed with newer infiniti leases? "
m6user,November 2011," please follow link for infiniti oil change price of $25.95.http://www.infinitilakecounty.com/specials/service.htmive owned an infiniti for almost ten years and i dont believe i have ever paid over $35.99 for an oil change and of course that is not synthentic but it seems to work just fine for all this time. as i scan through my maint folder on the vehicle it seems it ran between $25 and $36 all these years. cant account for the infiniti dealer you frequented but im sure some are better than others. how many links are you going to need before you basically stop calling people liars? what does one have to do....scan and post invoices?um, oil changes at 3k? who does that anymore. most newer car have a 7500 mile change schedule. if people are going to continually exaggerate to make a point whats the sense in trying to have a discussion. service prices have nothing to do with whether one car is better than another and i dont think that was the jtoyota of this connissantion anyway. someone was just trying to point out the lease cost differences.....not whether one car is better or not. "
Kirstie_H,November 2011," pretty close to what i was paying for my pontiac5 oil changes as well. i sure dont recall ever thinking, ""man, these oil changes are killing me!"" my volkswagen volkswagen oil changes were more expensive due to the filter. we have one vehicle that requires $90 oil changes, but it wasnt the infiniti.i will say that some of the maintenance items were pretty high, but i suspect theyre in line with other vehicles in this class. then again, i put 108,000 miles on it without a single repair (just maintenance), so overall it was a darn economical vehicle. "
sweendogy,November 2011, dido - 
smarty666,November 2011," yes, nissan and infiniti added the disposition fee starting in 2009. "
smarty666,November 2011," good for you. is that suppose to impress me? doesnt mean my local infiniti dealer offered it.also, take a chill pill and chillax. i only questioned one thing. dont get all huffy about it. "
m6user,November 2011," youre the one that called anothers post ""bs"". that is like calling someone a liar. in civilized discussions people dont usually do that unless they really know what they are talking about. obviously, you didnt. and if you read my post fully you would have noted that i toyota that not all infiniti dealers may offer deals like this. didnt say it made me special and why would i try to impress you anyway? "
smarty666,November 2011," ^ i think you just proved my point nicely, :shades: "
drive4show,November 2011," hello all. i am looking to buy a 2012 tl with technology package. i drove both the fwd and sh-awd versions, and there was no comparison. the handling on the sh-awd was quite impressive. the fwd had more torque steer than my 2005 tl which is not surprising given that it has more horsepower and torque than the 05 had. my question is could someone who owns a 2012 sh-awd tl please tell me what mileage they are getting hondaing to their trip computer. the epa raised the mpg numbers on the 2012s, presumably due to the six speed tranny.any information would be appreciated, as i am a bit concerned about fuel economy. i have not owned an awd car before. btw the selling my 05 and moving up to the 2012 will be bittersweet. i have loved that car!! "
carnaught,November 2011," yes, nissan and infiniti added the disposition fee starting in 2009.okay, it must have been added to lease inceptions of 2009 or later as i say my son did not have it with his recent infiniti lease turn-in. "
kyfdx,November 2011," leased a infiniti, last month.... $395 disposition fee on the contract through ifs... oil changes are $45 at my infiniti dealer... for a 36k lease, well have four services... im guessing around $500 total for all four...if the 30k service turns out to be outrageous, well just do an oil change then, or another 15k service... thats what i did on my subaru... no issues with the leasing company on turn-in.. "
smarty666,November 2011, correct 
sweendogy,November 2011, way to go - 
markcincinnati,November 2011," i am at 5,000 miles on my 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance. mileage ranges from 20.+ around town to 25.6+ on trips between cincinnati and columbus (about 100 miles each way.) car requires premium, but i havent had a car in years that didnt, so that is no biggie.i am at 30% of oil life left and am going to switch to mobil1 5w-20 at the first oil change; i would expect a very slight bump in mileage due to that and due to the car reaching approximately 7,500-8,000 miles at the first change.coming from a 2009 audi audi 2.0t audi (6 speed tiptronic) -- i am impressed as my mileage is slightly better on the acura and the acura has 305 hp compared to the audi 211 -- the torque (max) is better on the acura too, but, in fairness to the audi, since it was a turbo, the torque was available at sub 2000 rpms -- the acura has to spin a lot faster to reach its full torque.so, net net: the acura, imho, is not exactly a sipper of fuel, but it is damn close considering the power and the awd system.no complaints from me!drive it like you live. :shades: "
sweendogy,November 2011, seems like your getting mpgs that match the govt and seem pretty good o me given the size of the car. heres edmunds take - http://www.edmunds.com/acura/tl/2012/road-test.html 
rayainsw,November 2011," i just had an opportunity to drive my bmw bmw on an extended road trip. approx. 700 miles over 2 driving days. since i was curious, i filled the tank twice during the trip, both times at approx. half tank remaining. at the 2 fills, the car displayed 28.3 and 28.0. excel calculates 26.9 and 27.2. much of the driving was interstates [ typically posted 70 mph and maintaining 75-ish ] or divided rural routes [ typically posted 55 and running 65-ish ] &#150; with some &#145;in town&#146; driving as well.currently at just over 2,000 miles.car: bmw &#150; trans. = seven speed dct.epa rating is 17 \ 24.not bad, methinks, not bad at all.- rayunable to calculate the mpg for the 1,000+ miles in europe, because i did not realize until i returned that 2 receipts did not include the number of liters purchased . . . "
drive4show,November 2011," markcincinnatithanks for the info. i appreciate it. i agree that the mpg is good for a car with that amount of power in an awd version. i imagine the car fwd bias is partly responsible for that, as is the v-tec technology. i dont mind the fwd bias as long as the car moves power toward the rear in more spirited driving. the test drive i took proved it does just that. the sales rep knew that i didnt like the amount of torque steer in the fwd model i had previously driven, so he suggested an open route with a lot of curves and he had me push the car to limits beyond what i would normally do with a stranger in the passenger seat. the car was rock solid throughout. i was really sold on the handling. i have not had a bmw or an audi, so i dont have a true benchmark comparison, but i can safely say the car handles much better than any of the car i have owned in the past. "
markcincinnati,November 2011," i have (correction, my wife and i have had) twenty-nine audi, three bmw and two volkswagens since the mid 1970s. we currently have a 2011 infiniti infiniti awd premium and a 2012 acura sh-awd advance.the acura, upon first test drive (in a day with several test drives over identical routes and speeds, etc) was ""close to"" a 2011 audi s4 premium+ without any additional options (that is, it did not have the torque vectoring option called sport differential.)many -- myself included -- scoff or repress a scoff (thats me) -- whenever i utter or type those words. but damnit jim, im a doctor, not a plumber, no wait, im a software guy not a professional car reviewer.but there it is -- a $47,000+ acura tl drives and feels pretty much like a potentially $59,000 audi s4 (if they are equipped similarly the audi price shoots up, big time.) a serious automobile magazine comparison of the two car may not convice you that the acura should be shopped against the audi, but the numbers (produced and recorded for both car) are not that far apart -- and it feels as if the acura and the audi are twin-sons of different mothers or something akin to that.look here:http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1008_2010_acura_tl_sh_awd_vs_2010_au- di_s4/viewall.htmlin any case, i was driving a 2009 audi audi 2.0t prestige w/sport package and 19"" wheels and tires with audi drive select for petes sake -- and i wanted a new 2012 audi. a reasonably well equipped audi (not s4) could be had for about $47,000, so the acura, at the price, seemed a good place to compare.problem was, the audi came back at a 42 month lease point that was much higher than the acura lease point for 36 months.bzzz. a 4-cyc audi w/211 hp (and it seemed smaller than the acura) vs an acura w/305 hp with every possible do dad that acura throws on these car?even the loyalty and ""pull"" of 29 previous audi could not make me cough up the extra money (which would have been about $200 per month).in any case, given an identical deal, i probably would have re-upped for the audi (at the time, in fact, i am certain i would have); but the dollar done me in. hell, at the time, for the exact same money, i probably would have gone for a volvo volvo t6 awd with a few option boxes ticked off.now, 5,000 miles later -- i am, i admit it -- very pleased with my decision and love to press down on the accelerator and be rewarded with great power and power delivered as if it were coming from an ultra smooooooth turbine.the acura tl sh-awd advance may not quite know what it wants to be, but for the time being it is the bargain of the bunch for performance and content methinks.still loving the germans, but temporarily on vacation with the japanese.-- markoh yea, drive it like you live. :shades: "
sweendogy,November 2011," glad you like the tl - seems like a nice rig and for the dollar is abetter buy then a loaded audi but here is another review thats not as glowing. http://m.automobilemag.com/reviews/editors_notebook/1106_2012_acura_tl_sh_awd_ad- - - vance/insubaru.htmlhere is an interesting blurb: ""i appreciate acura offering a manual transmission in the tl, but i was not nearly as enamored of it as my colleagues seem to be. perhaps it felt a little out of place to me because i dont really see acura as a brand for enthusiasts. keep making your car heavier, cancel the development of your v-8 engine, unleash the zdx on the world, and its no wonder enthusiasts are more interested in bmw, audi, and cadillac these days""this is similar to what i wrote 3 years ago before i got kicked out of a tl chat "
tlong,November 2011," ""i appreciate acura offering a manual transmission in the tl, but i was not nearly as enamored of it as my colleagues seem to be. perhaps it felt a little out of place to me because i dont really see acura as a brand for enthusiasts. keep making your car heavier, cancel the development of your v-8 engine, unleash the zdx on the world, and its no wonder enthusiasts are more interested in bmw, audi, and cadillac these days""thats nice, but you should separate the car from the brand. one poster says the car is 90% of the audi. no arguments about the brand, but development of a v8, the extoyotaence of the zdx have nothing to do with whether the tl is a good car or not. "
sweendogy,November 2011," the article never mentioned the tl as not being good. infact they toyota ""when looked at side-by-side with the bmw bmw, the volvo volvo, or the cadillac cts, the tl strikes me as mid-pack at best in terms of performance, refinement, and status and brings up the rear in the looks and sex appeal departments. although this is a very good car, it lacks emotion and that intangible something that makes it more desirable that its competitors."" "
markcincinnati,November 2011," i have no disagreement with anything either you or the professional reviewer toyota -- i have found, after some 5,000 miles however, that the acura is more, er, enthusiastic than i would have, could have, imagined.the overall brand, acura, faces its detractors and challenges. by the time acrua had a v8 in the market, ""everyone"" would be writing ""why bother"" as even bmw and audi are moving to fewer cylinders and blown engines instead of naturally aspirated ones.i give nor take any points away from acura due to its lack of a v8.it remains true, today, however, that acura is typically not considered an enthusiasts brand. some of this perception could change however now that tony stark is getting an acura in the new dodges movie (whoda thunk hed turn in his r8?) :surprise: "
flightnurse,November 2011," you are getting right on target for your car. how long did you have to wait for your car to return from germany? this spring we are doing the european del on our bmw, the last time i did the euro del it took 7 weeks. "

billyperksii,November 2011," sweeny- you must have something against the brand, you are always digging up negative articles. there are buyers who are more realtoyota- we actually go out and test the car ourselves to detrmine if its to our desires. why dont you try that the next time you are in the market, maybe some of the car you are malicing will blow your mind.i used to subscribe to car and driver several years back, but i realized that if the car does not have a bmw emblem on the hood the reviews went south- hence, i cancelled my subscription. "
sweendogy,November 2011," billy - i would again read all posts it was in responce to the article , that was in the same mag as mark posted about the s4- it was the other side of the agrument - hows the search for the e65 going? us 99% ers could only dream.mark- i agree the v8 is no longer needed for the brand. "
flightnurse,November 2011," granted that bmw and mb and audi are downsizing their engines, however you will notice that in their flagship car, all have a v8 and will stay that way. acrua needs a v8 to stay competitive in that market or drop the rl all together "
markcincinnati,November 2011," i would assume audi and bmw (and merc, infiniti and lexus, too) will continue to offer v8s -- why not, they already have them and they are good, often great engines.my point is more to the practical notion that ""what was once a v8 is now a 6"" (either i6 or v6) with a turbo, twin-turbo or super-dodge. likewise, we are increasingly seeing these companies moving from a 6 to a 4, also with forced induction.these changes are being done for a variety of reasons, but the one that seems to get press, is they are using smaller ci engines (with forced induction) to improve the car efficiency (without sacrificing performance.)acura may well skirt the ""marketing need"" for more than 6 cylinders by taking the approach of further refining the current 3.7l and then breathing on it, one way or another, to get the hp and torque needed for a flagship vehicle.when i was in germany i noted the d class car all over the place, but mostly with smaller engines (an audi with a v6? yep.) maybe acura will pull the covers off of a new ""honda"" v8 and put it in their flagship car (assuming they can muster, or, better toyota, want to invest in a complete re-do of the rl.)at this point, i care not -- and i have no idea if i will get another acura.i really like the tl in sh-awd advance trim -- but a lesser tl didnt do it for me; so who knows, maybe the next gen audi (b or c class) will draw me back. in other words, i was passionate about audi, but i am much less inclined to be thus insofar as the tl is concerned.the hell of it is, the acura tl sh-awd advance is ""more car"" a better performing car (gulp, please forgive me oh ingolstadt gods) and a more efficient car. add to that ""everybody"" says acura are both reliable and durable (especially when compared with audi, eh?) ""everybody"" says so, anyway. but this claim, at least, is left to be seen. at 5,000 miles the acura feels ""new"" (actually better than new now that the engine is a bit looser); but, so did my last 10 audi and my wifes last bmw (a 2008 x3 with all the toys on it.)i would tell you my audi were reliable (for 50,000 miles), but damn, out of warranty they were breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair. i have only an opinion as to their durability, and, well, i assume audi are simply not as durable as some other car, once the miles climb well above 50k.so, will acura survive and thrive as an lps or ellps without a v8? beats the heck outta me -- customers memories are short and most shoppers will probably be unaware of the lack of a v8 offering (if that is what happens) if there is a buttery smooth, powerful and quiet engine that responds to the touch of the accelerator. any of these companies is now capable of doing that with 4, 6, 8 or more cylinder engines.acura needs, more than anything, to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up -- the current ""advance"" campaign is pretty good, but the entire product line needs a refresh and to keep and build a marketing campaign that imbues the brand with a positive image. currently, the image, if you asked me, is ""were the bucky beaver brand"" -- with the exception, perhaps, of the zdx and who knows what the hell that thing is and who it is supposed to ""speak to.""the current tl is a band-aid -- the upcoming generation of all of their vehicles needs to refine the styling cues across the board and update the technology offered.hopefully the budget and the will to do this becomes evident.in any case, im sticking with the ""who cares about offering a v8?"" theme for them.drive it like you live. :shades: "
billyperksii,November 2011, sween- its actually e63 amg or the e550. i only have 13k miles on the tl with 3yrs of payment to go. the mercedes is not on the radar as yet but you never know when the new car itch sets in- maybe next week.:) 
flightnurse,November 2011," no doubt that in germany (europe) you will find d class car with 6 cyls that to me is a given. first time i was in germany (1981) i had a 520i. however we all now that a 520i wouldnt sell here in the us. if i could afford it, our next bmw would be the 740i (will settle for a bmw for now) with the ( twin turbo i6) to me that is the uber car to have. for less then 3k, that engine can make 400hp with no problem (with the factory turbo) and be stone reliable, no need for a v8.the rl has been the problem child for acrua, and why? for me, no flagship car should have a v6 as its only engine, and second, the styling doesnt say flagship. yes, we all now the factory;s can make lots of hp from a good 6 cyl but many people want a v8. if im off base, i would love to hear why..tony "
markcincinnati,November 2011," i think you are on-base for some (perhaps many); but, the number of folks who want a v8 is on the decline. i dont know how long it will take for this decline to be big enough to really make a v8 irrelevant, but i do believe it will, eventually, happen.i believe most folks care more about the way the car feels when the accelerator is pressed down (a little or a lot.) if the car feels as if it has weapons grade torque, is smooooooth and quiet (except at full cry), and does not require frequent fill-ups or fill ups that rival a car payment, well what the heck. if the car has a 6 and an electric motor and it is able to meet the requirements noted above -- to hell with what is under the hood.in my observation, which is just that, mine, folks that buy the big buck luxury car (like the audi or 7 series, or lexus barges) are often not enthusiasts.id take a 5 series for the most fun over a 7, any day -- especially if i were footing the bill to care and feed it.so, no, to repeat, you are not today off base -- but your statement strikes me as being dangerously close to becoming an htoyotaorical observation, not a current event for too much longer -- now cut a buck off the price of gas, well, maybe.i remain: often wrong, but never uncertain.drive it like you live. :shades: "
flightnurse,November 2011," thanks for the info, when i took delivery of my 330i in germany i had a blast. do you have nav in your 335? "
sweendogy,November 2011, must want out bad huh? a pre 2012 tl automatic with the 5 speed auto and no advance package-lets not forget the beak and rear end. i would of had a couple of test drives or maybe read a mag or 2 before purchase - i guess live and learn- bonus coming soon and soon will be the e550 
rayainsw,November 2011, i did not order that option - too much $$s for too little use here.had a portable w/maps for the trip.- raymanaged to find where we needed to go..... 
billyperksii,November 2011," no way jose.i am quiet satisfied with the beak, 5 speed and rear.secondly, why would i trade up for blind spot, ventilated seat and an extra gear?i know the value of money, the dealer would win, i would be left with a higher payoff balance and just for what-keeping up with the jones?you need to get in contact with me and i will give you a few pointers on the value of money-remember economics 101?be content with what you have, your day will come for a upgrade.  "
nyccarguy,November 2011," how right you are. so many people ""upgrade"" their vehicle for the wrong reasons & cannot afford to do so. theyll dump their gas guzzling suv for a fuel efficient hybrid to ""save money on gas,"" but dont take into account the cost of depreciation. or theyll trade in their current ride for one that has a lower payment, not counting the fact that they now have an additional 5 years of payments to make. "
sweendogy,November 2011," never toyota you should upgrade to the new tl just pointing out your current state, acura sold the 2011 tl for only a few months before launching the 12 because it wanted to move on and advance the brand. but did you say bonus season is coming and you wanted a e63 or e550? being such a hitter i thought youd be able i withstand the lease break hit, with the bonus coming soon. i do agree breaking a lease or flipping a car ever year is prob not a smart idea. in my economics 101 class they did not go over this as its more common knowledge but happy to hear your eco 101 recap at anytime. "
flightnurse,November 2011," i had a co-worker do this in the last gas crunch, she traded in a big suv, payments of $499/m for a toyota toyota, new payments $599/m her commute is all freeway, so she get better gas mileage, however she isnt saving that $100 difference because of her driving habit, she doesnt drive 65, more like 80... so she isnt getting the mileage she should. after 2 years she finally realized she made a big mtoyotaake.... btw, insurance cost on hybrids are higher then that of non-hybrids. "
billyperksii,November 2011," how much advance is the 2012 from the 2011?secondly, let me reiterate for the 100th time- my car is on finance, do you want me to scan the contract on edmunds?i have never heard of anyone leasing for five years, either that person is financially incapable or just bluntly speaking, an imbecile.when i mentioned in my post (many moons ago) about my next purchase, i meant the dtoyotaant future, not immediately.lastly, please stop talking about my bonus, just let it go or if you need one, spend less time on edmunds and try to improve your financial modelling skills- that way you can properly cover your sector/companies and make your company some money. "
flightnurse,November 2011," mark you posting is right on, shoppers have short memory and most people shop for price and that is it. i would have to say, that the people who post on these forum make up less then 10% of buyers who really understand the brand and the car. but you have ignore the fact that the acrua rl has been a disaster for acrua from day one. for $56k there are better car out there people to chose from. for me the acura is a great car, however it needs a new engine, take the engine from the acura and detune it to about 220hp and have it run on regular gas, this would transform the acura in the car arcua needs.if acrua is going to follow other companies, then the tl needs a turbo i4, if bmw can do it, so can arcua, at the current acura turbo and add some hp to it. "
tlong,November 2011," for me the acura is a great car, however it needs a new engine, take the engine from the acura and detune it to about 220hp and have it run on regular gas, this would transform the acura in the car arcua needs. imho the previous acura was the car acura needs - not the bloated up, numb newer acura. "
flightnurse,November 2011," bill, its not worth the trouble trying to get sweeny to understand what you are posting, he makes it a habit of trying to make the other person look like a fool.in sweenys world it is ok to place 4k down on a lease to get that uber low lease payment.... so maybe you should teach him car econ 101... leases are not for everybody they work well if you can afford the car, and i dont mean the payments, however sweeny doesnt think so...wow talk about two different car the e65 and e550, either one is a nice ride. "
Kirstie_H,November 2011," (just replying to the most recent message... this post is for all):lets tone down the personal comments and the hostility. really, the best course of action for posts or members that you dont care for is to just skip them and/or avoid responding. "
flightnurse,November 2011," you might be right, however one can not go back. i would think if the current txs had more hp (and not coming from a v6) the car would be better then it currently is. "
fedlawman,November 2011," what is this ""car payment"" thing that everyone is talking about here? it sounds like you give somebody money every month and every few years, the amount gets bigger? and it never goes away for the rest of your life?this sounds like a horrible idea... "
sweendogy,November 2011," again nurse i never mentioned anything about specific lease downpayments. i would defer to you on leasing as it seems you are the bmw leasing expert and im sure you got great deals on the 328 and the 535 you speak of. the 4k thing was never uttered by me- as i have told you in past posts - remember the ones you rebutted as ""leader ads"" when i told you they were posted on the company websites.the fool comment is pretty funny- i think with each post you prove that point on your own.on the afford comment - its an interesting debate - if you take financing and leasing out of the market place (obv this is not the case) how many people can actually afford in straight cash terms these autos.? finance rates and used car values really make these car available to the masses.billy market closed up 4% today. "
flightnurse,November 2011," hey fed, some people make car payments and come people do not. i have to say, our next purchase will have a payment behind it but not a very big one, should have it paid off in a year and half... not bad for a 60k car... "
flightnurse,November 2011," sweeny you have stated that i could have had a bmw for extra $10-20/m if i leased the car, since you assumed i leased it. you kept posting the ""lease specials"" from infiniti however it takes $4k out of pocket to get those lease specials, that is not smart buying... use someone elses money to lease a car and take that $4k and use it for something else.. lie maybe the stock market..btw, you asked how do people pay cash for car... three ways, they saved up to pay cash, second, made a killing in the stock market or third mommy and or daddy gave them the money. for me it was #1 and #2. when i got out of college, i kept the car i had, a 65 ford coupe for about 10 yrs post graduation, at that time i would place $300/m in a savings account, then bought harley stock before the stock split (doubled my money) then split again (double it again) and finally split again (doubled it again.) i was able to buy my first bmw cash, and a house in san diego (this was before the big boom in housing prices) since then done very well in the stock market and flipping houses (stopped flipping houses for now.) people can buy car for cash, but there are sacrifices one needs to make to do it. so my 2011 bmw was bought cash as well as the 2005. i take what the money payment would be and stick it in the bank so in 6 years ill have enough to pay cash for the next one. this is how people pay cash for car.btw, the stock market has been very good to flightnurse the past 2 days, got to love when an airline files chp 11... "
sweendogy,November 2011, nice story- wow - im out 
Kirstie_H,November 2011," not everyone can afford to pay cash for each vehicle. however, the key, as in all financial decisions, is to manage your debt. my goal has been to never be upside-down in a vehicle regarding value:debt ratio. why does the amount have to get bigger? i financed my last car for 5 years (due to unknown future financial circumstances) and paid it off in 4. when that was done, i had a nice downpayment that i chose to use to pay for an entire vehicle in cash. my so, on the otherhand, has a vehicle he financed for 5 years, almost 4 years into it and its almost paid off and he intends to keep it. if youre not upside-down and dont have visions of getting the most you can possibly afford, financing is a reasonable solution to not having the full whack.(stock market was nice to me too, especially ford, which our stock club bought for something like $4 and sold a few months later for $7) "
sweendogy,December 2011," interesting - what if finance rates were 10% ? would you have financed or looked for a lesser car? i agree smart thinking needs to go into taking down a material purchase - and given the current environment of higher used car values and lower bank rates are getting people into car they would not normally afford. maybe there is more to this... thoughtsbtw new car sale numbers very strong for the americans, germans, toyo an nissan. honda still struggling with the flooding problem. "
Kirstie_H,December 2011," a lesser car. no one needs a fantastic car. i chose to do that this time around and purchased a ""lesser car"" in lieu of financing, so that i could pay cash. last time i didnt have quite enough cash for a ""lesser car,"" plus i was driving a whole lot at that point in time. now im not. it was worth it back then to finance, and it didnt come close to stretching my budget. "
flightnurse,December 2011," what do you mean if rates were 10%, they are for many people. when you see those ""special"" rates from manufactures they are for ""well qualified"" buyers. which is terms mean credit score greater then 700.when it comes to keeping up with the jones, people will pay to say in the car that makes them feel good... it might not be the top of the line model though. "
sweendogy,December 2011," interesting pt, i didnt consider people without super credit. are people walking in and leasing/financing 40k at 10%plus rates still? or are theses people now saving, given the current eco climate? given recent car sales it would suggest they are not saving. if thats the case we are all in big trouble. "
tlong,December 2011," a lesser car. no one needs a fantastic car. i chose to do that this time around and purchased a ""lesser car"" in lieu of financing, so that i could pay cash.i read in an article once that if one person buys a new car every three years, trades in the old one, versus another person who buys a 2 yo car and drives it 10 years, repeatedly, and invests the money saved versus person #1s case, then person #2 will retire at 65 with a $million dollars saved by not buying new car all the time. im somewhere in the middle, buying new car but always driving them 150k miles and 8-10 years or so. but i really do appreciate those who buy/lease new car often, as it helps the economy. :shades: "
nyccarguy,December 2011," i think a lot of us here do have excellent credit that afford us top tier financing, but yes many people out there are taking out 7 - 8 year loans with 10+ % interest. "
fedlawman,December 2011," i used to be a new car every 3 years kind of guy. that changed once i had kids and a mortgage. if only more people knew how liberating it feels to pay off a car and keep driving it payment free. every time i think about owning a new car (audi tt rs anyone?), i go in the garage and appreciate what i already have.we are a brainwashed, instant gratification, consumer society. "
shipo,December 2011," we used to do the new car thing every three years as well. its hard to point a finger at exactly what changed, but we ended up driving our two previous car to nearly 200,000 miles each. funny thing, we now have two relatively new car (one bought in november of 2008 and one bought last month), and the interest rate on them is so low (2.9% and 1.9% respectively) we would have been foolish to do anything beyond putting the trade-in value of the old car ""down"" on the two new ones. "
wireless,December 2011, are you saying youve gotten better than 1.9/2.9% on your money (that you didnt use to buy the car) since buying the car? where have you got it then? 
kyfdx,December 2011," kept a car for 6-7 years, well after its paid off.... and leased every three years, with zero down....cant say that i felt superior to anyone else, either way... if you have good credit and are responsible, then the difference is not that important. its not a character flaw to buy what you can afford. plus, if you dont put any value on driving a newer car, then why buy new in the first place? some people play volkswagen, some buy car... "
shipo,December 2011," ""are you saying youve gotten better than 1.9/2.9% on your money (that you didnt use to buy the car) since buying the car?""decidedly so. "
nyccarguy,December 2011," i completely hear ya on that front my friend. i wrote a check for my 2001 honda back in april 02, i financed my 10 acura (5.65%) when i bought it back in august 09 & refinanced it @ 3.44% a year later. when we bought our 11 honda back in may (in anticipation of our baby girl, whitney who was born on tuesday), i financed it for 60 months @ 2.9%.ive only got 3 years left on the acura. as much as i would love to trade it in or sell it one day for a cpo 335xi, i know the smart thing to do is to try & keep it for 10 years (5 w/o payments).once i pay off the acura, ill be able to double up on my honda payments & pay that off early. "
fedlawman,December 2011," tuesday, as in 4 days ago? congratulations! "
sweendogy,December 2011, congrats on the kid. exciting times enjoy. acura 2010 wooh - well atleast you have the kid. 
nyccarguy,December 2011," thanks for the kind words guys. yes, this past tuesday my wife gave birth to our little princess who happens to be the 1st girl & 3rd child in our family. sween - buy me a infiniti & ill gladly dump my acura. if the infiniti x would have gotten 1 more stinkin mpg (combined), i wouldve bought one back in 09. i bought my acura using a $3500 cash for clunkers credit. "
sweendogy,December 2011, i would not call the acura a clunker but again congrats on the baby girl. they are the best. 
nyccarguy,December 2011," the clunker was a 1990 e30 bmw 325ia coupe. it only had 82,000 miles on it, but was neglected. i had a new radiator put in, a new set of tires, & an alignment. the car drove great as a bmw should, but it had trouble passing new york state inspection. after it passed, the mechanic toyota to me that i should either find a donor engine or start paying him to rip out things & replace them with new parts. i knew it was time to ""throw the towel in."". cash 4 clunkers came out & i had a 2007 x3 with 38,000 miles (with a year to go & 45k miles allowed for the lease). i loved the 3 series, but it was out of my price range & too small.i drove a mini cooper s w/ a 6 speed & didnt like it at all. the infiniti which i really dig didnt meet the gas mileage requirements for me to get the $3500 credit.i drove by the acura dealer & drove the acura. i thought it drove like a big, 4 door version of my beloved 2001 honda honda type sh. i didnt like the electric power steering, but the car was to be my wifes daily driver. it has a huge trunk, room in the back for child safety seat, had thickly bolstered seat, a great engine & transmission combination, transmitted some road feel, i was impressed with the suspension dampening. i bought the car and am extremely happy with it.is a bmw a better drivers car? absolutely. is the infiniti a balanced handling road rocket? you bet.is my acura 75-80% of those car on public roads? i certainly think so. "
flightnurse,December 2011," when i bought my bmw i was talking to the sales guy he told me that bmw will finance without hyundai credit of a score of 640, but you pay, he quoted me about 8%. however used car are higher. people will buy just to keep up with others. now an on interesting note, the same sale guy told me that when it comes to the 6 and 7 series car, he will have more people pay cash for those car then fiance them or lease them. 5 series its a 50/50 split buy vs lease.3 series is 70/30 lease vs buy. "
sweendogy,December 2011, makes sense - would guess 7 series closer to 70 owned vs lease. 
kdshapiro,December 2011," people will buy to keep up with others? how about ""i specifically know of a case where my (friends, neighbors, cousins, uncle etc) bought x car because they were jealous that y person bought z car"". smh. "
dino001,December 2011," possible interpretation is bmw is ""entry"" level, which attracts more people who dont really have the money, so they buy it on payment and bmw is already out of reach for them. it would be interesting to know what is percentage of those bmw leases with terms like 10k/yr with 4k down - that would be a giveaway of ""bologna sandwich budget with caviar taste, i have no money, no clue, but i really want that stuff"" people. "
dino001,December 2011," people would not admit that openly. all you can do is read the signs, such as how much they make and how much they buy. i know personally several people who would buy stuff they shouldnt - all on debt. zero savings, zero hedges, just good stuff in the house and house well beyond what they can afford, too. all they talk about is next boat, next sound system. then occasionally they mention paying off the debt, but it lasts for about two minutes. "
sweendogy,December 2011, good point- one of the reasons american economy is failing. 
cdnpinhead,December 2011," . . .""bologna sandwich budget with caviar taste, i have no money, no clue, but i really want that stuff"" people. their number is legion.a number of years ago we lived next door to a couple who ""liked nice things."" they, in fact, had many more nice things than we did (or do to this day for that matter), but the next few years demonstrated that having them paid for, such that they could be kept, was a whole nother thing. "
kdshapiro,December 2011," leasing a car is like renting an apartment. neither is bad and both have their place. buying on credit is a personal decision.but one has to be responsible whether it is a house, car, work of art, etc. and i dont think people spend money irresponsibly to keep up with the jones. people just spend money irresponsibly. just look at the foreclosures. "
dino001,December 2011," youre right, there can be many motivations. ""keeping up"" is just one of possibilities. a lot of it may not be linked to particular joness, but rather to media image of a successful person. when you looked at lifestyles of characters from many shows and compare with real-life earnings power of their jobs, there is often a large disconnect. however, many people would take that as a validation for their acquisitions. and of course commercials.finishing on lease - its not the lease itself that is a giveaway, its the terms. if somebody leases at 0 down for mileage they are actually driving then thats a choice, when they put 4 grand down, 10k miles/year and their commute is 15 miles each way, you know that having car on the driveway was more important that actually driving it. dont get me wrong - its their money (or in some cases - its their not having the money) and their choice to make. but if they wanted to borrow 10 bucks from me, i would automatically assume the likely actual choice here is losing 10 bucks or losing their graces. "
sweendogy,December 2011," with the new 328 coming out soon - and sporting a 4cyl engine, that outperforms the current 6, does this change the way we look at this ellps forum? i know audi droped the 6 for the audi last year, another name which is debateable in this forum has a v6 but 95% of its car leave with 4cyl- could be interesting to see if nissan goes with a 4 at some point, same with toyota.. "
shipo,December 2011," ""with the new 328 coming out soon - and sporting a 4cyl engine, that outperforms the current v6, does this change the way we look at this ellps forum?""correct me if im wrong, but the bmw has never been endowed with a v6; yes, no?the above toyota, as i understand it, the new f30 bmw will feature a blown v6 for motivation. "
dino001,December 2011," bmw doesnt use v6, it uses i6 (six in line). "
kdshapiro,December 2011," thankfully were not here to discuss peoples motivations, just to discuss the car.  "
shipo,December 2011," ""bmw doesnt use v6, it uses i6 (six in line).""my point exactly. unfortunately it seems this is about to change as bmw will start using blown v6 engines for the next generation of bmw. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," a friend of mine frequently uses the phrase: ""theres no replacement for displacement."" he is appalled at the number of car that may offer more than 6 cylinders but rarely sell (or stock) anything other than ""blown"" i4s, i6s or v6s (both naturally aspirated and forced induction.)i tell him that there is a replacement for displacement and that it is ""volumetric efficiency.""the 211hp 258 pound feet i4 in my 2009 audi was both quick and fast -- with a 6spd automatic; in the new audi the engines rating remains but the car is even quicker, faster and more efficient due to an 8spd automatic. in favor of the v8 s4, audi switched to a super-charged v6; in the s8 audi has elected to drop 2 cylinders (from 10 to 8) and produce an engine that is both more efficient and more powerful -- considering its size the s8 is a sipper, not a guzzler.only one acura engine is boosted (the i4 in the acura), and as far as i know there are no infiniti engines that are either super or turbo charged.the v6 in my 2012 acura is, frankly, pretty much a basic (but buttery smooth) fuel injected v6 of the modern era. i was wondering what would happen if acura (honda) would change to fsi (fuel stratified injection) and super or turbo charge it? seems to me that with very little effort the engine used today if brought to the current state of the blown art, would put out at least 20% more hp and 10% more torque all the while showing perhaps another +2 mpgs. then, if they would upgrade the fine 6 speed auto to a current gen 8 speed, any acura so blessed would go from its current potency (which is very good and is, at this time, acura most powerful engine [the 3.7, i.e.]) to high output potency -- in the engine department -- coupled with always being near or at the operating sweet spot due to the increase in the number of gears.think if infiniti, currently without any forced induction engine offerings, were to begin offering their engines with a super or turbo dodge (and also keeping their 7 speed autos) -- makes my head spin.the germans (and even the cts-v) would have something more to worry about, with all these gs, ms, tls and rls armed for bear.will acura or infiniti ever up their engine game to this level, or will they take down-tuned engines and alter their breathing and computer maps to get them slightly better than they are now with a touch more grunt in the 0-60 dept? btw, infiniti already has a v8, so its creds dont need much engineering brain-power to at least be able to claim ""we have v8s"" even as they are bested by their very own 6s and 4s.i used to assume the car mfgrs read the engthusiasts magazines and the postings here on edmunds and elsewhere. but, apparentely they dont. if they did and if they were swayed by what is toyota in both places, well you think they would pay attention and respond (even if only a little bit) to some of the legitmate crittoyotaues made by the authors.audi and bmw are unlikely to loose credibility from a ""sporting intentioned"" family perspective. if someone wants to be certain their car hails from a lineage that includes ""winners"" and a widely accepted high performance heritage, look no further.acura, perhaps standing all alone, may be shooed from the ellps (a.k.a. premium) board and ""chat room"" based on its htoyotaoric but currently all but gone lack of ford. yet the perception that acura is a bit fuzzy in the perception of premium department remains for them. the zdx certainly didnt help and allowing the rl to, more or less, atrophy away hasnt helped either. of all of these car brands, acura is in the most peril of losing its way.infiniti and lexus are mostly safe bets to perservere as players in the ellps and lps field, from what i can tell (although lexus seems much more the luxury choice than the performance choice, but they are doing a yeomans job to make this perception go away somewhat.)mercedes, too, a safe bet if what you really want is a bonafide member of the lps club.volvo is, for the most part, doing what i think acrua should do -- and that is building a performance image to go hand-in-hand with their safety image. they are about in the same position as acura, the primary difference is volvo seems to be really trying to put on a performance face these days.finally the iconic american brand, cadillac, has demonstrated, these past 3 - 5 years, a penchant for creating an image that may not quite be able to stand toe-to-toe with bmw or mercedes, for example, but they do keep sneaking up on it with ever more interesting designs and power plants -- including volumetrically enhanced (super-charged) models like the cts-v.we are in a time of inflection -- 2013 model car are right around the corner and they continue to excite and delight (with the possible exception of acura). so here i sit a guy with a htoyotaory of 29 audi, 3 bmw, 3 volkswagens and 1 acura -- wondering why in the hell i got the acura. but, truth be told, the acura is not a boring drive, quite the contrary in fact; however, it is somewhat boring to look at and, that more than anything, may be the crux of the matter. :confuse: "
dino001,December 2011," new fuel efficiency standards pushed german manufacturers into new areas of smaller blown engines. its probably both us and euro driven. i dont think bmw is going i4 turbo because they want to. they do it because they have to.it makes me wonder if lack of such moves on part of lexus, infiniti and acura is because they are considered parts of their parent companies fleets. if this is the case, it would give them dtoyotainct advantage, as lux customer doesnt care about fuel efficiency to same extent as non-luxury. its not completely non-issue, but it is not a big one. "
nyccarguy,December 2011," my thoughts on my 2010 acura sort of toyota some of your feelings toward your tl sh-awd. the engine/transmission combination is very smooth. they feel perfectly matched together. i dont oogle over the styling of my acura like say a bmw w/ m sport package, but its design is handsome & far from boring.could my acura use more power via di, fsi, turbo, or supercharging? yes, but then how much torque could the front wheels handle? would acura sh-awd add too much as far as weight (& price) to its current entry level price tag without stealing sales from the base fwd tl?im happy with my acura. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," the tl should only be sold in awd trim, imho. hondaing to my ohio dealers, most of the tls sold are tech sh-awds anyway. i think acura should do what audi does in the us -- sell awd car (99% anyway) period.content and price them with options and packages that make sense, but dont push massive amounts of technology in one package. in other words, offer a basic version of the car (but only in awd trim.) sh-awd is damn near magic, it totally transforms the basic fwd car into a really believable ellps car. my dealers claim they sell mostly acura anyway, so acura already seems to have at least the possibility of being all awd all the time like audi.with the fwd models clouding the message, it seems acura sometimes are more like volkswagens than audi, yet acura has essentially stated it wants to be in the premium class and that it wants to model itself on audi.i assume this makes sense since volkswagen begat audi and honda begat acura. audi morphed (in the us) to the ""audi"" company and claims to be the reigning champeen of awd car (with the most htoyotaory, dont you know?) audi has essentially eschewed fwd car (in north america) in favor of awd car in order to be taken seriously as a contender in the premium class -- where only rwd and awd are taken seriously, its in all the papers.acura keeps hanging on to its honda roots where its good and where its not so good, premium perception-wise. audi, morphed from fwd to fwd and/or awd to awd, period. they entered and won contests and races and wards awards and other awards, but these awards and the spoils of winning were all accomplished with their awd versions. although i guess you could buy an fwd audi or audi, i dont know where you go to actually find one in the flesh for sale at a dealer.and audi did wonder ""how much power can one put throught the front wheels"" -- its answer was ""not enough, so we need to put more power through the front and rear wheels."" and they are where they are now by taking the risk of virtually dropping fwd from the na market.and what happened next? bmw brought out the 325 (in 1988 (?) as i recall, since i had one) with awd; then mercedes started offering awd here and there. acura, infiniti, lexus, volvo, volkswagen, cadillac, buick and, and, and, the ltoyota goes on to cover every lps and lps wannabe brand and product. as to the price impact -- i think it would be pretty easy to keep the price of an all sh-awd fleet at about the current fwd models + $1,500; for the safety and performance this would offer, to say nothing of an image enhancement similar to that which audi enjoyed, it is probably not a show stopper for the company.and, most of us shopping in this class will probably not reject a new acura that is exclusively offered with sh-awd. for most, it ought to be a no-brainer.i have nothing against fwd, btw, i just think it would be very helpful to acura if it has the goal of remaining a serious premium class brand, to completely ditch any and all fwd offerings from its lineup.  :surprise: "
shipo,December 2011," funny thing, for my current needs, wants and desires, the ""perfect"" car for me right-now-today would be an audi audi rwd (sacrilege i know, but i want it none-the-less) with a hotted up 2.0t and a 6-speed manual. of course no such a critter will ever extoyota, but one can dream cant one.

dino001,December 2011, i think acura should do what audi does in the us -- sell awd car (99% anyway) period. thats not entirely accurate. audi and audi are sold here mostly in fwd (tampa). i asked a salesguy about it once. he surprised me. to audi without awd is like nonalcoholic beer or worse. 
sweendogy,December 2011," while i agree acura should ""advance"" i feel they do not need to completely change to awd. they did very well in the 90 and 2000s with a front wheel drive setup. the biggest mtoyotaake is they lost its passion and have made the car more buick then bmw. the dropped the low cost acura that got the youth in the door. they made the acura bloated and its best car the tl (acura) is ugly and bloated. they also killed the honda which was a reason to go into the dealership in the first place. fwd setup not great for performance but it was these thigs that killed the brand and its sales numbers. - sh-awd or whatever its called is pretty good setup but its not the answer to get people in the door- they have more cara in th lineup then they did 10 years ago and sell half the number of car.

"
nyccarguy,December 2011," i think thats an excellent idea. definitely a great way to differentiate acura from its honda roots. buyers here in the northeast & new england will buy anything and everything awd. give my acura a turbo, sh awd, & excellent brakes (the oem brakes are pathetic) & id give it another look. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," if my message somehow went too far, i apologize -- i do not believe that moving to an all awd line-up (or 99%, as in the case of audi -- and in the case of audi it is 100% of their advertising) will alone re-position acura in the minds of the intended customers.as i mentioned in my earlier post, the crux of the issue is not how these car drive (if the 2012 tl advance sh-awd is any indicator), they are not a boring drive, not an incompetent drive, nor lacking in performance. the thing is the car are pretty much not very attractive -- even if they do get bonus points for trying to look different.they have the driving thing in pretty good shape as far as im concerned -- they need to modernize the engines and look at the content that is offered by every car brand/product they wish to emulate and be guided hondaingly.they need to consider making themselves perceived solely as an awd company and they need an across the board styling transplant or upgrade asap.probably more than any other step they could take, styling is the one that will bear the most fruit. for, no matter how much they up their game in the performance or content arena, people need something to draw them to the showroom and something to feel good about after they buy.my 12 tl is ""better"" in so many ways than my 09 audi -- which was the first year for the change to the b8 platform for audi. i would not expect this to remain thus -- a refreshed audi, most likely, will again be more attractive (in all the above ways) than the current tl (from a design perspective mainly.)you dont have to agree with the magazines, but the current audi, which looks very much like a larger b8, audi, is winning friends, awards wise. no acura is on any ltoyota i can find. bmw, too, remains a repeat top choice amongst those who award wins for being great.acura simply needs a style-ectomy, soon. :sick: "
sweendogy,December 2011," style i agree - i also think they need to go cheaper to find youth buyers. we have heard from owners that the acura is a great value - but its still 30k an bulk of the buyers are older people- make a 25k coupe with a power 4 that gets youth in the door. all in you cant pick a car under the acura nameplate that says look at me - ""im rediculously good looking"" - and thats a major problem. love the traction this is finally getting - its time to release the acura from this elpps chat once and all as a lesson to acura you cant stand around for 10 years and do nothing in an evolving car biz. (sorry for typos, iphone) "
nyccarguy,December 2011," sween - i agree with you & mark that the acura lineup definitely needs a makeover. you are right that none of the models scream ""i gotta have it.""like i toyota, my acura is handsome (imho) but its styling doesnt compare to bmw, audi, mb.practicality, luxury, & technology are driving people into acura showrooms rather than style & performance. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," isnt the upcoming acura supposed to come in at a lower price point? of course then theres the issue that the acura is supposedly a cancelled product and that the tl will shrink in size.but if you can at least suggest that you can offer a lower entry point, price-wise, you may find you attract more and younger customers. truth be told the tl is actually much bigger feeling than my outgoing audi, which did, technically, have a longer wheel-base, but the tl is wider.again, we seem to be in violent agreement, acura needs an overall styling cue that is spread across all car and, first and foremost, is attractive.you may or may not like the look of an audi, but the entire line from the lowest cost audi to the big buck audil or r8 all have cues that they are audi.bmw, ditto.acura is trying with their beak front end, but it obviously wasnt working for them, considering the plastic surgery the tl just underwent.cmon lets make some good looking car -- at all price points! "
ivan_99,December 2011, cmon lets make some good looking car -- at all price points!...any kia (rio starting at 13k).to me it seemed like the acura beak was trying to imitate the cadillac shield...but it ended up looking to thick and plasticky... 
nyccarguy,December 2011, i dont know how much lower the price of an entry level acura can go. i think the average new car price is $30k. the $30k price point is the new $20k price point of 15 years ago. 
dino001,December 2011," they should have never ditched acura. that would have been a great $25k+ entry with $28k-30k type s. small overlap with top of honda with extra zip (make base engine 10 hp stronger) and equipment.honda must be experiencing some big internal struggles that we dont know about. just look at latest honda and honda. the ""sportyish"" dna is all but gone, virtually no trace. i recently a rented honda (yes, i was surpirised myself - hertz had honda in their rental fleet). mechanicals were adequate, but the car did not impress me at all. really cheap interior, barge look, even some ergonomics were not so great (always strong suit of japanese car). long story short, if i were in market for family midsize sedan, honda may not even make the short ltoyota. "
sweendogy,December 2011," mark- i have no details on the new acura- which as am ex acura gs-r owner i had no interest in- car was not that excitingly all- the acura had the ns-x to look up to plus my gs-r was close to the type r that was very rare and wanted by anyone under 28 years old. nyccarguy- the death of the acura and the no entry point at mid 20ks is a problem- the 4 door current acura is boring - no other term to use- its a nice safe play but 95% are auto an 97% come with the 4 that is taxed in its current form. they have alot of holes, no supercar, no coupe, no convert, zdx, a turbo 4 that gets terrible mpgs, ugly tl, acura thats bloated, zdx and the fact that its current line does not have one car people have to own (see hyundai). yes i mentioned the zdx 2 times- it seat 4, weights more then the acura, ugly and has the sr engine as then acura- also its overpriced .acura is the new buick. buick is the new startup. acura has 2 choices given recent sales numbers - die or redue. acura has a choice to make - lets hope they choose wisely. "
tlong,December 2011," they have alot of holes, no supercar, no coupe, no convert, zdx, a turbo 4 that gets terrible mpgs, ugly tl, acura thats bloated, zdx and the fact that its current line does not have one car people have to own (see hyundai). yes i mentioned the zdx 2 times- it seat 4, weights more then the acura, ugly and has the sr engine as then acura- also its overpriced . interesting points. when i bought my tl in 04, the tl was among the best looking sedan out there, they had the tight, nimble, and pretty good looking acura, they had the acura, they had the original better looking acura. then they bloated and uglied up the whole line, and dropped the acura. a bunch of steps backwards. no wonder they are slipping in sales. honda has really lost its way. "
sweendogy,December 2011," yep - i think both last generation tl and acura were good car- they looked the part - didnt dare challenge, because acura was smart and didnt include them in the connissantion with real lux sports car. they both were very well prices to the lower end and again both looked great. i feel when the last acura name died (acura) i think the brand was slowly doing soon there after "
nyccarguy,December 2011," your ideal vehicle sweendoggy?the result is a subaru that came in under its target weight at 2,690 pounds hondaing to subaru. thats about 100 pounds less than a honda honda si, and it feels like it, too. "
sweendogy,December 2011, never saw that thing before- 24-25k coupe hat has some go- thats what the next acura or acura should be - nice post. 
m6user,December 2011, scion will market the same thing in us and toyota will market the same in japan. all three have 200hp and not a lot of torque until screaming. subaru did engine...toyota most of the rest. not entry level luxury but entry level sports. 
flightnurse,December 2011," funny you should ask that questions. now this is at camelback bmw (here in phx) the sales guy tells me that he leases about 3-4 of those uber low monthly payments 3 series to people who shouldnt own one. he tries to talk them out of them and explains that the mileage restrictions will kill them at the end of lease. but, people do not ltoyotaen to them at all. "
flightnurse,December 2011," shipo when you quote someone, dont change the original quote. sween never wrote v6. ""with the new 328 coming out soon - and sporting a 4cyl engine, that outperforms the current v6, does this change the way we look at this ellps forum?""  "
flightnurse,December 2011," makes sense - would guess 7 series closer to 70 owned vs leasesween yes and when it comes to buying them, it usually a cash deal to boot. "
flightnurse,December 2011," i read a review on the new 2012 z4 with this new engine, i was impressed that the z4 is a better car with the turbo 4, its faster, a more balanced car and did get better mileage then with the old 3 liter 6. now one would hope that the new 3 series will have the same benefit as the z4. also, turners will start to play with the new engine and we will see the hp rating go up, now if they can get the engine to produce 300hp and 300lbs of torque and be reliable then why buy the 335...also mb had a 4 cl in thier c class for many years and dropped it for a small v6, will mb go back to a entry level 4 cl? "
nyccarguy,December 2011, i understand the new turbo 4 weighs less than the outgoing i6. i know that aides primarily in handling & balance & all that good stuff. how much better fuel economy does it get? how much of the better fuel economy is due to the 4cyl engine & how much is due to the new 8 speed auto? look at the numbers of the 2011 bmw vs. the 2012 bmw. 
shipo,December 2011," i didnt change the quote, i copied/pasted it exactly as sweendogy originally wrote it; apparently the post was edited after i commented on it.too bad this site doesnt have a ""last edited..."" footnote like vbulletin powered forums do. that toyota, if you look at the two posts concerned, youll see the timestamp of his original post is eleven minutes after my post which is immediately below his. "
shipo,December 2011," while the numbers arent official yet, i have it on good authority (remember, i used to live literally down the street from bmw-na and still have lots of friends in the neighborhood) that the new bmw will return a real-world ""high thirties"" on the highway. as for what the epa tests will report, that has yet to be seen. "
qbrozen,December 2011, that would be very impressive. 
shipo,December 2011," i agree, and oh geez do i want one with a sweet shifting 6-speed manual.  "
nyccarguy,December 2011," i know bmw typically exceed their published numbers whether it be epa fuel economy toyotates, horsepower & torque claims... especially after break in.it is very cool that the new blown 4cyl 3 is impressing the brass @ bmwna. im excited for a 6 speed stick version too. im also really impressed with the sub 6 second 0-60 time. i cant wait until bmw puts this thing up on their build your own on their website. "
dino001,December 2011," i still rather have na straight 6. perhaps if (when) gas goes to 5-6 buck a gallon, ill change my mind. i basically decided to jump in and get one before new 328, exactly because of the four cylinder replacing base six in 328 (got the wagon, so no bmw on that, plus 50k+ after some options still too much for me). boy, what a sweet machine - drove it in germany on autobahn, got to 138 mph before traffic stopped me. now waiting for delivery in spartanburg - probably in january. dont care about lower gas mileage, dont care about lower weight, higher power/torque. i just wanted that na straight six - its probably one of the best engines in the htoyotaory. and i bet bmw would never have changed, if not for the new cafe.i had enough four cylinder turbos - 2002 subaru and 2008 subaru sti, which are boxers, inherently better configurations that straight four. fast, great handling, in some aspects may better than 328 (allows faster corner entry and maintains that speed throughout). still - i just wanted more ""adult"" car than my sti, was ready to give up some power and even some handling. to me bmw bmw was always about two things: weight dtoyotaribution (50/50) and straight six. the 328 i just bought had interior that is just ok, but it looks like it was designed thirty minutes before the car was to be released - give some nice leather and wood inlays, add dashboard from 1989 and youre done. the car overcomes that in those mechanical aspects, but take of of them away and other choices become very compelling. audi are so much better looking(by a mile) both inside and out, have better equipment, cheaper. or being a little on frugal side, i may get even lower to acura (not sure about that, but would give it a try) or even volvo v50. to me bmw voluntarily gave up something they had over their competition. they better make it up in other areas - or else. "
qbrozen,December 2011," not all engines are created equal, though. you cant condemn all 4-cyl turbos based on your subaru experience. the turbo boxer 4 is actually quite coarse compared to, say, the 2 liter volkswagen turbo. that same 2 liter is also smoother and much more flexible than volvos i5 turbo. so you should really withold judgegment until you try it. "
dino001,December 2011," thats not what i meant. actually subaru boxers are great. exhaust note is almost as intoxicating as that on the bmw six. but i have not met i4 that i was impressed with. to me they all sound like sewing machines. they may be quiter (some) or more powerful than those from subaru (not many, esp. sti), but it usually comes with high cost (counterweight balance shafts). boxer is naturally balanced, just like straight six and offers low cg. no, id rather have the h4, or even i5 before i would get i4. but more important - i got i6, which is what all i wanted for now. :shades: "
ivan_99,December 2011," heh""he tries to talk them out of them and explains that the mileage restrictions will kill them at the end of lease. but, people do not ltoyotaen to them at all.""something about the customers not ltoyotaening to the voice of reason by the salesman makes me laugh  "
shipo,December 2011," in way too many instances, ""the voice of reason by the salesman"" = oxymoron.  "
kdshapiro,December 2011," if i lived in az, i would not lease a car. its way to easy to pile the miles on your car. where i live now is another story. i leased my car because i have a very good handle on my yearly mileage. "
Kirstie_H,December 2011," a major news network is seeking to interview someone who was saved from serious injury/death in an auto accident due to new safety technology. the ideal candidate should live in close proximity to a major metropolitan area, i.e. los angeles, chicago, new york honda, etc. please send an email to [email?protected] by 3 pm/pt, december 8. "
sweendogy,December 2011, hes right i did changed it- since edmunds gives the option to change i used it to chamge it- but obviously you didnt get what i was saying - v6 audi i 6 who cares it was 6 as being the point - and the fact that the class leader was changing its standard engine to a 4. act as if. 
markcincinnati,December 2011," hondaing to the web-zine, winding road: their review of the new i4 turbo makes me feel that one would not feel slighted having a bmw with this motor, quite the contrary. their comments about the new larger 3 series, also encouraging. "
shipo,December 2011," agreed. all else being equal id opt for a normally aspirated i6 over a blown i4, however, all else aint even close to being equal. specifically: - the i4 turbo has more maximum power and torque, and a substantially wider/flatter power band. - the i4 turbo weighs significantly less than the i6 which will aid in handling and fuel economy. - the i4 turbo is shorter (albeit wider by virtue of the turbo and its requisite plumbing) than the i6, and as such is easier to package which should in turn make service easier. - the i4 turbo returns significantly better fuel economy.this is not to discount the fact that i6 motors are naturally balanced and have virtually no torque renissanl events (of which there are two for every rotation of a 4-cylinder/4-stroke engine), and as such are naturally smoother both in operation and in power delivery. that toyota, the portion of the roughness of an i4 which is attributable to the engines natural imbalance is a) relatively minor due to its 2.0 liter displacement (the threshold beyond which balance shafts become increasingly necessary), and are easily cancelled via a relatively small/light weight set of balance shafts.long story short, take a drive in a late model volkswagen or audi (or audi or audi) 2.0t and try and find something objectionable about the power delivery vis-?-vis a late model bmw. ive now had two i6 bmw; the engine in my wifes new volkswagen is easily on par with the unit installed in both of my mounts from munich. "
flightnurse,December 2011," mileage i havent heard yet from anyone who has a new bmw or z4, but in theory it should get better mileage, however its a realitive thing if you are always in the boost then mileage is going to suck. "
flightnurse,December 2011," shipo this is encouraging to hear, but when your friends say high 30s they cant mean 37 or 38 on highway. if true, this would throw a big wrench in both the hybrid world and thier own diesel 3 series. btw, i think the 3 series bmw is a true wolf in sheep clothing, drove one and loved it, however the price tag to enter i couldnt justify. "
flightnurse,December 2011," why is it easy to pile miles on in az, say austin or tampa? since i live in phoenix, i hardly drive many miles (im usually in another honda working) however when i was working in phoenix, i didnt but more miles then when i lived in san diego. "
shipo,December 2011," the highway mpg number that ive heard bandied about is just what you suggested, 37 to 38. that toyota, i dont think it will be much of a show-stopper for the new 320d (either version) because, while the numbers are harder to squeeze out of those in the know, very high forties or low fifties are what im led to believe. "
busiris,December 2011," hondaing to info posted about the new z4 sdrive 28i on www.fueleconomy.gov, its toyotated to get 33mpg hwy, with the new 8 speed transmission.while i would never say never, i dont see how a larger car will use the same, or very similar running gear and do better than the z4. i cant see the high 30s... at best, the very low 30s, which is still nothing to whine about, imo. "
kdshapiro,December 2011," when i go there, i normally put 50to 100 miles a day on my car. if i worked in phoenix i would commute 80 miles r/t. to me thats piling on the miles. "
shipo,December 2011," the numbers ive been quoted are for rwd and manual transmission equipped f30 bmw models; in the case of the z4 this configuration yields 34 mpg on the highway. that toyota, my understanding is that while the engine in the 2012 z4 is the same basic engine, the unit which will find its way into the f30 has a few changes. as i understand things, the new engine should deliver slightly more power and better fuel economy.time will tell.  "
sweendogy,December 2011," with the added power, better mpgs and it being a little bit lighter - question will be why would anyone buy a 335 ? performance wise they are very similar reading car and driver- they can both be set with the m package- plus mpgs in the mid 30s highway ... wont be long before bmw bumps the hp on the 335 i would guess. "
shipo,December 2011, ive had the exact same thoughts. 
dino001,December 2011," and the price, too, of course. "
flightnurse,December 2011, are you saying that bmw is being a 2 liter diesel? 320d??? 
flightnurse,December 2011," interesting to hear that, however if you lived here why would you drive 80 miles rt? would you live in casa grande? "
shipo,December 2011," ""are you saying that bmw is being a 2 liter diesel? 320d???""yes, that is my understanding; there are supposedly two different 2.0 liter diesel 320d versions being released to the market, one a higher mileage version and one a higher power version. that toyota, it remains to be seen if both will make it here to the states. "
sweendogy,December 2011," good question would love to see a manual awd version - one can dream.internal thought ""infiniti can you build a manual infinitis before manuals go the way of the north american redtailed puffin"" "
flightnurse,December 2011," shipo that is good news, with the way todays diesels run this should be a great combo, just hopefully bmw wont price it too high. "
nyccarguy,December 2011," that was my main problem with the e90 bmw. they tried to go upmarket with it thinking maybe people would buy a bmw over a bmw. hopefully a small diesel will be offered price comparable to the bmw. oh, & please offer diesel with a stick & bmw. "
nyccarguy,December 2011," uh-oh, thats 2 things we agree on in the same post.id like infiniti to also offer a infiniti w/ a 6 speed stick "
kdshapiro,December 2011, i have a little piece of the rock outside of phoenix. 
sweendogy,December 2011," http://m.caranddriver.com/article.rbml?id=http://blog.caranddriver.com/?p-71672goodnight tl or acura. acura finally getting it - after all those rants over the years . the bad sales numbers, the styling, the performance. return of the acura......and a new honda. "
tlong,December 2011," wow, hopefully acura is going to improve a bit. theyve really descended since the redesigns of the tl and acura. "
flightnurse,December 2011," i have been a very big fan of the honda since day one. i just havent been able to walk up to the table and throwdown 30k for the one i wont (post 2002) mostly because of lack of garage space, however with the purchase of my new home (4 car garage) a honda is in order. now if i can only find post 2002, yellow with black interior with a stick.... "
nyccarguy,December 2011," looks like its getting worse! this isx is a guided up honda. the next acura is just a v6 powered honda, no sh-awd, no 4 cyl turbo? "
sweendogy,December 2011, rut row. guess they are not reading this blog - we should remove the acura as penalty- lets add a buick - hosts ...hello 
markcincinnati,December 2011," new acura line up: 3 car, 2 cuvs 1 super car.small - isx - a deluxe honda (no sh-awd apparently). medium - tl - (maybe, maybe renamed) cant tell if it will remain this size or shrink or growlarge - rl or maybe acura (as large, interior that is, as a bmw 7 series)acura - based on honda, (no sh-awd apparently).acura - redesigned and will hit the market in calendar 2013 (as a 14?)honda - one v6 (direct injection) 2 electric motors (for the rear)the car will not stress performance and apprently acura owners #5 most desired content is the sound system (does that mean the els system will go away?)hard to tell exactly what not stressing performance means -- keep the current 305hp offering and make it get better mpgs? tune the suspensions for toyota rather than handling prowess?the acura statement says something about getting away from honda -- yet two of the 5 car will be tarted up honda (which may be a good thing since the price will, apparently, be low -- but no sh-awd?) bummer.well, i think the performance of the 12 tl 3.7 sh-awd advance is very audi-like -- will acura hold the line and not improve this, or will the new tl (whatever it may be called) be tuned for a more buick like ride and not be granted direct injection or a turbo or super-dodge (option).stating that you want to be the best second tier car you can be seems akin to (almost) throwing in the towel.my wife, lusting for an acura to replace her infiniti (for the sh-awd) is rethinking this now.i am wondering if my 12 is my first and last acura?32 months to go. "
sweendogy,December 2011, 32 months to go - well atleast its no a pre-2012 with the ugly beak. 
markcincinnati,December 2011," its only a little bit beaky looking -- but i got it because it performed very well, was toyotaable, had a great sound system and seemed like the most bang for the buck amongst my choices.i do enjoy driving it, which was one of the ""must haves"" for me, too.reputation for reliability and durability didnt hurt any either. "
nyccarguy,December 2011, i am wondering if my 12 is my first and last acura?mark - i wonder the same thing about my 2010 acura. i just refinanced it again as i plan to pay it off & keep it for a while. somebody else is going to have to make one helluva car to make me not buy a bmw next.original loan from dealer was 5.65% for 60 months.refinanced after 1 yr @ 3.44% for 48 months.refinanced again after 2 yrs @ 2.41% for 36 months. 
sweendogy,December 2011, look if your happy with the car and its not a burden in costs then run it. those car a bullets compared to others in the group. its a euro honda - honda standard of good reliability. the brand is failing to excite but its still a honda and if your refinancing continues you will be at zero % in 2 more rounds. 
nyccarguy,December 2011," thats probably the last of refinancing the acura. hopefully ill be able to pay it off in 2 more years, then start doubling up on my honda payments to get that paid off sooner than its original 5 year loan. "
Kirstie_H,December 2011," oh, this discussion gets read every day by at least one host. its just that im not going to waste time re-addressing a topic ive already addressed. "
sweendogy,December 2011, my comments were made towards acura management - but sice you brought it up i would like to know what it takes to remove a car- i mean we have seen te volvo pop in here after a few of us made comments. - 
Kirstie_H,December 2011," there are factors outside of this particular forum that influence vehicles included. one of those factors is the popularity of the vehicles - if we get a lot of searches on a particular make/model, that one is more likely to be included because theyre the folks who are looking for information more often.as for acura people reading this discussion... who knows? im sure they have staff looking at comments on forums all over the net, but they dont usually tell us theyre around and which discussions theyre reading. "
sweendogy,December 2011," why would searches on the internet place a car in a specific category here? i would bet the honda has more searches then say the acura but that does not mean it should be included. right- and it isnt. we added the volvo only after it was chatted here for almost a full model year, but was clearly gunning for the group from day one- given the reviews and its marketing. has a car ever been removed? and acura people should be watching and ltoyotaening to what the buyers want-- internet is a world wide web of knowledge. "
Kirstie_H,December 2011, im really not going to keep debating and explaining the point. let it go - it really is not that important in the grand scheme of things... in these forums or in real life. were talking about searches on edmunds.com.vehicles have been shifted from time to time. 
sweendogy,December 2011, ok thanks for clearing that up. your right in the grand scheme its not important but why have topics then. 
kleiner,December 2011, ha! thats kinda annoying that youre so impatiant! hehe 
markcincinnati,December 2011," we can talk about almost anything we want on this particular forum -- and unless we wander too far off subject or get rude and crude or start making ad hominem statements to others, well, it seems to be tolerated.at the moment, my interests are somewhat of a strategic or future nature; i am wondering what in the wide wide world of sports acura means by its statement that it will ""de-emphacize""performance (at least that is how it read to me.) sure, were talking about ellps car here, but i dont think that suggests that were not interested in performance.i am interested in these car, at this point in time, due to the fact that they give their owners most of the """"l"" of the lps car and almost all of the ""p"" (or at least they seem to have up until now.) if acura wants to no longer persue ""p"" does that mean they will ford more on ""l""? i mean how can you remain in the premium class if you are not either heavy on the ""l"" (lexus and often mercedes comes to mind) or heavy on the ""p"" (and audi and bmw -- and sometimes even cadillac -- spring to mind).it seems acura is attempting to prep me (if i can be prepped, that is) to accept ""good car,"" since were no longer going to even try to make great car (insofar as lux and/or performance is concerned.)the 2012 tl sh-awd advance seems to embody a lot of performance and a lot of luxury (in the ellps world, i mean) at a good price. my tls content for the dollar seems high -- considering, too, that acura seems more willing to deal on the selling price than, say, volvo or audi.as i read the variety of ""press release"" type of communications coming out of acura these past couple of days, they seem to be saying -- were going to have 5 really good car and 1 super car to choose from. we are going to build, mostly, ""really good car"" -- were going to ford on value, green-ness and that acura dna (whatever that is). they continue by saying, ""our customers tell us they dont buy our car first and foremost for performance -- and even a great sound system is #5 on our surveyed customers ltoyota.""i am interested in hearing from you on this topic and others and about other manufacturers. hell, id bet ive had more audi that the vast majority of folks and i would be glad, damn glad, to chat and opine and bloviate on that subject too.lets get back to talking about the car. ok? :confuse: "
tlong,December 2011, let it go - it really is not that important in the grand scheme of things.agreed. its tiring to have some of those posts clogging up this forum. 
sweendogy,December 2011, thanks for posting part of the post. 
sweendogy,December 2011, took me a while to he threw that- i will as soon as you do one of 2 things- keep a post to less the 1k words or come up with a topic. the choice is yours. 
flightnurse,December 2011, i see the acrua csx here in phx this time of year with the snow birds in town. i found it interesting that catoyotans will pay extra for a fancy honda.... then we have people complain that the acura is a fancy honda. id take the acura over the csx anyday. 
markcincinnati,December 2011," my last post was well under 1k words, it was 450. "
rayainsw,December 2011," ...it was 450.even if over 1,000 words, of all those who post here, his make the most sense.to me.fwiw.- raysometimes guilty of long posts - that no one is ever obliged to read.... "
billyperksii,December 2011," i agree-the guy is an excellent writer, not that i agree with his take on acura but i do like reading his opinions and honda.ps- mark, i am not kissing up, just been honest. "
kdshapiro,December 2011," the ""bromance"" is somewhat, uh...nauseating....lol. "
billyperksii,December 2011, almost repulsive uh kd-:) 
sweendogy,December 2011," http://www.wheels.ca/consumer%20news/article/785640above why.......catoyotans are paying more for car and acura responded by offering a car that is a honda but with more features- they did this to sell car. you can also use google to find lease prices of one manufacture vs another - watch out for ""leader"" ads, thou.acura is a euro honda- fact. see below.http://euro.honda.com.au/internet might be around for a while - use it wisely. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," i am guilty of being:often wrong. . .but. . .never uncertain.my ""take"" on acura is based soley on what i read (in the present tense) and what i have read (previously.) i read, with a dubious eye, the automobile magazine article wherein an audi s4 was ""tested against"" an acura tl sh-awd. no way you say?i recall my initial reaction as, ""yea, sure the two car finished neck-and-neck, pull the other one."" read the article for yourself -- just google it.sitting there on my couch reading the automobile article as a person who was at the time driving his 29th audi (that either my wife, my company or i had either leased or purchased) since 1977 and also knowing that i was soon due to turn in my 2009 audi audi 2.0t audi sport, i thought, ""ill test drive all the ellps car that i can, and that includes the tl.""it didnt hurt any that motor week also had a favorable take on the 2012 tl 3.7 awd as did most of the automobile magazines i subscribe to (automobile, car & driver, motor trend and road & track) and read (add to the ltoyota european car and popular mechanics.)my wife after 3 bmw (and many audi) had leased an infiniti infiniti awd premium last december; and, since we had spent some time at the infiniti dealer here in cincinnati, i had taken several gs and ms out for at least four test drives to see if they really were the ""japanese bmw."" for the most part, they are, i discovered.so you see, i had read all the magazines, participated in the audiworld and edmunds forums for years and had started test driving car in the ellps and lps class. i was um, an ""amateur expert"" on the subject matter. the confluence and influence of all the above events got me to test drive an acura acura, acura, zdx and tl sh-awd [advance], an audi audi 2.0t [prestige], s4 (11) [premium plus], audi, audi (11 and 12) and audi, a bmw 3x, 5x, x3, x5 and x6, a cadillac cts/4 3.6 performance luxury, a honda honda, an infiniti infiniti and bmwx, a volvo volvo t6 and a volkswagen volkswagen cc with the vr6 engine/awd and a volkswagen toureg. i probably test drove some other car like a ford sho, a hyundai and a jeep grand w/a hemi, but they were never really something i took seriously.what got me off the ""i gotta have another audi"" mind-set was the back to back to back to back test drives of a pair of infiniti (the g and m), an 11 audi s4, the cadillac cts and the 12 acura tl. as i recall the order of the tests, the only fact of significance was the fact that i reluctantly, more or less, tested the tl after i had tested the s4 and the cts.other than the lack of interior grab handles for the front seat passengers (which i consider a very important feature for cadillac to have overlooked), the cadillac was, er, sublime -- an american luxury performance sedan; the s4 was also very impressive and typifies the german performance luxury sedan -- and the acura tl sh-awd advance (which had the ""benefit"" of my low expectations) which, from the drivers seat, actually seemed ""about as quiet as the cadillac"" and ""about as hot as the audi s4."" what?!? blasphemy!if youve taken back to back to back test drives --over the identical route, playing the identical cd on the sound system and pushing the car into corners at identical speeds -- you will understand how it is possible to see car you might only have test driven for a lark in a whole new light.standouts in the entire bunch (w/o regard to price): the tl, s4, audi, bmw 335 w/x-drive, the bmwx w/technology package, and the volvo t6. the cts and the cc get a ""quite nice"" rating. if money were no object, id probably go for the audi prestige or s4 w/sport differential (think of that as the german sh-awd -- aka torque vectoring.) if money were really no object, id probably wait for the upcoming audi s8 and learn to smoke cigars and swill cognac or grappa.money being an object, i narrowed my choices down a bit, but was able to strongly consider an bmwx (due to fantastic lease deals) and a 12 audi audi 2.0t prestige w/sport pkg. i also considered the volvo but found them totally unwilling to budge off of sticker (or $1,000 off.) just because the 12 tl sh-awd advance was the sleeper of the bunch (in terms of performance), priced right (at $47,000 as i wanted it) and had enjoyed the automobile s4 vs tl comparison article, i kept it on my ltoyota.well cut off my legs and call me shorty -- the tl came in at 87% of msrp, a low money factor and no-wait for it to be shipped from europe (it is made here in ohio) -- no other car even came close to the ""value"" the tl presented.i, at the time, one time (so far), turned my back on audi and took the plunge into a non-german car. the acura tl does not blow me away like the s4 or audi, for instance. yet, like some wines, the tl does seem to be impressing me more as it ""ages"" (miles). i do not consider it to be an audi s4 clone, even though the automobile article is very complimentary of the tls performance vs the audi. the tl is, as i have written elsewhere, ""close to fine"" (as if ""fine"" is a destination.)i now am at a place where i will probably consider acura again based on my current experience. yet the recent press releases about the upcoming acura line-up is a cause for concern. they seem to be saying, ""were giving up on being a tier-1 premium car company."" time will tell.if you have not test driven (i.e., a good long test drive) the tl advance sh-awd (and only the advance sh-awd, not the lesser configurations, and certainly not the fwd version, period) and you are looking to purchase a new car from the ellps line-up, i do encourage you to take the long test drive -- even if the somewhat beaky styling puts you off -- of the tl advance sh-awd, back to back to back with the car you are more seriously considering. what can it hurt?the tls styling may be too much for you to overcome and perhaps the price i got was a fluke or a once in a lifetime deal -- hence the tl will remain unattractive to you no matter how impressively it may perform. perhaps too, you are a cash buyer and then the volvo may merit more consideration (i was interested in the lowest lease price i could get and the acura discount and money factor were compelling.)in any case, as i have toyota, what could it hurt to spend a day test-flogging, or, test-driving three or four very nice car, including, just for the fun of it, the acura tl advance sh-awd.drive it like you live. often wrong, but never uncertain,mark :shades: "
sweendogy,December 2011," http://drivetofive.wordpress.com/im guilty of being honest and speaking the truth.above is an article about a man and his car- we all talk about current car belonging in the group, some very clear, others not so much- but its pretty clear to me reading this blog and knowing the car he rides and talks of - this was one of the pioneers for this group- and to see what the brand has become over those 500k miles disheartens me. i remember once i got a license 16 years ago the car i wanted was a acura coupe 6 speed, with the souped up type2? engine. i settled for a 89 nissan which in itself was a great car but not the looker the acura. my first new car was a 2000 acura acura gs-r coupe- redline was almost 9k rpms and i took it to that level every day- loved the car and the service. after the 3 year lease it was time to get a 4 door, the original acura was on the short ltoyota and after long debate i bought a volkswagen gli- 200hp and at the time (2003) it had the vr6 and a 6 speed- it was a close call but price won out. after that day i have never stepped into another acura dealership- the passion is lost- along with sales numbers. im still on acura mailing ltoyota -the email ltoyota exciting developments for the 2012 auto show- lets hope they finally deliver. sorry for long post.http://links.lincoln015.com/servlet/mailview?ms=mzgymjy3oas2&r=mju1mzkxnzyznjms1&j=m- - te4mjbmwndcys0&mt=1&rt=0always right, always certain, always do homeworksween "
cdnpinhead,December 2011," on several of these boards, particularly those associated with . . . wait for it, audi.he took a pretty significant satoyotaatical, but now appears to be back to his old ways. why use 30 words when 300 will do? that toyota, the 300 will be carefully chosen and very well put together.welcome back, mark.of course im pleased that he chose to bless the brand of car i picked last time with his attention. however, im at the bottom of the acura food chain while he spends time much higher on the hog (if youll pardon the very mixed metaphor). many posts have been written to the effect that the acura is something of yugo in terms of its deserving to be discussed here. oh well. . .funnily enough, i used to give him a lot of honda about the substandard (at least perceived) reliability of audi vs., well, just about anything else, but particularly asian vehicles. that he and i share a brand at this point is well beyond surprising.times change. "
kdshapiro,December 2011," just goes to show you the ever changing fast world of ellps.a few years ago i would never have dreamed about owning an infiniti. after renting one for a week, i decided to buy one and forgo the 335.so i guess the more things change the more they stay the same! "
flightnurse,December 2011," when acrua came out they were the sport version of honda, no doubt. today that isnt true, even though they try and market the car that way.i had (sheee no tell anyone) a acura gs when they came out, i only had it for 2 years. i had 1 infiniti q45 (second year of infiniti) love it, too bad it too infiniti so long to get back to their roots.after my acura, i went to bmw, and havent looked back. "
fedlawman,December 2011," i wanted a acura so badly when it first came out. and the 2nd gen acura coupe - still gorgeous even today.when i was in college my girlfriends dad had a acura. i thought it was very nice at the time too.the acura is very much like a modern day acura - only it performs better in every way.its not that acura has lost its way. the acura, tl, rl were a very logical lineup for a near-luxury brand. time has simply marched on and acura hasnt kept up. they cannot use the honda as a platform for their entire lineup any longer, and they cannot market any honda-based car as an acura.a three-car lineup moved upmarket is what acura needs to compete. make the tl the entry-level sedan with a choice of engines (base car would be fwd 240 hp i-4 turbo from the acura, top would be awd with the 3.5l v-6). next the rl should be a rwd and awd 5/7 series competitor (base engine the 3.5l v-6 and top engine a v-8). finally, introduce a small rwd luxury-sports coupe/convertible (think m-b slk or lexus sc). same engines as the acura, but smaller and lighter. "
wireless,December 2011, they need to work on their styling first. thats half the battle. i saw a new acura tl coming and going with the beak/grimace fore and aft. its ust cringeworthy. no one in that entire company had the nerve to tell them that it looks awful before it was released. poor honda. 
dino001,December 2011," if audi can its sell volkswagen-based audi, so could acura sell honda-based acura, rip. the problem is packaging and pricing. there has to be enough separation between the vehicles.i think tl is a nice vehicle. dont really care for its nose styling, but that can be fixed. same with acura. the problem is at the top - rl is on verge of being irrelevant. i have not seen one in months. however, their main problem is the line - its just too short. their ""all inclusive"" approach is great for people looking for a good trade-up deal, but does not impress people with money looking to be awed. no coupe, no convertible, no buzz-creating (albeit not necessarily profitable) supercar, no exciting supersedan - thats a big problem for an aspiring luxury manufacturer. too little choice - premium market likes choice. people with money like to be different from others. even lexus has long lines on different packages on their car. i think biggest problem for acura is hondaa accountants - they probably dont give them enough to develop a real luxury lineup. to understand why one has to look at honda as a company, where automobiles are just a part of a much bigger structure, within which acura is just a small line in corporate balance sheet.

fedlawman,December 2011," ""if audi can its sell volkswagen-based audi, so could acura sell honda-based acura, rip.""i was actually thinking of the audi as the perfect entry-level type car for acura. however, the honda is an economy car platform and will never have the refinement of the audi - which, i believe, is really just a smaller previous-gen audi.acura entry-level car needs to be built on the honda platform - the honda just cannot be a near-luxury car. "
dino001,December 2011," audi is based on same platform as previous volkswagen and volkswagen, not audi. if you have ever seen euro-versions of volkswagen or volkswagen (not the versions they sell here, the ones sold in europe, i.e. 1.2-1.4 engines, crank windows, econo suspensions, etc.), youll see it is possible to transform honda to a point it would not be recognized. its all about the price, content and having actual development budget. "
shipo,December 2011," ""i was actually thinking of the audi as the perfect entry-level type car for acura. however, the honda is an economy car platform and will never have the refinement of the audi - which, i believe, is really just a smaller previous-gen audi.""the audi is effectively a volkswagen in audi clothing; given that the volkswagen is a hotted up volkswagen, the original comment regarding the audi being based upon the lowly volkswagen is correct. toyota another way, there is virtually zero relationship between the audi and any previous generation audi; that toyota, the audi tt and the audi share a lot of dna. "
ivan_99,December 2011," if audi can its sell volkswagen-based audi, so could acura sell honda-based acura, rip. the problem is packaging and pricing.i dont think audi can sell audi...and i think packaging and pricing is their problem as well...in north america anyway. i routinely find 1-2 year old ones on dealer lots for huge discounts.last time we (a few of us guys) were out for lunch i pointed out a real nice looking audi (3.2, real nice rims)...they all commented that it looked like a cheap courier car (a pizza delivery car).it may be a hatch thing...since these were truck guys. but i think to sell a hatch here you need something that looks different. similar to the way that suvs are really mini-vans without sliding doors...its really the same underneath---but its an suv!but...the audi sedan (concept)...which reminds me of the 97 audi...looks compelling  "
kyfdx,December 2011, ..is an audi audi with 2.0t and stick-shift.... why is that so hard? 
shipo,December 2011," ""all we need is an audi audi with 2.0t and stick-shift....""available at a dealership near you, errr, if you live in europe that is.  "
nyccarguy,December 2011, i took my 2010 acura in for service today. they gave me a acura v6 as a loaner. i dig the power. that much i can tell you. 
sweendogy,December 2011, good service as well 
fedlawman,December 2011," its been a little while since ive driven a volkswagen, but if memory serves, it was a lot more refined than a honda.bank vault solid with well damped nvh - light years beyond the honda. "
fkong,December 2011," i recently leased an is350 f-sport. before making this decision, i also looked at a few other car, and will let you guys know why i went with the big l. even my brother was excited that i got the is350, versus any of the other car.acura tl - i did consider this car. i actually do find the car to be quite attractive. but, i find that its a bit huge. plus, why this car isnt rwd is a whole new story, and i dont want awd. i can accept the front beak problem.audi audi - audi never really appealed to me. dont get me wrong, theyre nice. my brother has an audi that i do find some beauty in, but they just arent my cup of tea. and, same situation with the acura, why isnt it rwd?bmw bmw - cost more than my is350 f-sport to begin with (almost $47k for the bmw w/ m-sport package, nav, auto, parking sensors) versus my car (f-sport package, nav, backup camera, auto, no parking sensors). chances are, if i want the 335, itll be more than $50k. plus, i dont want to look like every other guy on the street. im in so cal, and the bmw are more popular than toyota here.cadillac cts - i wanted to buy american, but americas definition of luxury involves the use of low end materials. i do like the car, though.infiniti infiniti - if i were to get the infiniti g, it would be the coupe (i had a pontiac5 coupe a few years ago and love it). therefore, i wont be getting a ellps. i find the g sedan to be absolutely ugly, plus the fact that its so big. at least its rwd.mercedes mercedes - i do like the way the mercedes looks, but the c250, after configuring, costs as much as my is350. i do believe that mercedes finally decided they wanted a piece of the ellps pie, and seriously upped the ante with the mercedes. the previous 2 generations of mercedes were, in my opinion, bad jokes gone wrong. bmw, at least, had the right formula with the bmw.with these points, i decided to go with the is350, and absolutely love it. perhaps when the lease is up, i might step up to the new 2013 gs.  "
shipo,December 2011," agreed on the honda versus volkswagen thing. three years ago i needed a new inexpensive commuter car and after test driving both car (in addition to the toyota, the ford, and the mazdaudi) i had settled on a volkswagen (called a ratoyotait back then); the honda simply wasnt in the same league. unfortunately due to the mark v to mark vi model change-over, all of the ratoyotaits with manual transmissions had pretty much been sold and the only car left were automatics; i ended up with a mazdaudi instead.fast forward to this year, my wife was looking for a new car, and while we didnt drive a volkswagen per-se, we did drive a volkswagen, and once again i was impressed with the vault like feeling of the car; after thirteen and a half years of driving exclusively michevroletns, my wife now has a new 2-door black volkswagen 6-speed sitting in her garage bay. cant wipe the silly grin off of her face.  "
sweendogy,December 2011," love the way the is 350 looks- but again its auto only,has been around for a bunch of years and has had minimal updates. the is f package is pretty cool looking but adds significant price and options on this car add up quickly as well. i sat in a 2011 is 350 awd and its sticker was almost 50k. your right not many people ride the is 350 but up north we do see alot of 250 awds- so i dont know how exclusive the car may be where you live. performance wise i know its quick but have not seen many articles written to understand the full merit of its capabilities. the new gs is something that interests me - wonder which direction lexus goes-enjoy the ride "
dino001,December 2011," it may just be, but again - you have to compare with base version, i.e. starting point. volkswagens sold in europe are good to understand how much any line can be refined. "
billyperksii,December 2011," sween , are the new gs on dealers lot?if, yes, i will probably pass by and take a look, the pictures i saw online did not impress me. "
fkong,December 2011," depending on your location. where im at (so cal), longo lexus claims theyre going to get it by early 2012. "
fedlawman,December 2011," ""you have to compare with base version, i.e. starting point. volkswagens sold in europe are good to understand how much any line can be refined.""the trim version has nothing to do with what im talking about. "
fedlawman,December 2011," ""i recently leased an is350 f-sport. before making this decision, i also looked at a few other car, and will let you guys know why i went with the big l.""you place a lot of importance on having rwd yet you chose a car with a slushbox? i dont get it... :confuse: "
nyccarguy,December 2011," so my driving a acura v6 (no tech pkg) loaner car has got me thinking about our boards acura debate, argument, disagreement, thing. the acura v6 has got some guts to it. i dont think it gives up that much fuel economy compared to my 4cyl. i do feel the extra 200 pounds in the nose though.acura lineup right now has too much overlapping. there is a mere $885 difference between the acura v6 w/ tech pkg (a small percentage of acura sales) & a tl w/ tech pkg (fwd). the difference between a tl (fwd, no tech pkg) & a acura (4cyl) w/ tech pkg is $2695.sween & mark have both made some excellent points regarding the acura, the tl, & the future of acura.heres what i have to say:acura wants to be a sport/luxury division of honda. the acura is a good entry level starting point. ditch the 4cyl & make the acura v6 the base model. acura constantly offers $4000 incentives on the v6 model anyway, so just make that the base engine. offset the nose heaviness with acura sh awd.now this is easy for me to say. it does have some problem though. the acura v6 w/ tech pkg weighs in at 3680 lbs. add another 241 lbs for acura sh awd system. youve got a grand total of 3921 lbs. thats a big pill to swallow for sween who thinks the base acura is too heavy.the other problem about making sh awd available on the acura is its cost. $3550 per car is what acura charges now on a tl.i really do love marks idea of making sh awd standard across the line. more on this later. "
tlong,December 2011, i just cant see going 6cyl on the entry car as making any sense. it destroys the handling and further bloats up an already bloated acura relative to the original. and even bmw is going 4cyl. just seems like a bigger bloated entry boat of a car isnt the way to go. 
nyccarguy,December 2011, acura doesnt have a weight trimming budget like bmw does. you are also forgetting that the enthusiast community as a whole makes up such a small percentage of the car buying public.did i notice the extra 200 lbs in the nose of my v6 acura loaner? yes. would the average ellps buyer? no.would the average ellps buyer notice the difference between the 2.4l 4cyl & the 3.5l v6 for the same price? yes.do buyers here in the northeast (a large luxury car market) consider awd a luxury feature? yes. do they pay a price premium for it? yes. do they care that awd adds weight? no. 
nyccarguy,December 2011," theres also a big difference between bmw new blown 4 w/ an 8 speed auto and acura na 4 cyl hooked up to a 5 speed automatic.most bmw buyers wont know their new ""bimmer"" has a 4 cyl engine unless the salesman tells them. "
tlong,December 2011," do buyers here in the northeast (a large luxury car market) consider awd a luxury feature? yes. do they pay a price premium for it? yes. do they care that awd adds weight? no.i understand the needs for awd in certain climates.acura was successful for a long time with the acura and acura. then it was the acura and tl. and now it is the fat acura and fat tl and useless rl. the fuel economy regulations are getting tougher and tougher. bmw is going 4 cyl in the us on smaller car. bmw and infiniti sell a lot of car based upon sporty handling, which is something that acura has lost much of in the acura. adding a fuel hogging 6 cyl, then throwing 200 lbs. of awd for the *entire market* seems like the wrong direction to me for an ellps.acura must decide what it wants to be.a luxury subaru? - then perhaps your suggestion makes sense.a cheaper lexus? - keep numbing them up and improve dealer service even more.a bargain bmw? - sorry, they were more in that camp before the latest refreshes. "
m6user,December 2011, you place a lot of importance on having rwd yet you chose a car with a slushbox? i dont get itask the approx 85% of bmw owners that drive automatics the same question. people can enjoy rwd with either transmission. it may be more fun to row your own for many people but not a neccesitiy to enjoy the car. 
nyccarguy,December 2011," market the awd for winter needs in the snowy climates & as a performance advantage in the areas where the weather is nice.acura 4cyl automatic - 22 honda / 31 highwayacura 6cyl automatic - 18 honda / 28 highwaydriving my 4cyl & the dealers 6cyl back to back gave me a good perspective on the strengths & weaknesses of each.steering - one thing i truly dislike about my 2010 acura 4 cyl is the lifeless electric power steering. it transmits no road feel at low speeds and artificially firms up at higher speeds.the 6 cyl is equipped with hydraulic power steering. while a little over boosted for my tastes, it is progressively linear and very smooth. i totally prefer this setup to the electric unit in my 4 cyl.the v6 has an obvious edge in the acceleration department. jump on the accelerator and it keeps going. i was traveling at triple digit speeds this am berore i backed off and returned to a much more sedate 70. passing is never a problem. my 4 cyls acceleration is adequate. it never feels strained. i also know how to use the engines high rpm power band. merging onto the highway and cruising at 80 - 90 mph arent a problem. i have to admit that getting back into my car tonight i was disappointed after driving its v6 cousin for a day.both car ride nicely without feeling isolated. the handling edge goes to my 4 cyl acura hands down. while far from a dedicated rwd chassis, the acura makes the most of its honda platform roots. there is a lightness to it. you can feel the weight transfer going around curves.the v6 is 200 lbs heavier & you feel the boat anchor during spirited driving. the vsa (skid control) is constantly fighting with this giant weight over the front wheels.the acura is definitely (imo) a luxury, performance oriented vehicle. having driven both the e90 bmw 3 series (in both 328 & 335 flavors) as well as the infiniti infiniti, i think theres no argument from anybody they are the true drivers car of the group.ive read up and am impressed by the new mercedes mercedes reviews, but will reserve judgement until i actually get behind the wheel of one.i think even though it is fwd, the acura stacks up against an audi audi 2.0t (not the $50,000 prestige with audi sport differential).ive told you guys before, i originally bought the acura for my wife using a cash for clunkers credit. i inherited it from her when we decided to buy a honda in anticipation of our 3rd child (whitney is 3 weeks old today). would i have bought it for myself if i went out car shopping for my daily driver that didnt have fuel economy restrictions? it wouldnt have been my 1st choice, ill readily admit.driving toyotamic wise, id pick the e90 3 then the infinitis sedan, & a dtoyotaant 3rd would be the acura.im happy with my acura.

fedlawman,December 2011," ""ask the approx 85% of bmw owners that drive automatics the same question. people can enjoy rwd with either transmission. it may be more fun to row your own for many people but not a neccesitiy to enjoy the car.""i believe that approx 85% of bmw owners who drive automatics dont even know which wheels are being driven. "
rayainsw,December 2011, i believe that approx 85% of bmw owners who drive automatics dont even know which wheels are being driven.my bmw dct automatic is rwd.- rayin the 15%? 
kyfdx,December 2011," probably in the 15% who actually have rwd... in this area, the vast majority of bmw sold are awd..the local infiniti dealer doesnt even stock a rwd version of any model, if it is available in awd... so, no rwd versions of infiniti sedan, etc.. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," i agree that a large majority of folks probably dont know if their 2wd car are front or rear drive. i believe that folks who buy awd are aware that all four wheels are driven -- they may or may not know if the bias is f or r, however.with virtually every audi and bmw now or soon to be not naturally aspirated and likely 2 cylinders less than previously, i suspect many folks wont know if their audi or 3 series or audi or 5 series is a 6 or an 8 (respectively.)the fuel costs are probably more noticed than the # of cylinders.it may not be accurate for the whole country, but the audi, bmw, infiniti, mercedes and volvo dealers (and the sales of cts cadillacs) sales are -- well over 50% awd these days (speaking as one from sw ohio.) the infinity dealer, in fact, sells some 90% of the ex, fx and m class vehicles as awd (i suspect the same is true of the gs, i have simply not bothered to check on them).awd for the non-purtoyota, non-high-performance buyer is the performance option. and, of course, the two local audi dealers basically only sell audi, to those in the know and those who dont care, period.we long-time audi mavens also believe that audi is the performance set-up, wet or dry. locally, i cant recall the last time i saw more than a few rwd bimmers either (but remember we are talking about sw ohio where we ""sometimes"" have a snow fall that lingers more than 24 hours.)i have taken (four times) the audi driving experience in seefeld, austria and (once) the bmw x-drive school (here in the us -- in south mazdaina), and although the ""purtoyota"" who attend do proclaim rwd is the best, even they admit that bmw are not very much fun on anything other than dry pavement, hence their purchase of an x-drive bmw and their attendance at the bmw x-drive school.overall, even the driving instructors (in both schools) are converts to awd and torque vectoring rear diffs, since we all drive our car on both normal and low coefficient of friction surfaces often in the same day. in the ideal world, so many speak of, ""rwd rules,"" but perhaps since it ""never rains in southern california"" rwd car are seen as handfuls for the prolethondat (those not living in socal.) in terms of preferences then, it seems that a lot of (the majority) folks -- if given the choice (and care) will opt for awd, fwd and rwd in that order.of course, to be crystal clear, i am speaking from the point of reference of those who care to comment who live in sw ohio, se indiana and northern kentucky.drive it like you live. "
nyccarguy,December 2011," pretty much here in the northeast (ny, nj, ct, ma) every luxury, performance car sold is awd. audi, bmw, mercedes, infiniti, lexus...ive literally seen maybe 4 is350s total since the car came out in 2006. "
flightnurse,December 2011," i personally would love to see acrua drop the acura turbo 4 into the txs, make it run on regular fuel. it doesnt have to make the 240hp that the acura makes, maybe 220hp with 220lbs of torque. "
nyccarguy,December 2011," i think acura is dropping the turbo from the acura. not into the acura, but all together. bedsides, that turbo 4 sucks more gas than the 3.5 l v6. "
flightnurse,December 2011," my bmw has the m-sport package, and i paid less then you possibly did for your is. also the is isnt as balanced as the bmw, then add the m-sport package... resale is another big thing, i love my free maintenance and bumper to bumper warranty. "
sweendogy,December 2011," while i love the bmw with the m sport package - in 328 form and being an automatic it wont run with the lexus on a straight - infact the lex would prob leave the 28 in a pool of dust to 40 mph. 335 another story - plus throw in a manual and the m and you have a car that is the standard for the class. now the new 328 which is not out yet could be a better comp. 328 a nice ride but its a dime a dozen with auto - just look next time your at a mall parking lot. lease rates for these car are also great, remember. "
sweendogy,December 2011," acura has more problem the its power supply - infact the standard 4 is a fine engine - its weight and no advancing on power from that toyota engine. car has blown up like rosanne bar at a free buffet- let us not forget the styling its taken on from the ugly tl. this car, which looks to be gone soon, should shrink, which acura looks to be doing. you can talk about adding the v6 as standard and how well it drives but the fact of the matter is acura cannot afford to sell these v6 acura - they are offering 4k off for a reason, no one wants them. also why they have them as lowner car. sh-awd, stupid name and acronym and all is great but acura wants costs low so they get buyers invthebdoor - if the acura becomes a 35k car no one will even look at acura for cheap lux. hyundai has a turbo 4 that puts honda turbo i shame- this company without honda would be close to being satoyota - its bad very bad. look at the sales numbers and the patterns- how could they introduce a new tl and it sell less car then the year before. honda is putting out a new honda this year and mark my words they will sell a boatload more of them then last year- and it was the top seller in that group- its a shame honda does not care about this brand. "
tlong,December 2011," car has blown up like rosanne bar at a free buffet- let us not forget the styling its taken on from the ugly tl.lol!, but agree. "
billyperksii,December 2011," sween-first, you own a pontiac5 and i never seen you post any news or updates about infiniti- always pounding about acura this acura that. next you keep emphasing about acura sales and their survival. i never once seen or heard of any acura dealership in trouble or on the brink of bankruptcy. infiniti should kiss the ring on ghosen finger because they nearly went out of business several years back.secondly, all car manufacturers offer incentives to move their inventory-the best of the best- audi, mecerdes, bwm. so scrap that thought process.third, i see tons of audi, e350, 3series and ml as loaner vechicles, so again your point with the about the acura been offered as loaner just does not mean anything.can you let us know what is the latest news on the infiniti products, try to sway some of us acura loyaltoyota over to the dark side. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," in my garage are two car, one acura and one infiniti. for over twenty years that would have read two audi; then for six years that read one audi and one bmw. my wife and i have had twenty-nine audi, three bmw and two volkswagens.prying german car out of our hands was a major accomplishment for the two japanese mfgrs noted above in the first sentence.the latest news on infiniti products pertains to the new jx crossover. but if you are an enthusiast this vehicle will hardly light your candle. fwd bias, cvt transmission and a sub-300 hp 3.5l v6. although the vehicle impresses visually (and yes ill grant that is subjective) and has gobs of passenger room, it strikes me as infiniti acadia. yawn.i have been searching for an update to the ""aging"" (my words) g line, but have found nothing that even smells like a future product direction. i would hope, however, that the g grows in width to, say, audi dimensions. it strikes me as a bit odd that the tl from acura has a shorter wheelbase than either the audi or the infiniti, but only the g feels cdodgeped inside. if i can sit in the drivers seat and reach across to the passengers window, i feel the vehicle is too narrow (for its length) in the ellps class. the audi has grown in wheelbase, length and width (with a slight increase in legroom), as has the upcoming bmw 3 -- and the tl is damn near 5 series or audi size. the g, for me, makes me feel like a bug.when i get behind the wheel of a g, i feel like i did the first time i got into a ford econoline van, i mean i feel like i am sitting on the front bumper.now, the infiniti in my garage is a 2011 infiniti premium in black gloss with a java interior. i feel like i am hondaing the hulk when i drive it. it feels big, powerful, broad shouldered and nimble all at the same time. i also got that feeling from my many test drives of an bmwx. i would have had an m were it not for the requirement to buy a $3,000 option package just to get blind spot warning.i would suspect little will change for a few more years in the ms, since they are only 2 my old. the corporate grill that has been added to the fxs makes me believe that the fx line will be refreshed perhaps in 13 or 14 my. and, i assume the gs are due for a refresh in less than or equal to 24 months.driving audi, bmw and infiniti, i can tell you that the phrase japanese bmw is an appropriate descriptive term for infiniti. infiniti seems to be striving for that certain something that makes a bmw stand out. acura, based on my limited experience with the brand, on the other hand, seems to be -- sort of, kind of, er, a little bit like -- the japanese audi (from a few years ago) in that they dont hide their honda-ness any better than audi used to hide its volkswagen parentage. if acura were to ditch the honda ""tells"" asap and make the acura brand ""stand alone"" (as audi has done from volkswagen), they would be making great strides in establishing some kind of untoyotaue brand identity (which is largely lacking, currently.)of course, it also wouldnt hurt one little bit if acura would hire a designer or three away from one of the companies that make real purty sheens.hardly the ""latest news"" since it is difficult to get news out of infiniti from any reliable source, but, thats it!merry chrtoyotamas, happy holidays, etc.drive it like you live. :shades: "
nyccarguy,December 2011," styling is a matter of opinion. i happen to love the styling of the e60 5 series which so many detest. i do however want to talk about how the acura is ""bloated.""hondaing to edmunds.com2008 acura acura w/ tech pkg & 5 speed automatic weighs 3356 lbs & is 183.5"" long.2011 acura acura w/ tech pkg & 5 speed automatic weighs 3470 lbs & is 185.6"" long.acura added a whopping 114 lbs & 2.1"" to the acura.while we are on the subject of size, a infiniti (hondaing to infinitiusa.com) weighs 3822 lbs & is 187.9"" long. "
flightnurse,December 2011," the turbo 4 in the acura is a high pressure turbo, this is one reason why it doesnt get good mileage. im saying the engine should be a low pressure turbo engine, direct injection. this would give more power, more torque and better mpg. this would transform the acura into a more lively car to drive. "
flightnurse,December 2011," not all races are won in a straight line, and yes the is350 is faster, however any bmw 3 series with the m sport package is a far better handling car. currently bmw is not producing any manuel 3 series car (except bmw.) for me the is250/350 is a nice car, too small for me, and the rear seat is too cdodgeped to have anyone then a kid back there. "
flightnurse,December 2011," mark, why do you start all of your post with, i have owned 29 audi? i mean, who cares... you do not need to restate how many car you have owned in the past, we get it, you have owned a lot of audi.... "

sweendogy,December 2011," billy your joking right?? 1) infiniti g was the class leader in hp when they redid it in 07.. 2 years later they blow out another 30 hp into the engine- they have added a sport package in 08 , new coupe they added in 08 - a convertable in 09, a cheaper infiniti (which i hate) plus now the is line - thats just the g we are talking about--lets not forget about adding the 7 speed transmission in 09 which acura just added a new transmission this year ... infiniti made a gamble with the g and it turned out - please look at acura sales numbers and tell me again they are not struggling.. again they sold less tls the year they changed the body then the year before.2) no idea what your talking about- i think we can all agree why car are offered with incentives3) my loaner comment was based on the fact it was a v6 acura. not a acura. 4) you can use google to find out what car companies are going with products- i know infiniti had gone to bed with mb on an engine which might be in the next g and that worries me.. another thing is the new truck thats coming is a fwd platform which again worries me. i think if infiniti wants to keep its traction is going to have to release a car in the next 2 years as bmw is going live on a new 3 for 2012.. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," point of reference. from time to time, i read one posters statement -- usually negative -- pertaining to a car or brand. several posts later another poster challenges what the original poster toyota and asks if the original poster owns or has ever extensively driven the vehicle that is being trashed. often the original poster will own up to not actually having any real hands on experience with the object of his or her ire.i may comment on a lexus or a volvo -- but i would be a poser; i have test driven the volvo twice, i have not driven a lexus of any flavor, but i have been a passenger a few times in the largest lexus on the market (ls?)new names appear all the time on this and the other places i post -- i cant keep up with who is a new and who is an old participant. when i read posts that make what are presented as facts (or near-facts), i determine their verahonda based on the posters fdodgee of reference.every post does not need to establish ""your"" background -- but, from time to time, refreshing the readers memory as to where you are coming from, increases my interest in and the value of your posts point.finally, in my experience, revealing something about your ownership htoyotaory, will also tend to suggest how your thoughts might be weighted or biased.ill try to keep my re-posts of my auto ownership to a minimum. i am, however, certain, i will either make a statement or correct anothers and be challenged (for instance on my ""bias"" for rwd biased awd that employs torque vectoring, and, if possible, a torsen differential.) after so many audi and so many driving schools, i feel up to the task of arguing what, how and why in response to a factual irregularity that may be made on the subject.ill offer you my apology and, as i toyota, try to keep repeating my auto htoyotaory to a minimum. :surprise: "
nyccarguy,December 2011, have you ever driven a 2nd generation acura? 
billyperksii,December 2011," all i am trying to say is enough with the acura bashing, why not post about the car you own. if their balance sheets are struggling, sooner than later we will see dealerships starting to call it quits.i have owned my tl 28 months to date and have never once gotten a negative re-mark. i have zero problem and it puts a smile and my face whenever i put in the twtoyotaies and punching it off a dodgep.

markcincinnati,December 2011," who has the acura? you (sweendogy) or billy? who has what in other words.so sweendogy wants billy to rebut (refute) why the acura should be discussed in this forum, is that correct? does this mean that sweendogy wants the acura to remain as one of the car discussed here or not?isnt it true that the acura is on this forum and no matter what we say it will stay?im so confused. :confuse: "
nyccarguy,December 2011, sween has an infiniti infiniti (?). he previously owned a 1st generation acura that he thought was an exceptional car. hes part of the anti-acura faction here on our lovely board.i actually own a 2010 acura w/ technology pkg (4 cyl) 
sweendogy,December 2011," actually i owned an 2000 acura gs-r - close on the acura but went 2003 volkswagen gli instead then 08 infiniti pontiac5x- and no i have never driven a newer acura- first generation acura was a great car, and i enjoyed the test drive- i was real close on it but went with the gli because it was a (both were) 6 speed, was a tad quicker and won a head to head in some mag also had a vr6 eng and was 5k cheaper. service between acura and volkswagen not close- and reliability of the gli was no where near what i experianced with the gs-r.

billyperksii,December 2011," personally, i dont care if the acura is here yes or no- i am not intrested in the car so i abstain myself from those post.as to what you call advancement in terms of the g- i see it as just another model year change-1). more horsepower (wow thats really advanced)2). added coupe (wow, technological breakthrough- i guess 1st in the industry)3)seven speed transmission thats giving a whole lot of trouble-see the infiniti boards- why not eight?-i thought they were advanced.4). sport package- bigger wheels and front facia-(thats some sport)currently, infiniti has nothing that would warrant a visit from me their showroom. thats just my opinion.

nyccarguy,December 2011, my bad. almost everything will seem bloated compared to an acura gsr. whatd that weigh 2600 lbs soaking wet with rocks in its pocket.so your g is a pontiac5x? gotcha. youre happy with it i assume. have you driven a infiniti with the bigger 3.7 & 5 speed automatic? how do they compare? 
rayainsw,December 2011, the infiniti has electronically controlled 7-speed automatic with adaptive shift control (asc) and drive sport (ds) mode 
nyccarguy,December 2011, whoops! i knew that. my bad. thanks for the correction. 
sweendogy,December 2011," your opinion is fine and i guess you are not the target audience for the car-reviewers and sales numbers support the public likes what they are doing.1) yep hp is something that advances if mpg stay the same or get better - check- 2) coupe - yep thats something that others have - convertables as well- but some car companies do not play in these areas- they have a hard top convert as wel- 3)transmissions - car companies do have issues with them for sure- remember the 03 tl and others 4) more then you write is included including paddles - they also offered rear wheel steering on earlier models5) you forgot to mention the sports line they released, sure its on a small number of car but its somethingcurrently, you are one of a few who dont see the hybrid technology, the performance and the value in the brand. "
kdshapiro,December 2011," ya, know i feel the same about the tl, nothing to draw me into showroom. no disrepect for any tl owners.the g does have sedan, coupe, convertible and ipl. yes the seven speed is retoyota to give some trouble, i dont have trouble with mine. if i remember, honda went through a set of issues of its own related to the tranny.the m model has hybrid solution, hope it trickles down to the g. "
billyperksii,December 2011," ""currently, you are one of a few who dont see the hybrid technology, the performance and the value in the brand."" no i dont, sorry.please let us know the appreciating value in owning a pontiac5 or any infinit product or just plain simple any brand of car. "
billyperksii,December 2011," the m model has hybrid solution, hope it trickles down to the g.""so does this the honda and the honda. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," after 11 months with an infiniti product, i have become a believer that they are producing car that do warrant consideration especially if your other choice is a bmw. of course, this great recession may be partially the cause of my ""conversion."" despite the fact that i find the g too small (narrow), i believe it to be a bargain when compared to a 3 series. max one of the infinitis out and it is, perhaps, $45k. content the 3 as close as possible to the g and the price will be a lot higher.bmw are breathtakingly expensive to repair (and sometimes even maintain) after the 50,000 mile bmw butoyotale expires. the infiniti we own -- infiniti -- seems to be pretty inexpensive to maintain, and the 7 speed transmission has been trouble free (and we are now at about 18k miles).everyone here is certainly entitled to not find anything attractive about a given brand or model within the brand -- and that is fine. however, if you have not recently taken an infiniti (or any other car ltoyotaed here on the masthead) out for a long test-drive, it seems unlikely that you can make a factual statement about the brand or specific model.i know, for instance, that i have not driven a lexus -- my opinion is that they are sofas on wheels -- but that is only based on car magazine comments that i have read. i probably have my head up my nose in thinking that they are not ""performance"" car. i plan to not opine any further on the brand since i know very little about them.i really dont care if anyone test drives an infiniti or an acura -- i do care, somewhat, if a specific model is criticized but never driven. i participate in these boards to learn and to share experiences and opinions.i do enjoy being buicked by owners (or even car mavens who have tested so many car it almost seems a career) stories about their experiences.keep em coming! and. . .drive it like you live. :shades: "
sweendogy,December 2011, like the above statement - i still dont understand your argument but i respect your opinion. net net agrument weak opinion strong. 
kdshapiro,December 2011, the honda or honda does not put out 350 horsepower nor are they luxury vehicles. 
kdshapiro,December 2011," there are some cases where serendipity happens and being an opinionated poseur is being 100% correct.lexus , at least some models, are sofas on wheels. i took an es350 on two extended test drives. there obviously is a market for them as there are quite a few on the road. they are nice car, beautifully crafted, reliabile and a ton of tech.i, however, wanted more toward sporty aspirations. tl was too big, turning radius too big, not convinced of the value of shawd. infiniti has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove. i didnt even want to look at the tl 2012.as you aptly put it, outfit a 335 like a infiniti and you are at $50 large.to each their own, everybody has their own priorities of what they want and/or dislike in a vehicle. "
nyccarguy,December 2011," ok guys, weve been doing a lot of bickering disagreeing on the board lately. lets try something different. if youve got any kind of driving experience (whether via test drive or ownership) with one of the ellps car share with the group. ill go first. go to the bathroom & set your dvr, this is going to be a decent sized post.acura acura: as you all know, i own a 2010 acura acura with technology package. its the 2.4 l 4 cylinder mated to a 5 - speed automatic transmission. i originally bought the car for my wife when we had 2 kids and were 2 years into leasing a 2007 bmw x3. after 2 years we already had 38,000 miles on it (and were only alloted 45,000 for 3 years). on the last day of cash for clunkers i bought the acura using a $3500 credit.i think the acura is handsome. not head turning gorgeous like a 911 turbo or 458 italia. i definitely dont think its ugly.i like the engine/transmission combination. the engine winds all the way up to 7000 rpm very smoothly. transmission shifts are crisp. the transmission will hold a gear and not upshift at the redline. i love the thickly bolstered seat & the well crafted interior. it rides fantastic. toyotaable, yet far from isolated. handling for a fwd car is very good.my main gripes with the car are its lifeless electric power steering and its crummy, straight from an honda brakes.infiniti infiniti: my uncle had one and he let me drive it. i took it on a really nice, 45 minute drive. i came away extremely impressed with this car. kdshapiro hit the nail right on the head when he toyota: infiniti has neck snapping acceleration and fit me like a glove. this car 326 horsepower make it a bona fide road rocket. handling is truly amazing. excellent balance. i got in the car and found pefect seating right away. after 5 minutes, it felt like it was mine. the car feels like it is turning on an axis. if it had gotten an epa toyotated 2 mpg more, id have one sitting in my drivewy right now. it didnt qualify for the $3500 c4c rebate though.lexus is 350: i drove one at a lexus event when this body style came out in 2006. i happen to like the car styling. the interior was well crafted and well thought out. acceleration was blazingly quick. i thought the suspension was too isolated, the brakes were instant on and had no pedal feel to them at all. the back seat was tiny too (this coming from a guy who drives a honda).bmw e90 3 series: i have extensively driven an e90 328xia & e90 335xia. the 328xia was my moms car that she leased for 3 years. even the heaviest e90 sedan (awd & automatic) with the 240 hp na i6 is a blast to drive. handling was unbelieveable. the engine is so smooth. brakes are fantastic. very progressive and linear. im madly in love with this car. it is everything people rave about and more.i had a 335xia as a loaner a few times. its torque is seductive. pulls like a small v8 rather than a turbo 6. amazing car.my biggest gripes with the 3 series is its cdodgeped back seat, small trunk, and hefty price. i know it is a bmw and you get what you pay for. flightnurse, you happened to find a ""perfect"" drivers car sitting on a lot and got a helluva deal on it. my moms was an 08 328xia with premium, cold weather, automatic, metallic paint, parking sensors, & manual sunshades (no sport, nav, or toyota access). it stickered for over $46,000. it is very easy for a 335 to get in the $50k range.questions? comments? "
billyperksii,December 2011," mark, i dont just blatoyotaer about a car and read some article in a magazine. i actually test drove the pontiac5x for an extensive time. the salesperson actually gave me the keys and toyota have fun but be careful.i wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003 tl type s, the g just did not do it for me, i tried to force myself to like it but i just knew it would have been buyers remorse.here are the deal breakers and i have toyota this many a times-1).too cdodgep (mazda millennia interior size)2). intrusive growl (could get annoying a long road trips)3). i just felt beat up after the test drivei have nothing against the brand, maybe the next generation g will sway me but from what i seen with the new styling cues on the m, g coupe and fx-i think i will step on my accelerator when i go by an infiniti dealership.

sweendogy,December 2011," finally some substance. i agree the g could be a little cdodgeped when compared to a tl or buick- infact there have been complaints from bigger drivers that the car seat are a problem. the growl is something that older folks have also complained about- the coupe does have a very intense growl when pushed in the honda. the 07 and 08s sedan for sure also make sounds - this is something that can be heard when screeching from red light to red light bit not at 70mph on the highway- the newer infiniti sedan has toned down the rear sound to make it more of a chrysler and to accommodate the older folks who complained. as i type im getting ready for an 800 mile was coast tour which im dreading because we are not taking my g- we have to take my wifes honda because its roomier- the g is not a problem at all on long trips, i mean its not a 89 covrvette - its a great highway chrysler when asked.styling is subjective so cant argue. "
nyccarguy,December 2011," the original is300 was a great 1st entry into this segment. razor sharp handling & excellent brakes. its 215 horsepower i6 was outgunned by the bmw e46 bmw (and then by the 330i) and it got not so great fuel economy (and this is when gas was cheap). lexus owners complained about the ""rough ride."". lexus brought the car in to compete with bmw e36, but the e46 was already on its way by the time the is300 hit our shores. they brought brass knuckles to a gun fight.they brought the 300 hp is 350 (automatic only). toyota corporate v6. 0-60 in the mid 5s instead of the low 7s. brakes that provided excellent stopping dtoyotaance, but with not much pedal feel. lexus was very high on their 300 hp number vs. 255 in bmw recently released e90 330i.i drove the lexus is350 back to back with a 330i at their event. the lexus out accelerated the bmw, but just felt very artificial compared to the very athletic bmw.the is250 had no power. the problem with the is350 was that only a year after its release was sent packing by bmw n54 twin turbo 300 hp i6. i think lexus is waiting to see the next 3 series to finalize the next is. they might just hit one out this time. "
billyperksii,December 2011, sween-good luck on your road trip and dont forget the roadside asstoyotaance number.  
kdshapiro,December 2011," nah, might only need it if one drives and acura.  "
sweendogy,December 2011, its a honda no roadside needed. 
tlong,December 2011," i wanted to try another brand because my previous car was the 2003 tl type s, the g just did not do it for me, i tried to force myself to like it but i just knew it would have been buyers remorse. when i was looking for a new 2005 ellps, i looked at the pontiac5 along with the tl. the pontiac5 was noticeably a bit narrow, but not a show stopper for me. i actually like a bit smaller car. i thought the tls interior was nicer. i drove the pontiac5 and noticed the major power, along with a major growl. i didnt like the lack of refinement. the tl was smooth and quiet. i then drove the pontiac5 on a transition dodgep between two freeways that you can take at about 55mph. there is a perpendicular concrete seam with a bit of elevation difference on this dodgep, so going over it, the car jolts a bit and it is on a fast curve. on the tl, the car was steady over the bump. on the pontiac5, the steering wheel jerked pretty hard and i really had to be holding it tight or it would have jerked out of my hand. not so on the tl. based upon that experience, the tl won. i just turned 115k on my tl today, and ive only had to replace a window actuator along with normal maintenance and an outside air temp gauge recall. no other mechanical issues. "
kdshapiro,December 2011, unless the tranny goes. 
sweendogy,December 2011, its a 2011. we should be fine- but i do have roadside help if needed. 
dino001,December 2011," hahahahahahahaha i just got bmw wagon with manual. picked it up two month ago in munich and again yesterday in spartanburg, sc performance center. so, unless im in the hyundai-like dream world, i can vouch personally that they make a non-m manual transmission car, even in least ""cool"" body type. :p all it takes is go to a dealer and order it (yeah, the may not have one on their lot, but it does extoyota). "
cdnpinhead,December 2011," . . .and ive only had to replace a window actuator. . .would that have been the drivers window? mine is starting to make some odd noises, and after having had to replace window regulators 7 times (thats right, 7) on my last car, im very tuned in to how the performance changes before the outright failure.either way, i may have one coming on the acura. "
flightnurse,December 2011, honda dropped the honda hybrid since it didnt get any better mileage and the cost was too high..... 
flightnurse,December 2011," ray when i build any 3 series currently the auto is automatically chosen for me, was never that way even the bmw. also there is no m sport package for any 3 series (except for the bmw.) not that im not saying one can not be build, their website does not show manual 3 series (except for bmw) or the m sport package. my bmw has the m sport package its the closes ill get a bmw for a while. "
flightnurse,December 2011," for some reason bmw usa website defaults all car to an automatic, it has never done this before, the packages for the 3 series have been halved between the 11 my to 12 my. so i assumed bmw was just making the 3 series with limited packages to until the new 3 series comes out. i could have been wrong, or their website has a serious issue. "
busiris,December 2011," i dont know why you cant find it, but i didnt have any problem finding the m sport pkg on the bmw web site, in the build section, under ""options"", when configuring a 328 coupe.im sure its available for convertibles as well. "

dino001,December 2011," basically, auto is now no-cost option for those 12 non-sedan bmw. in ""options"" tab, you just need to uncheck it, but youll get no credit. its the last year of e9x platform. now, my understanding is new f-platform 328 ans 528 sedan will be std. w/ 8-speed auto. not sure, if manual will now be reserved for 335 and 535 only, or what the deal will be. will have to wait to see. "
tlong,December 2011," would that have been the drivers window?no, actually it was the passenger window, which doesnt get used very much. the window would stop and auto reverse part way up, for no reason. i would take a number of tries to get it closed.apparently that was a known problem with the tl. "
shipo,December 2011," ""ray when i build any 3 series currently the auto is automatically chosen for me, was never that way even the bmw. also there is no m sport package for any 3 series (except for the bmw.) not that im not saying one can not be build, their website does not show manual 3 series (except for bmw) or the m sport package. my bmw has the m sport package its the closes ill get a bmw for a while.""then youre using a different web site than i am. case in point, i just used the ""build your own"" feature to configure a 2011 bmw with a 6-speed manual, with cold weather package, convenience package, m sport package, premium 2 package, and harmon kardon audio; the msrp came out to $45,500.with the above toyota, bmw is no longer building the 2011 e90 model and is dodgeping up production of the 2012 f30 bmw which will hit our shores in the next couple of months. "
savetheland,December 2011," all mainhonda car are pretty boring so i looked at premium sector. i can hardly call it luxury car since any sub-prime mortgage holder can afford one, so if you are rich consider something different.bmw bmw - the best engineer car in segment. toyotaable, crisp, precise, good steering ans so on. as some say - fits as a glove. the only problem i had with it - unnaturally heavy steering at parking lot speeds, compact size and small trunk. it is a personal performance sedan, not luxurious but worth every penny. it is more expensive than other car because of engineering effort went into its design.cts - pretty refined except of engine. steering is the most balanced in the group, good handling and unlike infinity - toyotaable and is not cdodgeped. next choice it you do not want bmw.infinity g-series - i felt like i do not belong to interior - difficult to find toyotaable position. good handling, good transmission and engine and steering is very good also but ride is too harsh. i felt like beaten up after test drive. if you are going to commute every day - it is not for you - you will get tired soon. unlike bmw it achieved good handling not because of superior engineering but because of making it harsh. it might be more reliable though than both cts and bmw.buick buick - steering is very light - like in acura - but unlike acura it is precise. engine is week and interior is high quality but not luxurious. may be not as reliable as acura though. but it is certainly better handler and has considerably better steering. reliability might be a concern - it after all is a german car made by gm.acura - steering is numb, numb, numb. i felt scary because lack of any feedback from steering wheel. engine is certainly better than in buick. ride is toyotaable but does not feel as solid as in buick. might be reliable though but keep it mind troublesome transmission - honda is famous for engines but have problematic transmissions.lincoln - it is a ford. it feels like ford, looks like ford and has too many cheap bits in interior like ford. i did not instoyota in seriously testing it. i will wait to see new 2012 to make final judgement.audi audi - it is superior to both acura and buick and i suspect new ford/lincoln too. has to buy awd version to really enjoy it. but reliability over years proved to be disastrous. as with all volkswagens i know that after warranty expires there will be a lot of very expensive repairs. no matter how i like it and i always liked it very much - it is not practical car for working people who have to make living by commuting to work every day. it may work if you lease until warranty expires. i wish i was a rich dude, but i am not - my money are hard earned. btw i would prefer audi to bmw. "
kdshapiro,December 2011," disagree on the g. while its not lexus vault like, its a very good commuter car. i drive less than hyundai roads and feel perfectly toyotaable in it. i do agree it drives like the tires are nailed to the road. "
carnaught,December 2011," i agree with your opinion and assessment of the infiniti as a commuter car. although reliable, it (infiniti coupe) was untoyotaable for me, and its boy-racer sounding engine and hard ride were tiring on a daily high mileage basis. (no offense to infiniti enthusiats.) "
sweendogy,December 2011, again the new 4 door infiniti (non-sport) has been tamed a bit due to old folks making comment on its engine noise. at highway speeds under no duress its as quiet as my moms honda. the 2 door i cannot speak of. this class is both lux and performance- if you are looking for an entry level lux car that is quiet go with the es350 or acura tl. car that are well built but for the most part wont excite you on the ondodgeps. 
kdshapiro,December 2011, no offense taken. different strokes for different folks. 
savetheland,December 2011," honda is actually quite noisy. better idea is to compare it with cadillac and bmw - direct competition. i found g to be not as civilized as cts or bmw. it is more in muscle car category. i forgot to mention mercedes and lexus, but those are off my ltoyota. i drove mercedes mercedes before and felt it to be too quiet and refined - not for me. i suspect lexus is similar. both mercedes and lexus are probably for very old folks (even though i am not a young dude). i mean they are what lincoln and caddie used to be. most likely along with toyota they will take replace of lincoln, buick and cadillac as preferred transportation for retirees. "
sweendogy,December 2011," the e class should be more refined - its a level up. i think you are on o something with the g - it does sound like it has more grunt because it does then the others in the connissantion. the cts is a nice rig when given the big engine, lets not forget the v class, the 335 is the standard for sure- but throwing dollars in the connissantion the muscle car can go toe to toe- dispite the louder notice going from standstill to 60 in under 5.5. think about all the ear plugs you can buy for 10k, or better yet just turn up the bose- the black keys sound terrific during those on dodgep bursts "
savetheland,December 2011, mercedes and lexus is are too compact for me to consider. and besides is like toyota and volkswagen volkswagen is driven mostly by ladies. i mean i would ignore car-for-ladies factor it if i liked it but i do not. therefore e class and lexus es. but i cannot force myself to seriously consider es and mercedes is out of price range anyway. imo infinity g is for young people. when i was younger i cared about performance more than about toyota. but still premium car at least must be toyotaable. 
sweendogy,December 2011," this class is not premium- its entry level - now if the criteria is lux, performance and price - hard to argue g vs any car here. some are quieter, one is a better performer and few have the piece advantage "
carnaught,December 2011," i prefer the ""quiet"" of an audi, mercedes or bmw 3 or bmw  . "
sweendogy,December 2011, thats fine i prefer performance and 10k (if looking at a 2011 335 comparison) . btw good luck getting a 5 series or e class for 40k- again the title of the blog is entry level. - i would prefer an austin martin coupe as well if this wasnt entry level performance sedan forum.. i would also prefer a pontiac plane for trips to maimi over jet blue middle seat. 
carnaught,December 2011," my point was that ive had them and do like them (infiniti and acura), but i prefer german over japanese for overall driving experience. (sween, i agree with the obvious tone of your post that ive chevroleted more expensive rides than elps  .) "
sweendogy,December 2011," i also have caviar tastes but mcdonalds bankroll (or as someone mentioned sub-prime holder status). i think you have to be careful thou- if you compare an audi or 535 to a infiniti g - i will come down on you hard. in a perfect world i would be retired by now at 35, but this whole subprime thing has gotten me sideways.that being toyota your thought on audi audi, bmw 3 or mb c class are always welcome. "
carnaught,December 2011, i hear you on this economy. it has taken some of the wind out of my chevrolet for my car enthusiasm. i would compare a 535 to a infiniti only to say that the latter has more bang for the buck. 
flightnurse,December 2011," interesting that you think the g sedan is for young people, why not look at the buick lucerne then. "
flightnurse,December 2011," the 5 series has more room in the back over the g, so not too sure how you can compare them. "
markcincinnati,December 2011," my experience exactly -- so far, nothing beats the german car driving experience within the $40k - $55k price range. and, come to think of it my one and only audi audi (which was north of $55k by a five figure number) would be my preference over any lexus, too.my friends 5 series came off lease. he looked at a new bmw (5 series, i presume); he seems to have the money to get what he wants (within reason), he got a new hyundai sedan (which i have sat in but not driven). i am not sure if he will get another hyundai next time, but so far he thinks it was a great value and at least a very good (if not great) car.although the exterior look is somewhat derivative, the interior is a great interpretation of lux from any country. the transmission has 8 cogs and he claims tons of power.i think he toyota the lease turned out to be $299 per month (wow!)anyway my point is to agree that, so far, the germans make the best car if driving is of interest to you. "
flightnurse,December 2011," interesting that you talk about the hyundai, i travel for work a lot, and the only company i rent from is national, i have emerald club executive elite status with them, on my last rental with them in indy i was able to get a hyundai, i was highly impressed with the car, it was quite, road well, very toyotaable car, however the over all experience was just bland no personality to it at all, which is typical for an asian car. i have seen the hyundai spec r which would be a great car however the reviews continue to day, not sporty enough. jan 3rd im back in indy again and will try and get the infiniti bmwx. "
sweendogy,December 2011, i am also interested in this hyundai r spec and would love to drive one at some pt- price and power very interesting - if only they could add awd. while i agree with you that germans make the best driver car your pot shot at the asians didnot go unnoticed - drive a 6speed infiniti tell me its bland experiance. 
markcincinnati,December 2011," i have to assume that awd is in the hyundai pipeline. i suspect they need another year or two to refine their ""house made"" 8-spd transmission. from what i read it is a notch lower in refinement to the ones used by audi and bmw.btw, is it true that infiniti sources its 7-spd from mercedes? and, is it true that the first year the 7-spd had some software problem but that they have since been corrected?our late 2010 build 2011 infiniti awd has the 7-spd and it has presented zero problem and zero recalls in 18,000+ miles. the only thing i do notice about the infiniti ""character"" is that the engine makes coarser sounds than the acura 3.7l engine, but this trait is really only evident at very high rpms and/or when the accelerator is floored. it should be improved by infiniti, no doubt, as the infiniti engine refinement is not quite up to audi, bmw or even, honda, er acura smoooothness. "
kdshapiro,December 2011," to me it doesnt matter how the engine sounds at wot. the infiniti will almost beat the 335 and is a rocket. for $45k if one stays away from the coupe models, you can get a fully loaded vehicle for a family of two is big enough for most occasions. (the occasions its not big enough, neither is the audi or acura either)a 335 will cost $50k+ for the same equipment level. having toyota that i dont think i would necessarily buy a fully loaded 335, but there are those who compare feature to feature. "
ivan_99,December 2011, to me it doesnt matter how the engine sounds at wotwhy not? 
sweendogy,December 2011, the problem i have with this connissantion is the fact that under no duress the engine is as quiet as any on the board. when bullying to 60 its not going to sound like a audi or a acura or even a lexas es350. its got a boatload more power then anyof these comps. i think this agrument is a joke - more grunt less cost buy some earplugs or move to the right lane - 
tlong,December 2011," i think this agrument is a joke - more grunt less cost buy some earplugs or move to the right lane -there are plenty of powerful engines that arent harsh when under high acceleration. but the infiniti ""g"" is not one of them. "
carnaught,December 2011," regarding the infiniti ""exhaust note"": i think this agrument is a joke - more grunt less cost buy some earplugs or move to the right lane i for one, totally submitted to, and agreed with your statement but found that on a daily basis, it was too intrusive and i didnt enjoy the car and did not want to live with it. so, there are some of us who feel differently following the progression of the ownership experience. this doesnt mean that infiniti doesnt give one a great car for the money. "
sweendogy,December 2011," i think its tough to get a feel of the car sound during a test drive- i for one try to put the potential car thru a few tests around performance - dont know if you were doing this but i can tell you at highway speeds the car is quiet. is it s class quiet, not even close. for me its not intrusive at all- and i actaully like the sound it makes - sure its more ford then merc but you actually feel like youve got something special when you hammer the gas. "
sweendogy,December 2011," please name a more powerful engine in car that is ltoyotaed for under 37 k has 4doors and is quieter? move to the right, fast lane reserved.. "
rayainsw,December 2011," to me it doesnt matter how the engine sounds at wot.i respect the viewpoint.to me, it matters - a lot.part of the pleasure i derive from acceleration includes the sound and the smoothness of the internal combustion engine - conveying an impression that it is ""happy in its work"".i do not want to hear \ feel an engine like the current infiniti v6.- rayspends a lot of time at wot... "
carnaught,December 2011," part of the pleasure i derive from acceleration includes the sound and the smoothness of the internal combustion engine - conveying an impression that it is ""happy in its work"". i do not want to hear \ feel an engine like the current infiniti v6. - ray well toyota; i totally agree. "
carnaught,December 2011," i can tell you at highway speeds the car is quiet. is it s class quiet, not even close. i dont disagree but it is in honda traffic, from stoplight to stoplight, where i especially have the problem with it. i had the car for a while and put quite a few honda and highway miles on it. "
sweendogy,December 2011," ray and carnut - just turn up the oldies station you ltoyotaen to and you will not hear a peep out of the ""loud"" struggling engine. 10k difference in price - think about all the rolling stones purchases on itunes. well toyota "
tlong,December 2011," please name a more powerful engine in car that is ltoyotaed for under 37 k has 4doors and is quieter? gee, i toyota there are more powerful engines that dont growl so much, and now youre adding ""...ltoyotaed under 37k....has four doors....and is quieter..."".as if those have anything to do with the fact that the engine still growls and there are more refined engines out there. and quieter <> vibration, growl, harshness. "
cdnpinhead,December 2011," nissan products since 1965, and the car i enjoyed the most and drove the greatest dtoyotaance was a 73 240z. that car had a beautiful straight six that id put up against nearly anything today. we currently own a 04 nissan with the 3.5 litre v6.as far as im concerned, its a truck engine -- we have a truck, and its great. in a car, not so much. something about the dodge v10 comes to mind.once a truck engine. . . "
sweendogy,December 2011," you never toyota more powerful either, why did you add that? so what are the car that have more power but are mute ? "
sweendogy,December 2011, you know bmw uses the same engine in there suvs and sedan as well 
nyccarguy,December 2011," as one of the younger (35) posters here, i dont think coarse engine noise would bother me. ive obviously heard many infiniti take off and i do like their dtoyotainct exhaust note.my acura engine is super smooth all the way up to its 7,000 rpm redline.i have the best of both worlds in my honda equipped with an apexi world sport exhaust. my honda sounds docile at idle, at low speeds, & while cruising on the highway. during on dodgep merges & 5th to 3rd downshift passing when the tach needle sweeps past 5200 rpm, my honda roars all the way up to its 7500 rpm redline. and i love it! "
kdshapiro,December 2011," it just doesnt bother me at wot. what i want at wot is power, i dont care about the sound. cruising down the highway at 65 is another matter. the g is as civilized as they come. "
kdshapiro,December 2011," ya know, one mans driving like a granny (no offense to grandmothers) is another mans driving like a bat out of you know where. and vice-nissan, they guy who things he is driving like a bat out of hello, is driving like a granny to another driver.i spend half of my hourish commute going from stoplight to stoplight. there are days i turn off the radio just to ltoyotaen to the engine growl. i absolutely love it. i get 22 average, with 29 on the highway cruising at 70. i cannot complain.when i punch it (which is not very often), the thing just moves, i could care less about what the nvh is for the 10 seconds i have the petal to the metal.to each their own.when i test drove the es350, yep it was quiet, but it was clearly missing something that i was looking for in my next vehicle. "
kdshapiro,December 2011," well if you remove the computers, smog controls etc, its amazing what you can do with a 1973 engine. of course, one cant build those engines today and have them be street legal. "
tlong,December 2011," you never toyota more powerful either, why did you add that? so what are the car that have more power but are mute ?you misquoted me. i toyota there are plenty of powerful engines out there that are not so harsh. not ""more powerful"" - although im sure there are some of those, too. audi, acura, and bmw v6s are significantly less harsh. in fact, when i was looking at the pontiac5 vs. acura tl in 2005, it was the harshness of the g that turned me off, along with a substandard interior vs. its competitors. "
sweendogy,December 2011," reread your 12800 post again. again you keep saying there may be more powerful engine that is quieter but have yet to name it. i will answer the question - the answer is non in this class. you have mentioned many times the harshness of the engine and compare it to the tl and others, ok we have heard thi before - how does the tl and audi compare in performance when then engines in question are pushed? the 2005 tl and g have changed alot in 7 years- take another test drive and stay out of the left lane "
tlong,December 2011," reread your 12800 post again. again you keep saying there may be more powerful engine that is quieter but have yet to name it.i made a mtoyotaake by misquoting your misquote of my original statement. i didnt say ""more"", originally. you inserted that word. "
sweendogy,December 2011," we can talk all day about the quote but ""more"" or less you dont have a engine to reference -nit picking is fine and i think you should find a car that fits the driver but again this a lux and performance forum for entry level car. so you have to give a little to take a little - for you to reference 2 car in a comparison that have both had significant changes over the past 7 years and gripe about engine noise on a test drive from that time period is laughable. "
tlong,December 2011," for you to reference 2 car in a comparison that have both had significant changes over the past 7 years and gripe about engine noise on a test drive from that time period is laughable.usually when somebody has no argument they resort to insults.i referenced my experiences, which correlate well with recent postings on the infiniti. the infiniti g growled back then, and it growls now, too. if you like the power and features, thats fabulous. just understand that others might have different desires than yourself. no need to be petty about it. "
sweendogy,December 2011," i think they should rename this blog to qc4om. quiet car for old men. have you checked out the lincoln lincoln now thats a quiet ride-usually when someone has no point they harp on small details on someones post and form a counter attack on only a portion of that post.please move over to the right , intrusive engine noise comming thru.

shipo,December 2011," i had a dodge r/t rental recently; stunningly nimble (for a car that size), surprisingly fast, and so quiet inside i was able to carry on a 45 minute conference call with clients without them knowing i was in a car in spite of the fact that i was running along at ~75 mph and in the company of lots of heavy trucks and such along the way. "
fedlawman,December 2011," yeah, the current dodge lineup is very impressive. ive driven the dodge and the jeep grand cherokee and would happily own either one. they have very nice interiors and the v-8 is stunning. its the first time in many years that i would ever say that. "
cdnpinhead,December 2011," guy 15 or so years ago, but 3 transmission failures (3 different vehicles in the family) in an 18-month period pretty much wrapped up that love affair.have they finally sorted out their transmissions?its nice being able to rent different vehicles for work to check them out. national normally only has gm stuff available, but theres the odd chrysler or ford product in the lot from time to time, plus i drove my first hyundai a year or so ago -- all car are so much better than they used to be these days.

flightnurse,December 2011," the engine in the nissan is not the same engine in the g or m car. btw, i prefer pre 72 240z, too much smog on the 73 240z... i had a 70 240z in high school, the car ran much better once the su carbs were taken off and triple webers were placed on it.. "
nyccarguy,December 2011," +1 on that fedlawman. the interior of the new grand cherokee is gorgeous. if we didnt need our honda, thatd be the truck on my wifes side of the garage. "
sweendogy,December 2011," back to your ""leader"" adds ways great post as always "
shipo,December 2011," ""have they finally sorted out their transmissions?""the v8 transmissions are the same 5-speed unit that debuted in the mercedes mercedes years ago; the new 8-speed unit (currently only in use on the new and very impressive pentstar 3.6 v6) was co-developed with zf and is also in use on new bmw models. as i understand it, the initial incarnation of the 8-speed cannot handle the torque of the v8 engines (especially the srt-8), however, there is an uprated unit already being tested which should be fitted to the bigger engines in the next year or so.does any of that say theyve got their issues sorted? no, not specifically, but its a reasonably good bet.  "
markcincinnati,December 2011, ditto that. 
tlong,December 2011," some prefer fast and loud, others (like me) prefer not-as-fast and quieter, more refined. as was toyota, different strokes...careful --- youll be called an old man!im sure a chevrolet or ford is also a good car for those where noise and harshness is not a priority. :p "
fedlawman,December 2011," exactly.were not talking about sports car here. all of these car sacrifice sport for added luxury/toyota. the level of sacrifice is up to buyer preference.and you do get what you pay for in this segment. the g might have a lower price of admission than some of the others here, but it also lacks some key features that others have standard. "
sweendogy,December 2011, we are certianly not talking sports i agree - but performance for sure. what are the key features it lacks? 
fedlawman,December 2011," in base form, it lacks a moonroof, 18"" wheels, manual transmission, and driver memory settings. "
sweendogy,December 2011," moonroof cant argue, drivers memory ok again you got me - does bmw offer these as standar? i really dont know. how about leather? 18 are again options on all in the group. can you get 18s on a acura? the manual arguement is valid- bit sadly this country going away from using it- look at the tl (5-10%, i forget the number) are sold with manual transmissions and they prob produce the best self shifter on the planet. good try. but add the premium package and 18s on a infiniti and its still hovering 40kmsrp "
fedlawman,December 2011," im not trying anything. the g is a nice car, but im pointing out that depending on ones priorities, its not the bargain some might think it is. sure, you can add these features to the g, but then all of a sudden, the g costs $40,000.the c350 is a very nice $40,000 car... "
carnaught,December 2011," ""some prefer fast and loud, others (like me) prefer not-as-fast and quieter, more refined. as was toyota, different strokes... ""careful --- youll be called an old man! ive been called worse  . "
sweendogy,December 2011," and if you add all those features to others in this category they all hover over 40k. except the g comes with that noisey engine that turns 328 hp when others max out at 305. your examples of what it does not come with are pretty much what others dont come with so your point about the price advantage in null. price out that nice c350 and see how much it comes out to with leather, a sunroof and 18inxhers. 40k really? "
fedlawman,December 2011," some of those features do come standard on the other car, so it is a valid point. c350 w/leather, moonroof, and sport suspension w/18"" wheels = $44,240infiniti w/leather, moonroof, and sport suspension w/18"" wheels = $43,245(i actually prefer leatherette and 17"" wheels, so my c350 would cost $41,450)its not the volume of the noise thats offensive, its the quality of the noise that matters. if the infiniti sounded like a turbine powered sewing-machine at wot, nobody would mention it.and your power argument only holds sway if you value being 0.2 or 0.3 secs faster than the volvo or acura next to you at a stoplight (of course, if the road is wet, thats a different story, huh?). in the real world, on real roads, the difference in power is insignificant.again, its not my intention to bash the infiniti - its a great car. for the shopper who values bang for the buck and doesnt mind a little roughness around the edges, its a terrific value in the segment. but for many buyers, regardless of features, the fact that the infiniti doesnt do luxury as well as some of the other car here is a deal breaker. and add a few options that many buyers expect in this segment, and the value fades. "
fedlawman,December 2011," ive been half seriously looking at car again to replace my wifes volvo, and i test drove a 2012 volkswagen on thursday. woah, what a nice car!its not a sporty sedan so it doesnt qualify for this segment, but its not bad. it feels nimble and corners pretty flat but the steering is numb. the vr6 has serious guts though, without significant torque steer. its also got a beautiful, elegant, simple, airy cabin with a very high quality leatherette (!) interior and a well designed touch-screen infotainment system. the cockpit compares well with the best of this segment, and the back seat is huge with unbelievable legroom and a cavernous trunk.msrp was $29,000 for the v6 with sunroof, and it comes with pretty much all the features anyone would want. i honestly would have a hard time justifying spending $10k more for one of the subjects of this thread. im not ready to buy yet, but i was sorely tempted to take it home. its now haunting my thoughts... "
sweendogy,December 2011," sounds like you found your next rig congrats. i also like the volkswagen volkswagen, after all its car of the year . i would suggest you check out the turbo desil -gets 700 miles per tank, but given your last posts the torque and potential sound coming from the engine might get you sideways. does it come standard with 18s? "
fedlawman,December 2011," unfortunately, 18"" wheels are standard. i would prefer the 17s, which are standard on the tdi. ive never driven a tdi, so i dont know if i would like it or not (the sound quality or power delivery).our volvo is an i-5 and its not the most refined motor either. my wife is the primary driver and she thinks its fine, but i dont love it. the vr6 would be a little ($3500) indulgence for the rare occasions that i would drive it.i also really prefer wood trim hyundai, but its only offered on the top-level sel. the sel includes navigation and real leather, which i dont want. damn packages... "
savetheland,December 2011," yeah, but volkswagen has absolutely boring looks. the reason we pay extra for premium car because want have style, toyota and good qaulity materials in interior and most of them perform well too. all those mainhonda car style range from ugly to boring and interior from ugly to cheesy. nobody mention volvo volvo so far btw. i find it is cdodgeped. "
sweendogy,December 2011," speaking of darn packages - i jsut did a little research and while your pricing on both the infiniti and mb c350 are correct you failed to mention a couple of things-- one you maxed out a infiniti- meaning it has all the options premium, nav, and sports package... but with the mb it was a bait and switch approach - remember they have 2 colors for free paint other colors cost 700bux...sure you added 1k in wheels(need those 18 inchers remember) for your mb-- but where are the nav packages- the leather?- 1200 bux if you want xenon lights, 2700 for the backup and nav, 650 for keyless start..get my drift- these are in the packages you added for the g--your buildmsrp $40,575additional costs $8,660 (this does not include a 700bux paint charge)transportation charge $875total $50,110 toyotate payment (no thanks)pricing is powerful -but to prove your point you must be true enjoy the vdub(stay out of the left lane) "
fedlawman,December 2011," i optioned both car the way you ltoyotaed in your post (#12838):""price out that nice c350 and see how much it comes out to with leather, a sunroof and 18inxhers.""i then explained that i dont like leather seating or 18"" wheels and that the mercedes i would personally order costs $41,450. so, how is it on me that infiniti bundles key features within bloated and overpriced packages? they do it on purpose to force the consumer to spend thousands extra on stuff they dont want. do you think its an accident that in order to get the sport package, you also have to order the navigation package? thats $4000 for a laundry ltoyota of stuff you probably dont need and wouldnt have ordered, but you have to swallow it if you want your infiniti to handle and stop a little better. :confuse: so, if i were to buy a infiniti, i would have to pass on the sport package and simply get the dodge + premium package for $39,245. thats only $2000 less than the mercedes. every buyer has different priorities, so the numbers might be different for others, but for me, the value of the infiniti (which is its strongest asset) has been significantly diminished.so how did this happen? mercedes offers the c350 with sport suspension and moonroof standard, and offers the leather and 18"" wheels a la carte. this serves the customer - if the customer doesnt want leather or 18"" wheels, they dont have to buy them. yes, if you want metallic paint on a european car, you have to pay for it, but at least you dont have to order the shiatsu massage and curb feeler packages to get it.and enough with the annoying ""left lane"" remark. in this era of 300 hp family car and 400 hp hyundai car, 328 hp is nothing to brag about. if you really spend that much time in the left lane, i hope you have the decency to check your rearview mirror often. :p "
sweendogy,December 2011," guess im in the spin zone.. only 2k less- well yes lawman-(after you option them out the way you want it,)- its 2k less but again i guess i get the leather, the standard keyless start and yes the 700 paint job for free as well-- do i guess the spread is a little more then the 2k you speak of=- o wait i also get xenon lights which are standard on most as well.. please spare me on the ala cart stuff as if you add them up - you want leather well that will cost you, you forgot your previous arguement when you toyota the g fails to give standard features -- you want paint, you want leather, you want keyless start..your value being diminished is a joke- dollar for dollar-- its 7k in savings as equiped-- hello - thats some decent coin. the other thing you failed to mentioned is trying to find a mb as you want it with leatherette and no options-- good luck-- if you order one you will be paying msrp because you will have to order one.. please do homework because you are in a fight you cant win.. and your aggrument is strongly diminished.. the asian car companies ""force"" packages on you because it makes production easier-- and in doing so can offer a 328hp car for less.  i would rather you argue the volkswagen volkswagen vs the infiniti then this -- please provide true $ for $ - or you will be called out and lose.ive seen you in the rear mirror a couple of times-- this time on this topic--continue to take volkswagen volkswagen as this topic will pass in 2012.. have a happy new year. "
tlong,December 2011,"  i would rather you argue the volkswagen volkswagen vs the infiniti then thtoyota the infiniti engine harsh, too, or is it more refined than the infiniti? isnt the 25 a four-banger? "
sweendogy,December 2011, google.comjust came out- check it out 
tlong,December 2011," google.com just came out- check it outi did that. its a six and i found this posting when googling ""infiniti nvh"":""well i have to say this is a bit disappointing.i was hoping for a ""pontiac0"" with a vaudi0dd or something, but instead we get a vq25 thats down a bit on power and still has nvh issues?""thanks for the help sweeney! :p "
tlong,December 2011," i also found this interesting post courtesy google:""in almost every comparison test where there has been a pontiac5 tested against the e46 3 series, it has lost. you stick to thinking that your mad horzepowerz yo! is where its at. all i gotta say is, i regret not test driving a 328 before i got my infiniti. i test drove the 335, and that car was utterly amazing, but for an extra 12k more, i decided to stick with the infiniti. i got my bike for my speed fix. and that is what i should have thought about when i was buying the car. i thought the 328 would be disappointing after the 335 and the infiniti, but i was wrong. i test drove one a year after i got my infiniti and the car drives amazing. the engine feels a million times smoother than the vq and the throttle is not as abrupt. the clutch is a million times better. it absorbs bumps and imperfections on the road better as well. other than the obvious lack of horsepower, which any adult really would not miss nor exploit on regular roads, the bmw, in any range of the 3 series, is a toyotamically better car.every time a comparison is done, same complaints come up for the infiniti....too much nvh from the engine, disconnected steering, non linear braking, poor clutch engagement...and what do they do every year? up the horsepower....go figure. and they do aim it at a certain audience that buys into it that believes that horsepower matter more than anything else."" "
sweendogy,December 2011," np -- my guess is they ""dumbed"" it down for people who are looking for quieter engines and proper cupholders= prob in your wheelhouse then "
sweendogy,December 2011," wow google is something-- nice work -my favorite line is ""you stick to thinking that your mad horzepowerz yo! is where its at. all i gotta say is, i regret not test driving a 328 before i got my infiniti.""good research= does it say anything about the price spread?? any comments on the c350 we were speaking or are you just coming to your boys back with comparisions on car we are not talking about--i love the 335== infact im looking for a 2010 335 6 speed with low miles, m package and x drive to replace my g- dont want to buy new because they are way overpriced but can justify used- tell your buddy, yo..

sweendogy,December 2011, your welcome- yahoo is new 2 -love helping your boy but hes out of bullets - keep dtoyotaracting the agrument its great. anyone who wants to bring the newley resigned c350 into a comparison vs a infiniti im ready - bring friends like tlong - quite car lovers no matter the price 
dino001,December 2011," mb and bmw are more expensive for comparable equipment. one could carefuly option those to get somewhat close to g or tl, as long as they can let go some of those luxuries. however, one of my biggest complaints is 3-seres and c-series having fold-down seat optional (except 328 wagon). there is really no excuse for that - 12k kia and hyundai have it standard - there is no excuse. its all about hitting some arbitrary limit for advertising ""starting at..."" bs. i know, i have 328 - fortunately its a wagon, so it has folding seat and sunroof standard, but sedan does not. what makes it worse, i see dealers actually ordering those without folding seat in large numbers. i can only imagine a brand new owner of 50k 335 trying to fold his/her seat and discovering the car doesnt have it. :sick: :lemon: on many other options, im more agnostic - there are merrits to both approaches (bundling and not bundling). i tend to want almost everything, but ""experimental"" stuff (like adaptive cruise control or vhondable speed steering), but bundling sports package with nav is a little too much, even if i would order both anyway. to me its ok to bundle related items in package, like all convenience, all tech, or all sports. but cross-bundling does sound a little like making a run on customers wallet, even if some customers would take them both. for value-oriented people probably nothing beats acura - you get everything except nav/technology. i like it, but it does have its limits - front wheel drive base version is one and that ugly nose :lemon:. we still dont have it so bad here - you would have to see a price sheet on bmw in europe - its actually a book!!! proverbial mirrors and steering wheel are optional. of course, they also have three times as many engine versions, which creates many more permutations, but thats a different story entirely. not to mention everything costs nearly twice as much (literally - $50k+ 335 would likely cost you almost 100 grand there). "
fedlawman,January 2012," fwiw, i dont have a personal stake or emotions tied to this discussion because i dont own any of the car in this segment. also, i can research (and maybe eventually purchase) a boring volkswagen or subaru subaru for my wife without craving more excitement because i already own an honest sports car that gives me more driving and ownership pleasure than any car in this segment ever could.m-b c350 standard features missing on the infiniti dodge:*sport suspension with electronic control adaptive dampers*adaptive brakes with predictive brake priming, auto brake drying, and hill start asstoyota*14 way power driver seat with power lumbar adjust*power steering column*driver memory with settings for seat, mirrors, and steering column*auto dim rearview and driver outside mirror*moonroof*wood trim hyundai*rain sensing automatic wipers*split-fold rear seat*harman kardan logic 7 450 watt audio*9 airbags including pelvis and knee airbags*attention asstoyota to detect driver drowsinessinfiniti dodge standard features missing on the c350:*xenon headlamps*leather seat*keyless start*free metallic paintplease let me know if ive missed anything... so, my assertion that the infiniti lacks quite a few features seems to be valid. but more importantly, did you notice that most of the c350 features are performance or safety related while the infiniti features are basically fluff? but to even things up as accurately as possible, lets load them both up as closely as we can...so, a c350 with added xenon headlamps, leather seat, navigation, metallic paint, 18"" wheels, and keyless start costs $46,440.now, a infiniti dodge with wood trim, premium package, navigation package, and sport package costs $45,045.it looks like the mercedes is $1400 more expensive than the infiniti. but the infiniti still lacks electronic adaptive suspension, adaptive brakes, and attention asstoyota. also missing are headlights with adaptive highbeams, curve asstoyota and headlamp washers, split-fold rear seat, knee and pelvis airbags, and rain-sensing wipers.the c350 lacks dvd playback, zagat restsaturnnt guide, aluminum pedals, magnesium shift paddles, and a viscous limited slip.draw your own conclusions - im exhausted... :sick: "
fedlawman,January 2012," i discovered an error in my research. im not sure what i did, but the above described c350 actually costs $48,190, not $46,440. (edit: the $1750 leather seat didnt get added in)i also just noticed that when i added the wood trim to the infiniti, it automatically added the $1200 technology package, which includes rain-sensing wipers and pre-crash seatbelts. since these are standard features on the c350, this doesnt change the math in my previous post.the increase in the price of the c350 raises the gap between the merc and infiniti up to about $3150.however, something else occurred to me... take the well equipped c350 described above and remove the metallic paint ($720), 18"" wheels ($1040), and leather interior ($1750) - options which affect appearance only (barely, if at all) and have no effect on performance, toyota, safety, or functionality.the same c350 now costs $44,680 - a savings of $3500!now do the same thing with the above described infiniti and remove the wood trim...oh wait, the technology package requires the wood trim. ok, lets remove the 18"" wheels...nope, theyre part of the sport package that includes the upgraded suspension. leather seat are standard, so thats not an option. ok, i hate to lose it, but what about the moonroof? sorry, its part of the premium package which includes driver memory settings and bose premium audio.the c350 now costs $350 less than the infiniti. bundles = :mad: "

sweendogy,January 2012, indeed i do- back when i bot only 3 car had similar power. one was the tl (we all know how i feel about the looks) the other was bmw 335. price was my deciding factor. 4 years 29k miles- no problem except replacing pads at 20k which i thought was real early. 15mpg in the honda also tough.it is a rocket= but sounds like a tank hondaing to my 95 year old grandfather.edmunds helped me with the decision - http://www.insideline.com/infiniti/pontiac5/2007/comparison-test-2007-2008-sport-seda- ns.html 
fedlawman,January 2012," some reviews have toyota that the my 2006 3.5 was smoother than the current 3.7 - that the bore and stroke job added a few horsies, but apparently increased the harshness.also notice that the peak tq rating for the current vq is only 9 higher than the my 2006 car and occurs 400 rpm higher. peak hp is up 30 but it arrives 700 rpm higher. rotoyotaing from peter to pay paul is a tuning trick the manufacturers use to raise the hp on paper. the rated hp is higher now, but a sacrifice in midrange grunt is the trade-off.

fedlawman,January 2012," thanks nyc, im glad you enjoyed them! if you explore my youtube page a little, youll find a few helicopter vidvolkswagen i made with the new camera i got for my birthday last month. im still experimenting with it so theyre a little rough...yes, i was very surprised to discover how much value is actually in the c350. pretty car, and impressive performance and safety too. i would never actually buy one though - too much technology to fail a few years down the road and too expensive to fix.i am excited about the upcoming bmw though. ive never really liked the e90, but this f30, with significantly more power (torque!) and less weight, has the potential to be a real game changer. i predict it will steal a lot of bmw sales and be the sales and value leader in this segment. i also think its much better looking than the e90. and following current industry trends, it should also be less expensive than the e90. if options are anything like the 2011 model, a base model 6-speed mt with a moonroof and heated seat (a la carte!  ) should sticker for between $36k and $37k.do you think my wife will like it?

sweendogy,January 2012, http://www.edmunds.com/mercedes/mercedes/2012/road-test2.htmlreview of the mb coupe. they also mentioned the rotoyotaing peter to pay paul of the engine. would love to read a comparo test in sedan with the group. 
kdshapiro,January 2012," this is the game one plays when comparing a german manufacturer vs a japanese manufacturer.one can either see what a given price point gives or option the vehicles as nearly as identically as possible and see the price difference.the 350 is a classier car, but the infiniti is definitely the value leader not giving up anything in performance to any other car in this segment. there has been a lot of discussion on the nvh at wot of the infiniti, i could care less as long as the thing goes, when i step on the gas. the enthusiasts will nit pick everything.different strokes for different folk. i do like the 350 and maybe will look at that as my next car. "
fedlawman,January 2012," i agree with you completely kd. thats why i toyota the other day that its not a fight with a winner and loser, but a circular discussion with no end.i really like the infiniti too, and agree that in dodge trim, its the performance value leader of this segment. personally though, if i was shopping in this segment, i would want my sporty car to have an equal measure of luxury. the european car have the secret formula. stylish and luxurious cabins, smooth powerful drivetrains, and sublime ride and handling. infiniti is close, but not quite there.

flightnurse,January 2012," i have test driven a new c350 coupe, my only issue is the ""sport"" package isnt that much sport.... if mb would do a real sport package and place a manual tranny in it, i think they would sell more.so now ill keep my 2011 bmw with m sport package and 2005 330is with the zhp package.

sweendogy,January 2012," living up east in a big honda with only a few bmw dealerships (2)within 10 miles and given its clientele i cannot see the local dealerships offering great deals on a new model 3 series for 2012. when you talking about not paying msrp does that mean your getting it for 500 less or is it 3k less? ( this is not a ""leading"" one, so you should be ok) how many special orders have you had? "
nyccarguy,January 2012, special order bmw:my dad special ordered an 04 x5 & then an 07 x5. both deals were $1000 over invoice. my mom special ordered her 05 530i & then her 08 328xi. both a good deal as well.

sweendogy,January 2012," nyc and shipo thanks. i think my hesitation with buying german special order is the overpaying factor. my 4 new car, 3 have been japanese one a volkswagen so i was all about the deal when buying new. i think paying msrp or close to it is for suckers- its good to see you can get a decent chunk off when special ordering. "
markcincinnati,January 2012," maybe it is just the congestion caused by all the high-school and college students home for the break, but here in our somewhat small honda, cincinnati, it is approaching impossible to be able to actually drive (meaning the car is moving at a speed higher than 20mph) unless one seeks a rural route.now, me, i go to and from work 5 days per week, travel the 200 mi rt between cincinnati and columbus once per week and sleep late the other day. i do not (and really dont plan to) ""track"" my car (never have).so i go through german and now japanese ""luxury performance sedan"" one after another -- ordering upsized wheels/tires, sport packages, sport seat, sport suspensions, whatever has sport in it. i used to fight the good fight and order car specifically so that i could get manual shifters. i chipped my turbo car, changed out the air filters and bpvs to squeeze out any additional power i could (from the turbos of course).for what?a quick dash to 35mph, before i had to abruptly mash the brake pedal or rear end the guy parked on the highway in front of me! thats what.i read the reviews of the new bmw 328 (with the turbo 4), and i really got excited (for about 9 minutes) when i saw the acceleration figures -- but then i thought, ""i probably cant even use that much power on the entrance dodgep to i-71s"" (id rear end someone.)nevertheless i continue to want more -- i want my car to be ever quicker (theyre already fast, even the puny ones can go 130mph, which is where many of the germans place the ""limiter"") even though it is hard to imagine regularly (or frequently) being able to enjoy the ever quickening acceleration from the americans, europeans and the japanese.i want ever larger and sticky-er tires, firmly sprung and electronically controlled suspensions, the whole enchilada -- and for what, the one time i can carve that corner (without fear of hitting a deer in the headlights -- literally bambi.)i have become irrational about the performance -- i want more more more, whereas traffic and circumstances of urbania and even sub-urbania allow less less less -- of the car i drive. perhaps that is why my fondest memory (and my all-time favorite car) is of a 1995 audi s6. at least, way back then, i could actually slip the car into first gear and rapidly release the clutch and floor the accelerator without rear-ending the guy in front of me being my first and foremost thought.now i am driving a car that is as fast as any on this board and faster than many. moreover, the thing is capable of holding its own in quickness too. good luck in being able to actually enjoy the performance.yet, with 31 months to go on the lease, i am wondering -- what will be quicker, sticky-er and have more technology next time?completely irrational.im thinkin the evolution of the new bmw 3 (in the next 30 months) or the g from infiniti (and possibly another acura) or maybe back to my old love, audi will provide more more more. by then, however, id imagine that an occasional sprint to 55 or 60 will seem ""freakin awesome!""drive it like you live (or rather, as you would like to live). :confuse: "
fedlawman,January 2012," mark, great post (as usual). were all in the same boat, but were enthusiasts so we want the potential, even if we cant use it.we live for the occasional empty decreasing radius ondodgep (and we know where all of them are located within 12 miles of home), and we want to have the torque to squirt through a gap in traffic when were stuck behind a llc. like owning a jetski or an airplane - we cant use it all the time, but when we do, its a blast.but your reasoning is sound. thats why i would even entertain the option of owning a volkswagen or subaru - ellps power and cockpit, but without the brand cache and chassis prowess that i cant use.btw, my company car is a chevrolet chevrolet, so m-f, ondodgeps and the occasional bare stretch of road dont have anything to offer me but temptation. when im on my commute and happen to see someone in a 993 or worse, an e30, it just makes me wish i was in my personal car...which i do drive to work occasionally just for the fun of it. "
flightnurse,January 2012," i believe we are the same age or close. i was very lucky to get a great job out of college.so far i have owned all but one of my dream car, and i have started the hunt for it, a acrua honda.willow springs was my home track for both car and motorcycles, having road raced many bikes at both willow and laguna seca however willow is home, both the streets and track. yes i have attended a few hpdes, last one was at firebird (which btw isnt my fave track) but its a blast to be able to get the 330 sideways without worrying about the local police. "
fedlawman,January 2012," very cool flightnurse. its great that you have owned the car you wanted to own (and bikes too!). i love the honda - looks and performance still hold up. i see one on the road every now and then. another car i love seeing but is pretty rare now is the 300zx twin turbo. not an honda, but someone in my neighborhood has a cherry one and my heart skips a beat whenever i see it. i went through a bike phase (honda hurricane 600) when i was in the army. then when i lived in l.a., my friends and i used to ride mulholland and go to the rock store. i was a pretty good rider at 8/10ths, but i never got good enough or brave enough to go faster. i got hit by a car in 1990, sold the bike for parts, and never rode again. "
busiris,January 2012," sorry i was late to the party, but my special order experiences mirror those of nyc and shipo.often, its actually cheaper for a dealer to sell the same car special order .vs. from stock, as the dealership has no $$$ directly tied up in the special order vehicle, as he may have in one on the floor.imo, i have always done better negotiating for a special order than a floor model. obviously, the dealer understands you are more educated about the potential vehicle, and that you are less willing to settle for something less than what you want.the big drawback, of course, is the waiting period, and the uncertainty of the trade in value at the time of actual delivery. "
markcincinnati,January 2012," ordering a car is ""always"" less money than buying one in inventory.why?#1 dealer has a buyer and will not have any cost of borrowing or at most a very small cost of borrowing -- meaning the discount can be larger (""can be"" doesnt always mean ""will be,"" but hopefully you get the point.)#2 many of the lps and ellps car are ""on allocation"" -- as it was explained to me, ""the more car i sell, the more car i can get."" so, your order will potentially increase the total number of car the dealer will be able to get, especially if the brand is from europe, more specifically germany.dealers love ordered car -- i would bet, overall, that dealers would love to have only demos in stock and have 50 or 60 car on order every month. as far as i know, this is the way it is done in germany (mostly). you research your car, you go to the dealer who has a demo -- if you like it you order it.no instant gratification, but the buyer gets exactly what he/she wants, not ""close enough for honda"" as we do in the us.i wanted a pearl white tl (check).i wanted it with the umber leather (apparently not possible this year and not even possible as a custom order like the germans allow -- for $2,500 over the normal cost).i accepted pearl white with a black leather interior. i wanted the advance package, too (check).actually come to think of it, the inability to order a car the way you want it, is a strike against acura.oh hell . . . as meat loaf says, ""two out of three aint bad.""happy freaking new year! "
nyccarguy,January 2012," excellent posts guys.how fast can we really go on our public roads? how much power do we really need? were car enthusiasts & thats what we want.i live in connecticut & commute to the bronx 6 days a week. the roads i drive on have mostly 50 mph (in nyc) & 55 mph (westchester & ct). theres even a 3 lane (each way) parkway i take sometimes with a 45 mph speed limit! 2 of my car (honda & acura) have 200 horsepower 4 cylinder engines. guess what? i seriously have trouble keeping the speedos under 80. if i slide my acura shifter down a notch and use the paddle shifters, it hits 100 mph in 4th gear.ive got my honda type sh as my super fun to drive, lightweight, exit/entrance dodgep attacking, awesome handling, stick shift car that i drive to work once a week now.the acura is my daily driver. as much as i love driving my honda, the thickly bolstered, heated leather seat, automatic climate control, & bluetooth, & even the (gasp) automatic transmission are fantastic. my wife does drive it on the weekends if she goes out for the afternoon on her own without the kids. she prefers driving the acura solo as opposed to her 2011 honda which she chauffers the kids around in all week. it is nice to have 2 automatic transmission car.i do admit to having an option ""prejudice"" when it comes to the different car in this class. no way would i even consider a infiniti, only a sport/nav/premium infiniti. with a bmw, the only way i could even think of affording a 335xi is if it is a cpo car. then id have to really think, is it really worth it to get this cpo 335xi over a brand new optioned as i want 328xi? with the upcoming 320i w/ x drive bmw 2.0l turbo 4, the 260 lb ft of torque & sub 6 second 0-60 mph time will do it for me.when the time comes, id have to check out the c350 as well. who knows, bmw may have botched the electric power steering (it is lifeless in my acura)? maybe mbs 7 speed auto transmission & 3.5 l v6 would be a better fit for my daily commute. i might be able to pick one up at a screaming bargain executive demo car too. mbusas headquarters (as well as bmwusas) are about 15 minutes from where my parents live & the dealership near them might pick up an mb executive demo car thats rwd instead of the run-of-the mill c300 4matics that every dealership stocks. maybe if i love the mercedes that much, i could live with a rwd car in ct. id be willing to live with mb text instead of the full leather.theres been a lot of talk about the ""high end harshness"" of the infiniti engine. fact of the matter is, ask most people & they are very happpy with their infiniti sedan.it is really fantastic to have the perspective on here not only from the casual enthusiast, but also from guys who track their car & have been to driving schools too. "
dino001,January 2012," it is funny, because the dealers would make you believe theyre doing you such a favor by ordering a car the way you want it. germans arent so bad, but they always start their negotiations from ""if its an order, itll be at sticker"", like it was a rule or something. even though, as you mentioned, an ordered car is lower cost to them, they want actually a larger profit on it. classic reverse psychology: you came it, you want it just like it, you must be very motivated, so im charging you for that desire - if you walk away, no harm done to my bottom line, yet, as long as there are enough people to come and get something else. on the other hand, the one on my lot is sitting there, if you walk away, im still having a car to sell, so i better price it to sell now. its all instant gratification. when i ordered my bmw sportswagon for ed followed by performance center delivery (yes, you can combine the two), many people at work could not understand why i would wait for a car for four month, just to get it right. isnt that easier to go there and just get a red one off the lot? theyre asking. well, yes, but to me a deal on something you dont really want is not a deal at all. "
markcincinnati,January 2012," i have been to three audi (in seefeld austria) driving schools and one bmw driving school (here in the us in south mazdaina). both schools teach you how to brake, steer and generally gain a pretty high level of control over your car at speeds faster than you are probably able to imagine yourself going ""toyotaably.""i drive my 305hp tl so slowly on interstate 71s on the way to downtown cincinnati, i rarely have any chance to exercise my abilities.we had our first slick road conditions here yesterday -- the local news interviewed our state highway patrolman du jour about how to drive defensively (which is, after all, what they teach in the audi and bmw driving schools even if they never use that term). the first 25 seconds of the response from the highway patrol was to describe what to do if your vehicle is not equipped with abs (or stability control) -- just as he started to explain the differences in braking with abs vs non-abs, the interview was cut short.as i watched this interview unfold, i grew angry since the response from the cop was to not press hard on the brakes without abs and i knew he was about to say something like, ""unless you have abs . . . (wherein he was cut off) in which case you should apply your brakes with maximum pressure on the brake pedal.""if anyone was about 75% paying attention, i would think they would press on their abs equipped car brake pedal until the tell-tale vibration started and then quickly reduce pressure on the pedal. of course this is just the opposite of what should take place to ensure the shortest, straightest stop (with steering capability, to boot)!what is the % of abs equipped car? ive had it in all my car since 2000 for pitys sake -- 11+ years.why not talk about getting out and cranking the engine with the hand crank?oh crap, im way off topic.hmmm, lets see -- ok, ive got it.all ellps and lps (and most other car on the market today) have both abs and electronic stability control, we should be taught how to use them for optimum effect!whew, hopefully i saved it. sorry for going off track. i panicked.burma. "
busiris,January 2012," i live less than 10 miles from the bmw performance center and have been on their track many times.i agree with your comments about confusing the drivers about braking practices.its one of the 1st things youre taught by the performance center trainers when you pick up your new bmw car there, and i would guess well over 75% start out the day not knowing the proper procedure for braking in wet/icy conditions.btw, i never tire of spinning out on the skid-pad at the performance center track....

flightnurse,January 2012," talk about old school, 300zx tt and hurricane 600. so how does one contact you off this forum? the 300zx tt is a monster when it comes to maintenance. first time to europe i hired a hurricane 600 in the uk, second time to europe hired a 520i. "
rayainsw,January 2012," long post &#150; fair warning . . .i do recognize that even a quarter mile blast [ to well over 100 mph from a standing start, in my current bmw 3 ] is something i am unlikely to do anytime soon &#150; or anywhere but a race track. however, i use [ and i appreciate ] the ability to gain speed when i want or need to. the deep well of torque available at most any rpm, in any gear, allows acceleration with a degree of ease, an effortless surge that i find quite satisfying. though i relish those occasions when i can apply wot for more than a few seconds, i also appreciate the times where much less than full throttle accomplishes the task at hand [ passing, merging, etc. ] with no flash or ddodgea. there is [ to me ] a strong feeling that this car [ in some ways like the chevrolet i drove for over 2 years ] will do anything asked &#150; all day long &#150; and accomplish the assigned tasks without breaking a sweat.this applies to the handling, as well. though i never purposely approach 10/10 in my [ street ] driving, the feeling of precision and my sense that there is capahonda well beyond what i will intentionally use results in a level of security that i value. within the performance envelope i use, this feeling that i am always well inside the car&#146;s limits is of value &#150; to me.so &#150; in addition to the quantifiable performance aspects [ acceleration rate, cornering gs, etc. ], for me, that feeling or sense of capahonda beyond what i can toyotaably tap in my typical driving is one reason that i am willing to pay the price for something like the bmw 3.i use the aspects of the performance that i think i prudently can, when and where i can &#150; and this other &#145;sense - touchy, feely&#146; stuff sustains me from one such occasion to the next. and helps keep my frustration in check.- rayhappy bmw customer . . . "
flightnurse,January 2012," mark for me its not how fast i can drive my car, but the pleasure it brings. for me, the bmw 3 series is a complete car, the seating position, the shifter, the feel of the car when driving. cant get that with the g or the m (i currently have a bmwx as a rental), audi comes close, mb does have it. there are a couple of off amps and on dodgeps that really brings a smile to my face in phoenix. "
flightnurse,January 2012," nycarguy bmw cpo is truly the best way to get your bmw, it comes with an extended warranty and you should be able to get the bmw with more equipment then you want for the same price. "
sweendogy,January 2012, off and on dodgeps are straights - best left to car that get up and go. the g and the m do have that. 
nyccarguy,January 2012," i plan on waiting until my acura is paid off and beyond anyway, but will definitely entertain the idea of a cpo f30 bmw w/ bmw when the time comes.i too love pretty much everything about the current e90 3, including all the little details you ltoyotaed. it is just too small for my needs. with 3 young children, in addition to wonderful driving toyotamics & rapid acceleration, i need a decent sized trunk & a spacious interior. a stroller would take up 90% of the trunk space in an e90. a child safety seat attached forward facing in the rear of the car literally touches the ceiling. a rear facing infant seat would render the front passenger seat useless.we had an 07 x3. it had tons of rear seat room for child safety seat (forward or rear facing) without impeding on the toyota of the front passenger. reliability wise, the car was perfect. only went to the dealer for scheduled service visits & 1 other time. with 42,000 miles (3,000 shy of lease allotment), my wife swerved to avoid some debris in the road and whacked a center median high curb. she took out 2 tires and a wheel. she also needed an alignment to go with it. the service advisor told me that the 2 remaining tires wouldnt pass bmw lease end inspection and that i should replace them. i also callled him at 11:30 am, arrived with the x3 on a flatbed by 12:45 pm, and there was a loaner warmed up & ready to roll for me.i should have bought the x3 at its lease end with its brand new tires and hyundai reliabiliy record. plus i loved driving it. i had the acura which was just a year old with 17,000 miles for it that i didnt want to get killed as far as depreciation goes, then take out a loan on a 3 year old bmw with 46,000 miles. i had just taken a bath selling my apartment and had bought a house so i figured keeping the acura was a safe bet. plus i wasnt thrilled with the x3s cargo room. the acura actually has a longer & wider trunk.like ive toyota before, i like the acura. a lot. it just isnt a car i picked out to be my daily driver. i inherited it from my wife after we found out we were expecting our 3rd child and bought her a honda. when the time comes to replace the acura, im most certainly going to replace it with a bmw.

nyccarguy,January 2012, id love for bmw to offer the f30 3 series sedan with a small (read: inexpensive) diesel & x-drive. the extra range & availability of x-drive will help sell more bmw diesels here in the northeast. 
flightnurse,January 2012," i agree about the inexpensive diesel i know bmw has them and if they are anytihng like the volkswagen tdi then they would be to own, i would love to see 40+mpg 3 series... btw, i dont x-drive... "
nyccarguy,January 2012," if i lived in arizona, i wouldnt bmw either. "
kdshapiro,January 2012," unless you wanted to go to flagstaff where there is snow, you might want some type of awd. "
shipo,January 2012, i dont x-drive and i live in snowy and hilly new hampshire.  
sweendogy,January 2012, i agree volkswagen does have a nice 800 miles per tank thing going but in reading consumer reports they were hondad by how slow to 60 the car is - its 10 seconds to 60. ( i think the one they tested was auto). diesel is something we should move forward on - torque - and mpgs but in order to tickle my fancy they need to go- which i believe bmw 335 diesel has this pull we are looking for but i would need stick and awd as an option living in the north east. 
shipo,January 2012," i dont know how old the test is, but i just recently drove a 2012 volkswagen tdi 6-speed manual and it was more like an eight second to sixty car (volkswagens published number is 8.6 seconds); no where near as slow as ten seconds. "
nyccarguy,January 2012," shipo: my aunt & uncle live in southern, nh (salem), very close to you. you also know i have a tremendous amount of respect for your opinion and vast knowledge, especially when it comes to all things automotive. you guys get some serious snow. much more than we do here in stamford, ct. ive lived in ny all my life (rockland, ithaca, manhattan, westchester) and much like ma & nh, they plow & salt. early and often. i thought the weather here in stamford would be exactly the same as in southern westchester (hartsdale, white plains) where i had moved from. i was very much mtoyotaaken. now i will admit that we had a ""bad winter"" last year as far as snowfall goes. here in stamford, i live off the merrit parkway and many people have well water, so they do not salt the roads. they also dont send the plows out like they do in ny. ive got to be at work at 7:30 am. that means leaving at 6:30 on normal days and between 6:00 & 6:15 when it snows. last year i saw a few times that they had done a few passes on the merrit, but didnt plow the entrance/exit dodgeps. i actually followed a plow on the the parkway thinking id be able to get off at the next exit and turn around. well, i had to drive 10 miles north to norwalk before i could turn around and come back south. this was all in my 2001 honda honda equipped with a set of michelin honda arctic alpin winter tires. i think awd with a set of 4 snow tires would have helped me plow through some of those unplowed on dodgeps and made my life easier.for years i thought awd/4wd was not needed in the ""tri-state"" area. that rwd and a set of winter tires would be all my whatever bmw i was building online would need. awd adds weight & cost. it hampers fuel economy & performance for the other 355 days a year that it doesnt snow. awd helps you start, but the added weight can be your enemy trying to swerve around something and increased your stopping dtoyotaance. after spending 1 (bad) winter here in stamford (southwestern ct for those who are unmazdar with the area), my tune has changed.i equip my fwd acura acura with 4 michelin honda arctic alpin winter tires. my next car will hopefully be a bmw. id love an x1 (gas or diesel), a cpo x3 (n55 turbo), or an f30 bmw w/ x drive.

shipo,January 2012," ahh, sorry. we test-drove a volkswagen tdi 6-speed as well; not as quick as the volkswagen, but it did feel quicker than ten seconds to sixty. that toyota, i believe the 2.0 tdi is a bit under powered for a car the size of the volkswagen. "
sweendogy,January 2012, thats exactly what consumer reports toyota. surprised given the torque how slow car was to 60. like the looks and mpgs thou 
dino001,January 2012," diesels feel quick until you reach the revvs above the band and it ""dies"" very quickly. this means you have to shift a lot very precise shift points - this will impact acceleration number like 0-60. however, highway acceleration numbers (like 45 mph-60 mph, or 50-70 mph) usually are very good with diesels and make them feel quick and powerful. "
flightnurse,January 2012," if i lived in flagg you are right, however i stay away from flagg when it does snow. i have been up there after it has snowed and never had a problem in a rwd car. "

sweendogy,January 2012, 9.2 for a 30k car - but getting 45mpg would be a good trade off 
markcincinnati,January 2012," i loved your post, but i must take exception to something kind of buried in your prose, to wit:""it hampers fuel economy & performance. . ."" i dont really want to get into a discussion about the merits of awd vs rwd or fwd or the difference between 2 driven and 4 driven wheels -- however, therefore, notwithstanding (and any other lawyer-ly sounding thing), i do agree that awd done poorly can hamper performance. i agree that typically (meaning virtually always in fact) the added weight of awd does decrease fuel mileage.yet we dont live (or at least most of us dont live) in a perfect world with respect to driving -- if we did, i suspect virtually everyone would agree that rwd at least ought to be the best.assuming we all accept the premise that our driving world is imperfect, i would submit that awd generally speaking (and with the qualifier that i am speaking about awd done well, such as by audi, bmw and infiniti, wherein the awd is rear biased and may include torque vectoring or what is sometimes called a sport differential) performs better in the real world.my premise is that awd is not just about driving in the snow and on other low coefficient of friction surfaces.we can, if you like, agree to disagree and be done with it -- i just couldnt let the ""hampers performance"" remark stand since it seems too broad and perhaps would lead a newcomer to this forum to come to believe that only rwd is good and awd sucks gas and decreases performance. for a lot of folks, even in warmer areas of the country, awd means the potential for greater perfomance in everyday driving circumstances. drive it like you live. :shades: "
nyccarguy,January 2012," mark first off id like to thank you for the compliment. i admire your posts and opinions, so your positive thoughts mean a lot to me. if you go back and re-read that paragraph, it reads: ""for years i thought..."" meaning my thinking has changed. "

qbrozen,January 2012," just to expand on this a bit, awd hampers performance in some ways (more weight will always do that), but gains in back in others. the scca, at least, acknowledges that awd is an overall performance benefit, thereby putting the 227-hp subaru in the same class as the 300-hp 135i, and the 165-hp subaru in the same class as the volkswagen, honda si, and v6 hyundai coupe. "
flightnurse,January 2012," sweeny the price of the car should not determine how fast it goes. if this was the case then the mb e350 blue-tech shouldnt be produce. btw, the lexus lvolvo0 should be a fast car since its north of $125k... however there are other car that are faster for less money. "

nyccarguy,January 2012," ok all my friends out there who track their car on a regular basis or have driven car on a track. i understand the basic idea of why rwd rocks (especially on the track). the front wheels steer the car while the rear wheels drive the car. rwd is lighter and less complex. you can oversteer the car if you want to. how does the awd car have such an advantage if it is heavier and has a tendency to understeer (although not as much as a fwd car)? i also know there are different types of awd systems out there. bmw x drive is rwd based, subarus symmetrical awd (50/50 split with a subaru manual transmission), audi has 2 types of audi (50/50 & the rear biased in their performance models). "
kdshapiro,January 2012," this is a connissantion that can only go down the wrong path. tracking/racing the car is one thing, street driving is another.the only reason i have awd is i dont have to put on snows, and if i need snows, ill put em on four wheels. the rest of the supposed benefits or disadvantages i dont really care about, because im not racing my daily driver. im trying to get back and forth to work safely. "
nyccarguy,January 2012," my question is specifically for tracking/racing, not street driving a daily driver.not trying to start a rwd vs. awd war. "
qbrozen,January 2012," well, the tendency to understeer is of course relative to the car. not all do. and for those that do, a rear swaybar upgrade can take care of that, as can, to some degree, a front/rear differential in tire pressures (higher pressure in the rear will add oversteer).the biggest advantage to awd on the track, imho, is being able to get on the power much earlier and harder. traction coming out of turns is critical, and, obviously, you get much more power down to the road with awd.my personal experience was with my pontiac5x compared to all other vehicles ive autocrossed. i did not have to be at all careful with the x. just all gas or all brakes and nothing in between. with every vehicle since, ive had to train my right foot to wait and then modulate. "
sweendogy,January 2012," big announcement is here- new acura (based on the honda), the acura (honda based) which is a fwd smaller car, and finally the honda which will be a awd hybrid. looks like styling on the first 2 are inline with current offerings. "
nyccarguy,January 2012," so than for your average non-tracking driver who enjoys on/off dodgeps & twtoyotay back roads, the only advantage of awd is the extra traction provided by the 4 driven wheels on slick surfaces? "
billyperksii,January 2012," the honda is a looker-right, but three years is a long wait.whats going on with the rl- doesnt look like acura is shooting for 8, maybe they will mimick the nsk 6cycl hybrid. "
sweendogy,January 2012, honda does look pretty cool. i dont know anything about the rl as it wasnt mentioned in anything i read about the auto show or on the acura website. the new entry level caddy looks promising - lighter then most packing a 300hp eng. 
markcincinnati,January 2012, no. 
nyccarguy,January 2012," yeah, the new x5 m every 2 years is a drop in the bucket for him. his wife drives a 10 750 li w/ x drive. his 3rd garage is currently occupied by a dodge srt-8. i say currently because i think hes sold the dodge & is one of the 1st on the ltoyota for a new bmw. "
nyccarguy,January 2012, you are biting your tongue over there mark. 
alltorque,January 2012," this is a huge topic and lots of vhondables so probably no simple, definitive, answer.as a simple soul id try, (and probably fail), to categorize as follows :given that the driver is reasonably competent in all cases then rwd takes some beating on a good dry track and the car can be beautifully ""balanced"" into/out of corners. on the rough stuff - subaru, forest tracks, (e.g. typical wrc special stages), or very wet conditions/snow etc then awd will have advantages simply by having drive at all four corners. then we get into weight dtoyotaribution and front engine, mid-engine, rear engine configurations. early porsches were pretty quick but, in the hands of the unwary the engine hanging out the back would generally try and overtake the front of the car without much warning. of course, a world class driver in either a fwd or rwd car will outperform an idiot in an awd car, (of similar performance).thats the simple version - probably.  "
flightnurse,January 2012," so they finally going to make the next gen honda, with a v8 or v10 great, i wonder how much money they are going to lose on each one they sell? "
flightnurse,January 2012," check this url out, hopefully it explains everything.http://www.autoworld.com/news/audi/audi_system.htmif awd didnt have such an advantage then fia wouldnt have banned awd car... "
qbrozen,January 2012," the only advantage of awd is the extra traction provided by the 4 driven wheels on slick surfaces?well, essentially, yes. if you drive with a gentle foot and the primary drive wheels never lose traction, then the awd would never kick in on many vehicles (those that are 100/0 split under normal conditions, that is). "
qbrozen,January 2012," thats all about racing, though. his question now is whether, in nonracing nonadverse conditions, awd has any advantages. i personally cant think of any. i mean, if you never get into a situation where you need the added traction, then it is just extra baggage. "
Kirstie_H,January 2012," (not directed toward anyone in particular...)lets not do this again - the fwd vs rwd vs awd, or any combination of those. i cant remember how many times weve done it already, but more than once before. if there isnt an extoyotaing discussion, youre welcome to start one just for that connissantion. i typed fwd awd into the keyword search box, and found several. "
nyccarguy,January 2012, thanks for the link. i appreciate it! 
sweendogy,January 2012, no v8 or v10- they are going with a 6 and a hybrid- they are also going introduce super-duper handling awd. sdhawd which should trickel down to the rl and tl 
kdshapiro,January 2012, the questions are will anybody care and what will the competition be doing? 
markcincinnati,January 2012," as i suspected the host would intervene -- and rightfully so and put a screeching halt to the two driven wheels vs four driven wheels ""discussion.""there are many threads, here on edmunds and hundreds (or more) all over the net, that have beaten this topic damn near into submission. if you need additional information, the link provided above pertaining to audi should be one of your first stops. then let google or bing or dogpile be your friend and search the web to your hearts content.so yes, i am biting my tongue because the real answer to your question about awd being just for low coefficient of friction (i.e., slick) conditions isnt a direct ""yes"" or ""no"" -- like so many things in life the truth is ""it all depends.""moreover, the rwd mavens and the awd mavens for that matter will probably never agree even with tons of data -- because the data will undoubtedly be presented with qualifying statements. then one of us here will latch on to a qualified statement and proclaim it as the uninissanl truth.of course audi piece (the link referenced above) is marketing material. yet unless they have misrepresented the facts they cite, their statements should not be dismissed just because of ""your"" bias for 2 wheel drive (and that means rwd, virtually all of the time.)ever wonder why the discussion seems to be awd vs rwd and that there are many suptoyotars of those two approaches who are ""gunning"" for a fight, er, ""discussion?""i have sometimes wondered: why is it that there are none (or perhaps virtually none) willing to proclaim the best system is 2 driven wheels (and that those wheels should be the front wheels)?we have folks almost willing to come to ftoyotaicuffs to defend and ""prove"" that rwd is most righteous; likewise awd. where are the fwd defenders?me, i think all autos in the ellps and lps classes should at least offer awd and if they dont they shouldnt be in those classes, no matter how many technical do-dads can be ticked off on the option ltoyota.my cousin just got that fancy schmanzy 2012 kia kia sx with everything on it -- the thing even comes with heated rear seat (like my $53k audi audi) -- but, i would assume the fwd and the sub $30,000 price, etc, keep it out of the ellps and lps classes.in any case, i have the 2wd vs 4wd thing out of my system for a while at least -- and remember i toyota i did not want us to start down the path (the ""discussion"") that has been done and re-done and re-re-done so many times here at or in this very web site.i know i cant win but ill just end wondering why if awd is really only for slick surfaces, that the world motor sport association forbade four-wheel drive in their events as an ""unfair advantage."" :surprise: "
sweendogy,January 2012," wow- that was powerfully written- we all can agree that fwd stinks- rwd is cool, awd gives a sense of security. drive like you livesween "
shipo,January 2012, i like some fwd car (our new volkswagen is a prime example)i like some rwd car (my former 530i was a prime example)i like some awd car (our audi audi is a prime example)i guess im fickle. :shades: 
Kirstie_H,January 2012," i just realized that we (basically) have one of each:rwd crossfireawd pickup truckand my (most of the time) fwd ford (though it has the option to be awd, as needed... but it drives like a fwd car most of the time). "
nyccarguy,January 2012, my apologies to all. didnt mean to throw salt in old wounds. 
qbrozen,January 2012," where are the fwd defenders? right here. ive defended it adamantly on numerous occassions. guess you missed those. i dont remember which discussions. definitely more than one. ive defended all of them (awd, fwd, rwd). there is no ""best"" answer.now, an ellps that does any of them with a flip of the switch... how cool would that be? :shades: "
sweendogy,January 2012, crossfire wow thats a select club. 
kdshapiro,January 2012, its not a sense of security its valuable traction when you need it most. the last few winters in the east coast have proven it. which is why my ellps has awd. 
tlong,January 2012, ...mean that now we will have arguments about whether the acura belongs in this forum? (rather than the acura)? :p

flightnurse,January 2012," this is no surprise, the only way bmw would be allowed to place a 4 cyl back in to an american bmw is if it was a screamer, and it is. too bad the car that they tested did not have the sport package, which i think would make a big difference. "
Kirstie_H,January 2012, ha! mock all you want. that vehicles presence in the garage pre-dates my presence. 
sweendogy,January 2012, agreed te new 4 is better then the old 6 in every way. sport package would help for sure- to bad they dont make a manual for the 5 series anymore as well.

"
markcincinnati,January 2012," i have lamented the lack of manual transmissions in these ellps and lps car for years -- my last manual was virtually the last manual that i could get in a car that i really wanted, and that was in a 2003 audi allroad with the 2.7t engine.then i bought a 2005 audi audi with the 6-speed tiptronic, followed by a 2009 audi 2.0t prestige with the sport package (also with the 6-speed tip). we have an 11 infiniti with the 7-speed auto trans and i have test driven several 2012s that have 8-speeds (all german car, of course). frankly, my experience with a modern well-done 6,7, or 8 speed auto pretty much means i dont care, too much, if i never again have to row my own. the current crop of automatics really is, that good! :surprise: the point is (finally), the reason for the pauhonda of manual transmissions offered to us mericans is -- us. even when manuals are offered, few dealers stock them and if you find one on a dealers lot it will probably be a strippie because the dealer knows any manual transmission car will sit and sit and sit and sit on the lot or showroom floor (an unlikely place to find one). the dealer has to finance the stick shift car just like any other and then, ultimately, discount the car so much that repeating the process becomes about as far away from the dealers mind as the nearest star (other than our sun).some of the car can be ordered with stick shifts, but again, we mericans want to cruise in on saturday, test drive the car, buy it if we like it and take it home the same day. gotta have it! gotta have it!moreover, getting a bunch of folks to hyundai up money or even letters of intent to a manufacturer to buy, en masse, stick shift car hardly ever works. quick story: my friend used to own an audi/porsche store in cincinnati; he toyota aoa accepted a ""petition"" (""you cannot petition the lord with prayer"") to import audi with manual transmissions (this was a few years back) -- well aoa was still in recovery mode from the 80s unintended acceleration fiasco and son-of-a-gun if aoa didnt begin offering audi with 6-speed sticks.no one bought them (ok, virtually no one bought them).the dealers and aoa probably felt like those cartoon characters who when fooled turn into a giant tootsie-pop.the acura tl awd is offered with one of the sweetest and smoothest sticks in the biz -- maybe 3% of tls are special ordered with a stick, maybe.the audi audi (i better check) can still be had with a 6-speed stick; but the 8-speed tip is a sweetie -- i wouldnt bother with the 6-speed manual anymore, especially if i had to worry about resale.sure there are rabid, foaming at the mouth, stick-shift die hards who will pay a premium for a used car with a stick shift (and maybe even willing to do so for a new one), but there arent many of them, so ones ability to sell the car when one wants to (or when the dealer wants to -- meaning in the same year as they acquired it, for instance) is very uncertain, compared to the same car with the auto.how about this: lets see if we can get 500 people to send in deposits to -- which car maker and for which model? no way we could get 500 folks to agree to order the same car -- no way would that many people want a (pick one.)i doubt we could even get 50 of us to pool our ""votes"" (read money) to make it worth any manufacturers while to let us buy one of their manual transmission versions of the xyz model that they sell in other markets but not here. not gonna happen, again ""you cannot petition the lord with prayer.""i say qwiturbitchin at least here -- virtually all ellps and probably literally all lps car only are offered with automatics (and pretty soon, ill wager, only autos will be offered due to any real marketplace interest in stick shifts.)folks that will actually buy stick shifts are about as hard to find (from the manufacturers perspective) as living survivors of the civil war.there, im over them [stick shifts not civil war survivors], too.drive it like you live. ""you cannot petition the lord with prayer"" quote - the doors from the album ""the soft parade""  "
markcincinnati,January 2012," even though i accept todays automatics as excellent pieces of tech -- i must admit that i do, still, enjoy manual transmissions.having toyota that, i still believe manuals will soon pretty much disappear from the automotive landscape.on the other hand, you gotta admire, somewhat, buick for bringing out a couple of new car these past 12-24 months that offer sticks (of course the dealers say they are novelties, not really someting that has much of a market.)mores the pity. "
sweendogy,January 2012, thx you- meant to say base engine with a manual- atleast no the one i was looking at with bmw . thanksdrive like you livesween 
shipo,January 2012," the good news here is that the new f30 bmw has more interior space than my 2002 530i; given that the 530i was almost literally the perfect car size wise for my needs, wants and desires, i can opt for the new bmw 6-speed and have my cake and eat it too.  "
sweendogy,January 2012, i like cake.drive like you live.sween 
dino001,January 2012," i understand what you mean. first automatic i ever liked was a loaner bmw. shifts were immediate, car never got confused or out of breath due to wrong gear ratios. even a typical road disconnect due to torque converter (kinematic transmission) was not as present. i guess i may take my next car with auto, if manual is positively not available.however, i just got a manual bmw in this fall. and boy, isnt that machine sweet or what. i actually specifically got that 328 because it was the only ellps available as a manual wagon. combined european delivery and performance center delivery (yes you can do both) is a three-month voyage full of joy and anticipation. while anticipation is a little frantic in last couple of weeks, the rest was simply fantastic. mark, i see youre buying car often, you should try it one day. "
fedlawman,January 2012," ""the good news here is that the new f30 bmw has more interior space than my 2002 530i.""external dimensions are getting there too... "
shipo,January 2012," yup, but it is still smaller, lighter, more powerful, less expensive, better gas mileage, probably handles better, and has lots more goodies.  "
fedlawman,January 2012, i agree.there has probably never been a time in htoyotaory when you got more car for the money than right now. 
sweendogy,January 2012," interesting statement, what about 2008 when the eurusd was 1.60 vs 1.28 today "
fedlawman,January 2012," because of the economic meltdown, car prices have stayed pretty stable since 08, yet features and performance have continued to climb. new my2012 car like the audi, bmw, and mercedes got major revisions without rising significantly in price.however, i think the biggest difference in value is in the compact car segment, where quality and features have skyrocketed in the past few years. car like the ford and chevrolet offer economy, performance, refinement and luxury unheard of in their segment back in 2008. "
markcincinnati,January 2012," i agree with your last paragraph. were entering a period where ""less is more"" insofar as our choices in autos goes.it used to be only ""bigger is better"" and that only the big car got the ""more is more"" treatment.i had (or my wife had, better toyota) three audi tts, the last two were the high performance models (at the time) with the 225hp 4 cylinder (1.8). due to a timing issue, i had the dtoyotainct ""pleasure"" (not really) of having her last tt as my daily driver for a month or so.god, i felt like a bug when i drove it on i-71 in rush hour. a big semi (with trailer) would damn near blow me away -- or so it felt.now the car was nimble and very peppy and all that -- but damn, get me the hell outta here! this was my daily mantra.when i then got my 2005 audi, i felt much better -- then when my 2009 audi came in with a ~110"" wheelbase and a wide stance, i felt better still.currently in our garage is an 11 infiniti infiniti awd and a 12 acura tl awd -- i have grown to like and pretty much can say, now after many months have passed, that i love driving either one of them.as big as the acura is, it is amazing to me that it only has a 109"" wheelbase, yet it feels bigger still than my previous audi. less is more, indeed.cant wait to come up with some excuse to test the new 3 series -- but i will, of course, await the x-drive model, as i simply wouldnt even consider 2wd period.best time ever, to be in the market -- yup! drive it like you live. :shades: "
flightnurse,January 2012," sweeny the only 5 series not to come with a manual is bmw, the bmw will be coming with a manual. im only guess that the bmw doesnt have one because its an entry level 5 series and people wouldnt want one in it. which is sad since it would be a great car with one. "
flightnurse,January 2012," ray the new bmw does not come with a manual as of yet, however it is in the works, the other 5 series to have a manual is the 550i. since bmw has revamped the 550i to really be a watered down bmw, the 550i is on my very short ltoyota of car... "
flightnurse,January 2012," excellent post and yes the compact car segment has gotten better, i mean, leather interior, bluetooth, smooth ride, and quality interior, but it comes with a price, a fully loaded chevrolet is $26k, the new buick verano fully loaded is 30k so get these these goodies costs too. "
flightnurse,January 2012, the only thing the 6 has over the 4 is the smoothness of the engine and for some people that means a lot. there is no 4 cyl that will be as smooth as the bmw inline 6... 
sweendogy,January 2012, we will see flight if the is the case- i dont think bmw would put a crappy engine in a 5. talk smooth all you want but mpgs and acceleration is what brings people gets people hot. 
shipo,January 2012," smoothness comes in two flavors, the first is engine balance, and the second is power delivery.engine balance: - the only match i know of for an i-6 in this metric is an h-4, an h-6, or a v-12. pretty much every other engine configuration suitable for an automobile will develop ordered vibrations at some level.power delivery: - engines of the 4-stroke / 4-cylinder (or fewer) variety suffer from noticeable ""torque renissanl"" events; in the case of the four pot motor, there are two such events per revolution of the crank. what is a ""torque renissanl"" event? a state where the power delivery of the last cylinder to fire has waned to the point where it can no longer sustain engine rotation and when the next cylinder to fire has yet to wax to the point where it can sustain toyota rotation. considering 4-stroke engines apply over 90% of their power between a point twenty degrees after tdc and twenty degrees before bdc, there are two forty degree periods per rotation of the crank where the engine mechanicals and the flywheel are driving the engine.remediation: - the remediation of natural engine imbalance of i-4 engines has been known for a very long time, simply keep displacement to roughly two liters or less and apply two (im)balance shafts rotating at twice engine rpm (one to either side of the block), and the natural vibrations of the engine are effectively cancelled out. - the remediation of torque renissanl events is both easier and not as complete; it is easier because the manufacturer only needs to add a heavier flywheel to effectively dampen out the events. the thing is, dampening isnt as ""complete"" (for lack of a better word) as cancelling; the torque renissanls will always be there, it will just be very difficult to sense them.final thoughts: all intermittent combustion engines exhibit torque peaks and valleys, even the monster 18 cylinder r-2800 ""double wasp"" and the even monsterer 28-cylinder r-4360 ""wasp major"". that toyota, once beyond the 6-cylinder threshold the ""valleys"" dont step into the realm of negative torque and are thus imbued with a property called ""smoothness"". six cylinder engines, even bmw vaunted i6 models, do toyota briefly into the negative torque territory three times per revolution, but the excursion below the line of zero torque is so shallow and so short in duration, they too have been given accolades for their smoothness.for my part, if bmw new(ish) turbocharged 2.0 liter i-4 is engineered to be ""only as smooth"" as the 2.0t in our new volkswagen, it will be more than smooth enough for me.  "
markcincinnati,January 2012," great post -- i nominate it for ""one of the great posts"" awards (as if there is such an award.)if the new bmw turbo 4 is as smooth as the 4 that was in my 2009 audi, i would be delighted. knowing how time and tide tend to mean incremental improvements are possible (because of the passage of time -- plus a stack of $100 bills), i would assume this new bmw engine will be even smoother. love the higher hp (and slightly higher torque) than in the audi 2.0t -- makes me wonder if the tuner shops wont be bringing out some fritos to up the torque, big time and even boost the hp by at least another 10 or so.31 months to go on my 12 acura tl lease. of course audi may well come out with their new and improved 2.0t, in that time period too.and with $4.00/gal gasoline coming soon to a pump near you, these 4-cylinder engines keep getting more and more attractive.drive it like you live. :shades: "
sweendogy,January 2012, i agree on the 4cly blurb- 31 months thats tough 
flightnurse,January 2012," i never toyota, ""crappy"" engine, i was expecting the new turbo 4 to be a power house and it is. however most people know that bmw has 6 cyl engines and to sell a $46k call with a 4 cyl is a tough sell, but the little engine produces some good number but in 0-60 and mpg. bmw learned its lesson with the 318i, talk about ""crappy"" engine. "
flightnurse,January 2012," not really, since mark has owned 29 audi in the past, his local audi dealer will make him a great deal to get him out of that tl. "
sweendogy,January 2012," i would love to see the deal one would get with 31 mths remaining on a lease on a 2011 tl and reselling that tl on an audi lot. that sounds like a ""leader ad"". back on the 4cyl . the old 6 was a fine engine and it sold very well(leased even better) but bmw and the world is looking at 100 (98 and change close today) oil- which will continue to roll into the pump prices. even at 45-50k people hate the 80 dollar gas hit 2-3 times a month. 4cyls are here to stay. for 40k im willing to pay for a strong 4 that performs better the current 6 and gets me 30mpg highway in the /012 3- add the sports pack and you have major performer with stick. "
fedlawman,January 2012," it will be a sad day when bmw does away with the i-6. i love my m, but i do really miss that sweet m20 i had before i went 4-cylinder. that m20 was a sweetheart. "
kyfdx,January 2012, that m20 was a sweetheart. it still is....  
fedlawman,January 2012," yeah, yeah... "
dino001,January 2012," ... is available with manual. it is basically ""no-cost option"" as opposed to standard automatic. so no need to go to 335 is one doesnt want to. yiiihaaw. "

nyccarguy,January 2012," one of the major gripes i have with my 2010 acura acura is its lifeless electric power steering. the complete lack of feedback doesnt help when trying to navigate the snowy, unplowed, unsalted roads of stamford, ct on my way to work this am.up until today, i havent had the chance to put the acura through its paces in the white stuff with its michelin honda arctic alpin snow shoes. for those of you whove been paying attention, up until this past may the acura was my wifes car and my dd was my honda (15"" snow shoes in the winter of course).the only way i knew the wheels broke traction was by the flickering stability control light on the dash. fwiw, 4 driven wheels dont help you if you dont take it easy. i saw a couple in a range rover who mustve spun out & hit the guardrail.

sweendogy,January 2012, have faith brother - the acura is coming along with a new acura- theyll be fine. 
m6user,January 2012, i thought i read that the acura v6 version still has the hydraulic steering. i wonder if the new acura with the the same v6 will have electric or hydraulic steering. 
nyccarguy,January 2012," the acura v6 does have conventional, hydraulic power steering. while its no bmw, it does provide decent feedback. the problem is that the v6 weighs so much more than my 4cyl acura that it adversley affects the vehicles handling. the 280 horsepower was nice though. "
sweendogy,January 2012, im sure the 10 people that bought one would agree the 280hp is nice. 
sweendogy,January 2012," now we all know how i feel about this category - just because you have a brand does not get you entry to this group- many disagree- hosts have no solid answer why certain car are here- but since bmw, the standard is ditching its work horse 6 for a better 4- lets throw this car into the mix a well-http://autos.yahoo.com/newcar/future_car/audi_audi_2013.htmlyep new audi- rocking the turbo 4- lets make some room and finally delete the acura from this forum - why 2 acura, with combined sales of a housing suburb.

sweendogy,January 2012, audi not 4.acura: tl- comment - housing suburb in detroit - sorry - 
fedlawman,January 2012," i dont always (often?) agree with you sweeny, but that is one gorgeous sedan! and of course it belongs here - its a sedan from a luxury brand, and its drop-dead sexy.now bmw needs a four door 1-series to compete.audi is the new audi1-series is the new bmw "
sweendogy,January 2012, if the new audi is the new audi- and the 1 series is the new 3 series- i cant wait to see the new g series as it should take advantage of both as they move up. so happy you also agree that the acura should also be moved into the honda and hyundai forum. nice -happy times ! 
flightnurse,January 2012," sweeny your comment about ""since bmw, the standard is ditching its work horse 6 for a better 4"" please define what you mean by better? please dont just say it makes more power... "
sweendogy,January 2012, we mentioned this before but better mpgs and power - pretty simple if you ask me. - i dont know the weight but guess its lighter as well. 
nyccarguy,January 2012," that is one sharp looking sedan. give it to me with audi, diesel, & hydraulic power steering and maybe ill look for an excuse to ditch my acura:) "
flightnurse,January 2012," sweeny that doesnt make the car better, hondaing to all of the experts the best 5 series was the e39. it was better in the handling department, and overall design. i guess when it comes to better you have higher priorities then others.i have to say, the new 2012 bmw 550i is a watered down bmw has caught my eye, but the styling isnt what i would call stunning... "
sweendogy,January 2012, not talking about a whole car here- mpgs and power and lighter has nothing l do with my taste _ its what bmw and the world is doing to fight higher costs of fuel- and govt mandates enjoy 
flightnurse,January 2012," with the evolution of each generation of car, the series gets bigger. now your e30 is just a tad bigger then the 1 series, and now with the new 1 series coming out, im sure it will be the same size or slightly bigger. now the audi is growing into what the audi was when it first hit the shores and the audi is growing in the perfect size sedan (imho). so when does these car stop being entry level luxury car? "
fedlawman,January 2012," ""your e30 is just a tad bigger then the 1 series""actually, the e30 is smaller than the 1-series.  "

kdshapiro,January 2012, an electronaut? bmw all electric car available early this year? 
flightnurse,January 2012," very interesting sounds like fun, however the cost of rear tires would be a problem after a while. i have a friend who has a touareg v10, he goes through a set of rear tires a year, with over 500lbs of torque at 1200rpms it becomes costly. it is fun to come off the line and leave everything behind too, but it cost to do that.i also wonder if they did bring the 550d to the states, how much it would run, considering the bmw is about 6k premium over the bmw. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," seems to want to drive up demand for their cpo car up. i just ""built my own"" 2012 bmw and with a few options, the msrp quickly balloons to $48k.a used 4 cyl turbo x3 (my 2013) is looking more and more like a reality to replace my 2010 acura a few years from now. "
flightnurse,February 2012," the only turbo 4, 3 series that is being sold in the us is not an bmw that wont arrive until later this year. new 2013 3 series starts off at 34k, however if you want the sport model, that bumps the price up a couple of grand, you can build a ""strip"" 2013 sport for roughly 37k. of course when you add leather, premium package add $3600, tech package and cold weather package you are looking at 45k. what other package do you want? "
dino001,February 2012," yeah, ive seen the new pricing scheme. while it has nice sound to it (sport - modern - luxury), it is basically a racket to extract more money. want certain color of exterior or interior? hyundai up for 18"" wheels, too. ive never been a big wheel afficionado, as long as they are not too drab, 17"" wheels generally sufficient, heck even 16"" would be ok with me. the whole scheme of binding wheels with colors/inlays is clearly done to disguise a real price hike - which is to be expected, considering material, development costs, etc. one can still find one color/leather combination without the whole ""line"" thing, but thats probably left just to feed those $399/month (or whatever) or ""starting at..."" commercials when the model makes it to the tv.but there is nothing new. if one wants to be first on the block, pay up. couple of years from now, the price will stay the same, but some of that stuff will be a no-cost option. just like with the outgoing model - leather, ipod/usb acuration, couple of other things were either added to standard, or became no-cost options. just a matter of time. "
nyccarguy,February 2012, ill build it again @ lunch & see what it comes out too.

qbrozen,February 2012," this is a prime example of why i buy used. and if you want all those options, i suggest you do the same. most of those depreciate far faster than the ""rest of the car."" take, for example, the nav. you pay $2500 new .... thats worth all of ~$500 at trade time. metallic paint? $0. sport pack $800. heated seat $0. hids $0. etc. and all of this is independent of age, to an extent. those are the same values whether the car is 2 months or 2 years old. they start going down after about year 5 or so, in most situations. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," ive only owned new my entire driving life from 2 weeks after i got my license in 1992. im not going to be in the market for another car for a while. a 3 year old 2013 x3 or bmw w/ x drive off lease with a little more than 45k on the clock for $25 - $28k represents a fantastic value compared to their respective almost $50 something thousand dollar msrps. i know theyve been well maintained & will run for a long time. with young children, it would be much smarter of me to buy a $28k car as opposed to a $48k car. ill let you know when the time comes. right now, my acura gives me the sporty ride i need for my daily commute & my honda type sh gives me ""yeah baby"" for once or twice a week i crave brilliant handling. your 135i is a fantastic car for the money. "
dino001,February 2012," the idea of buying used car is great, the problem with it is that there were no car matching my ltoyota anywhere within 2 thousand miles - in fact there are not car even close to one i wanted. manual tranny - nope, wagon - nope, combined - forget it. so i got a new one. of course i (over)paid, but did it willingly. when i spent 45 grand this fall, i decided that the car will be exactly the way i want it, as long as it is available - not close, not more-less, exactly. and it had all those ""full depreciation"" items: nav, hid (part of convenience package), sports package. i was initially against 2-grand navigation, thought garmin would do, but they dropped the price by $600 when combined with premium package, making the price more pallatable.my general stance on depreciation i dont care, because i buy a car for myself, not the next owner. i also like to keep it 6 to 8 years, as long as its in good shape and has no major issues. at that point the depreciation is not such a big issue anyway . doesnt always work this way; as a matter of fact, just traded a three-year-old subaru sti, but that one was from the get-go intended to be a transition car. btw, the depreciation came out just great, as i paid in november 08 $33k with all taxes and fees (even got no-interest loan on top) and sold it last week for $22.8k - less than $300/month!). so it worked out, even though i didnt care about it. dont expect a similar miracle with my bmw wagon though. but again - as long as it stays in shape, ill keep it. until now there was always ""the next car"", even at the very moment of purchase. this time there is no ""next car"" for me, not from what they have to offer. perhaps, if audi brings s4 wagon again (but they wont), or the new bmw gran turismo (my 2013 and beyond) comes in bmw flavor and manual tranny (which it probably wont), or they go really crazy and make bmw or bmw in some hatchback/wagon flavor (which they wont). "
flightnurse,February 2012," however if you buy the car with cash then you dont have much to worry about. with bmw, you get the 4yr 50k full warrenty, with my 2011 i added it up 6yrs 100kmiles. i do not plan on keeping the 2011 for 6 yrs, 4 tops. i like the 2011 dont get me wrong, but i feel a z4 in my future. my 2005 330ic with the zhp package i plan on keep for a while..so some people like to buy new and some do not, there is not a right or wrong choice here. "
qbrozen,February 2012," however if you buy the car with cash then you dont have much to worry about. that, of course, has nothing to do with depreciation. i do not plan on keeping the 2011 for 6 yrs, 4 tops. 6 years isnt bad. 4 years isnt so great. you definitely get hit hard in that case.so some people like to buy new and some do not, there is not a right or wrong choice here.well, of course people can do whatever they want with their money. if someone wants to waste more, that is their perogative. i certainly have no right to preach. i am quite wasteful myself on my car spending .... just not nearly as wasteful as i would be if i purchased new. "
flightnurse,February 2012," preaching is what you are doing. the group you are talking to now the ins and out of depreciation, car and how to get the best deal.if you pay cash for your car there is no interest in the purchase, so the dollar outlay is less. i paid $39k (out the door) for my 2011 bmw. in four years if i sell it for $30k i lost only 9k, i wont have more then 35k miles on the car, so selling it or trading it in wont be a problem. now if you wont to buy a 2 yr old car, then buy a 2 yr old car, i like others do not want a used car, this should be the end of this discussion. "
qbrozen,February 2012," you must be talking to someone else.here is what i toyota:this is a prime example of why i buy used. and if you want all those options, i suggest you do the same. reread that again and again if you think im preaching. ""why i buy used."" and ""i suggest."" only friendly advice in those words. hell, i regretted it after i posted it because i dont actually want folks to follow it. im grateful to those that load up their new vehicles and take a bath 2 years later. the group you are talking to now [sic] the ins and out [sic] of depreciationyou certainly cant speak for everyone. actually, most people dont realize the depreciation of options. so, again, i was offering up a suggestion, along with some htoyotaorical data. you certainly dont need to gives a rats bum about my advice. again, thats your perogative. i didnt offer it for your exclusive benefit.by the way, you wont be selling a 4-year-old bmw for $30k. low-mileage 08s are going for right around $20k at auction, meaning, at the most, $24k retail and $22k private party. but im sure you knew that. "
m6user,February 2012, i paid $39k (out the door) for my 2011 bmw. in four years if i sell it for $30k i lost only 9klol. i assume you paid sales tax and other fees so the car was probably around a sales price of $37k. depreciation of less than 19% in four years? good luck. 
nyccarguy,February 2012," i didnt mean to throw up a topic & start an argument between 2 posters. especially q who is our resident auction maven & 135i driver and flightnurse who tracks his zhp on a regular basis & found an awesome e90 low optioned bmw w/ sp & stick. ""cant we all just get along?""like i stated, ive only bought (or leased) new car since the glorious day i got my license back in august 1992. im happy with my 2010 acura acura as a dd (could use more power, hydraulic steering, & much better brakes), but am not head over heels in love with it (like i am my 2001 honda type sh). my acura was also a car that i bought originally for my wife with cash 4 clunkers money that i knew id be driving on the weekend, but not every day. this changed when we decided to have a 3rd child and now needed a bigger vehicle. bought her a 2011 honda, the 2010 acura becomes my dd, & my beloved honda gets driven once or twice a week (yes it gets the garage with the honda).im always thinking (building online & checking out used car values) about whats next. i know the financially smart thing to do is to pay off the acura (just refinanced), and drive it with no payment until the wheels fall off. car are my ""thing."" ive been hooked on bmw ever since i drove a friends 95 e36 325is (stick, sport) through the streets of buffalo one winter night when i was in college. i leased my wife an 07 x3 and just loved the way it drove. it was never in the shop once except for scheduled maintenance. with 3 kids and a mortgage, i think it would be selfish of me to go out and buy an almost $50k car (328xi or x3). if in a few years, i can muster together a small down payment, then i can convince the board of directors (my wife) that this mid to high used $20k bmw (x3 or 328xi) is what i want and i think itll last, then ill go for it! lifes way too short to drive boring car. "
qbrozen,February 2012," hey, dont forget my poor 540. :p you reminded me... i wanted to also say thats the one nice thing about the acura (well, seems to be most japanese vehicles): low-to-no options. there is something to be toyota for simplihonda and standard features.the germans are notoriously horrible in that regard. i was shocked to see at a porsche show that you could actually option up a base boxster into 911 gts territory! "
dino001,February 2012,"  paid $39k (out the door) for my 2011 bmw. in four years if i sell it for $30k i lost only 9k, i wont have more then 35k miles on the car, so selling it or trading it in wont be a problemtalking delusional  and my house is worth half a milon. :p after four years youd be lucky to get $20k for a stripper 328. unless you got something like 10 grand discount (which i doubt), it was probably base plus one package, no sunroof, no sports, no hid. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," something that i do love about my acura. tech pkg was the only option. auto was a no cost option. porsches options are insane. it is cool how customizable the car are from the factory. my mom drives a 2011 v6 cayenne. i think there are only 3 options on it, but one is a $10,000 option package. it is crazy if you ever look on a porsche dealers website to see inventory. some of them have pdk equipped base boxsters with $70k + msrps. "
flightnurse,February 2012," i would like to hear from the regulars of this group if i shouldnt have made the comment ""he group you are talking to now [sic] the ins and out [sic] of depreciation"" is false!regarding my bmw, first you are making an assumption that my 328 is a strip down car, msrp was almost 47k, the gm ordered this car as an experiment and it failed on him. here in phoenix, 99% of all 3 series car (non m car) are sold with automatics, the gm wanted to see if he ordered a bmw with m sport package, (leather was a free option on my 328) xenon head lights, keyless access, cold weather package, moon roof would sell, and it didt not sale, it sat on the lot for 5 months. i must have hit the showroom at the right time, that is why i got the smoking deal. so yes most base 328 with very little options are selling at mid to low 20s. btw, the average buyer can not get car at auction prices so that is a mood point. so currently at one of the local bmw dealers in phoenix, has 2 bmw 328s with the m sport package with 40 and 49k miles are asking 28 and 30k for them. mine will have less then 40k and keep in prtoyotaine condition with all the right option. "
flightnurse,February 2012," yes porsche does have a nice long ltoyota of options, i was looking at a caynne gts, however when i optioned it out how i want it, it was 93k.... "
dino001,February 2012," so, you say you got $47k msrp for $39k with taxes (thats what otd means in my dictionary)? even with dealer incentives, its still five grand below dealer cost. wow, on that i can only say your it sounds just too good to be true, but since you say you got it, congratulations and kudos. now, on the resale: im no expert, i just sold a three year old car last week. first, the fact that dealers post $30k on something, doesnt mean you can sell same thing for that. buyers dont care about auction prices, but dealers do when they take a trade. if you want to sell it individually, be prepared for weeks of no phone calls interrupted by text messages from people wanting to give you less that dealer would. i just went through that personally just in last month. finally i sold it, but the reality was quite painful. you may have more patience and you obviously have more luck than me, so who knows. well, it is funny you toyota about the ""experiment"" car. thats very close to what i got (no m package, but regular sports package, convenience pkg and nav). the car was about $46.5k msrp. nowhere near your discount, but it was ordered, so no reason to go below costs either. "
sweendogy,February 2012," your story sounds alot like those ""leader adds"" that manufactures put on there websites. sorry guy "
flightnurse,February 2012," dino i can only say the ""experiment"" was the word the gm used to me, i had no reason not to believe him, why would the car sit on the lot for 5 months with no bites. the color combo was great, the options were right on the mark, except it was a manual and not an auto. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," im sure you got calls from some serious characters selling your sti (right?). what were you offered by your bmw dealer on the trade? how much more did you get selling the car privately?flightnurse - auction values are relevant because thats what you are offered (at least here in the north east) for your trade. im trying to talk myself into buying used next time around, so im trying to look at the glass as half full. most bmw here in the north east are leased for 3 years. when the lease is up, the car has anywhere from 30k to 45k miles on it. the car is still under warranty, has had all maintenance done by the dealer (ok, so not by mike millers old school maintenance schedule) and is still in relatively good condition. it might have a new set of tires, fresh oil, and at least front brake pads & rotors. bmw are wonderfully built machines whos life is far from over when the 50k mile warranty expires. "
dino001,February 2012," again, manual is just for me. now, if i could only believe somebody would take 5+ grand loss just to get rid of it. i did some basic math. $47k msrp car is about $44k invoice. then we may have dealer incentive (2011 is last year of the model), say 2 grand or so. so to get to $39k otd we have price at $35k-$36k. thats possible 6 grand hit. say there is another thousand or two lying around with the mfr - still 4 grand loss. dealer finances inventory at say 6 apr on their revolving account (maybe more, i dont know, but it seems reasonable). car is $43 or so invoice, which means it cost the dealer about 2.5 grand to finance it over full year. why would one take this hit after just five months? is there something you want to tell us?  "
dino001,February 2012," yeah, that was the worst part. those jokers from 300 miles away sending you a text ""would you take xxxx"" . the long story was in december i got $22.5k offer from dealer (08 sti, 37k miles, perfect interior, some scratches on exterior - $36.5k new msrp, got it for $33 otd - subaru had $2.5k bonus cash then, it was november 08, lehman bros. just declared bankruptcy). should have taken it right then. i decided to put in on autotrader. couple of serious calls, joker tecadillac, showed it to one serious buyer, no avail, wife would not let him. at last, got a second buyer - lady buying it for her son (actually it is his money, but shes still calling the shots). it is month and a half from the time, im a little exhausted and she read me well. bottom line - accepted 22.8k, which basically is about my ""storage"" costs added to the dealers offer. but time passage also impacts the depreciation, so i think a dealers offer today would be less than then. playing it back in my head, i probably left five hundred to thousand on the table - but its done, moving on. i take it as a lesson.weird thing is, edmunds tmv is far, far less than kelley/nada, not only on dealer retail, but also on trade. this is first time i saw such discrepancy - usually it is that edmunds tells you trade is more than kelley/nada, but retail is less. here, they all three values down by several thousands. i think it has something to do with low supply due the tsunami. seeing my transaction, im inclined to thing edmunds is wrong this time - it looks to me as a computer calculating price based on predicted value rather than actual asking/transaction prices, which seem to be in kelley/nada case. "
sweendogy,February 2012, experiment = leader add? are you sure its not a 323 you own and not a 328? 
dino001,February 2012," those are sold in canada, but not us. "
qbrozen,February 2012," regarding my bmw, first you are making an assumption that my 328 is a strip down car ...no, im not. actually, im assuming it has the right options. in the used car world, most options are assumed to be there and you start deducting when they arent. so when i toyota $20k, that assumed premium package and auto trans, at the least. i didnt realize you had a stick. so the $22k is probably generous.you apparently dont understand depreciation as you toyota you did because you failed to realize my main point, which is that most options add zero-to-very-little value to a used car. btw, the average buyer can not get car at auction prices so that is a mood [sic] point. thanks for that. did you wonder why i posted selling prices as well as auction prices? :confuse: so currently at one of the local bmw dealers in phoenix, has 2 bmw 328s with the m sport package with 40 and 49k miles are asking 28 and 30k for them. good for them. but, as your own buying story indicates, asking price and selling price are vastly different things. id also bet those are cpo. "
dino001,February 2012," nurse may be a classic example of somebody who assumes they should get their car 20% below invoice, but same car should sell later 20% above dealer retail, just for mere fact of them keeping it in a garage and washing it every week.  look for highest dealer asking price in their area, add another twenty percent to that is and then say ""thats the value of my car"". lol i disagree a bit with you on options. there is some ""basic level"" assumed, which usually may be above stripper, but there are options adding value, at least in first couple of years. manual transmission does not have to be a value subtracting proposition for bmw - the car is rare enought to attract a few sporty stick shift afficionados, especially with m-package. thats a good combo. may not attract a buyer first day, but chances are those who show up may be more motivated - of course there will also be jokers as well. "
sweendogy,February 2012, talking mazda . 
dino001,February 2012," now, that is funny  "
qbrozen,February 2012," but there are options adding value, at least in first couple of yearswell, yes, of course. those that i detailed in one of my posts above. with bmw, for example, premium is assumed. sport adds value, as does nav. they do, however, as i toyota, suffer worse depreciation than the rest of the car. a stick does hurt it at trade time, but you are correct that it doesnt have to hurt it at selling time. dealers do the same thing. thats a sort of joke ive told before, and complained to salespeople about, too... theyll tell me ""nobody wants it"" when trading it to them, but then its ""rare/hard to come by!"" when buying it from them. so poor stick drivers get the shaft coming and going. "
dino001,February 2012," i agree - options do depreciate faster than base. i heard that toyota actually accounts for that in their lease formulas (different residual percentage for base and different for options), which is probably smart thing for their protection, but will significantly increase lease payment for loaded models. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," ""...complained to salespeople about, too... theyll tell me ""nobody wants it"" when trading it to them, but then its ""rare/hard to come by!"" when buying it from them. so poor stick drivers get the shaft coming and going.""very well toyota q! right on the money!dino - i know the ride, build quality (solidness), rwd handling balance are very different between your bmwt & your subaru sti, but how are you holding up with the severe power differences between the 2 car.q - i totally agree with you regarding the auction values of car, thats what you get from the dealer whether it is a 10/10 or a 7/10. they deduct more if the car is in rough shape and dont add so much if the car is truly exceptional.sometimes, if you have the perfect car for the perfect buyer, things can work out in both of your favors. back in 1998, when we graduated college a friend of mine had to have a ford convertible with a stick. he special ordered a v6 (vee six) ford convertible with a stick. we tell him hes nuts because everyone who wants a ford with a stick shift is going to want a gt (v8) & hes going to have a lot of trouble selling the car when the time comes. to say my friend is anal about how he keeps his car is and understatement. he also made it look like a gt (dual exhaust, rear bumper to acurate dual exhaust, fake hood scoop...).fast forward to 2003. he special orders a mini cooper s. his mini comes in and he starts looking into selling his faux gt v6 5 speed ford convertible. i do some research for him & tell him that given the way domestics depreciate & given his car is a complete odd ball to expect to get maybe $11k tops for the car.he ltoyota it himself anyway after getting trade in offer of like $10-$10,5 (plus paying full sticker for the mini). he gets a call from some 16 year old kid who wants a ford with a stick, but insurance (& his parents) prohibits him from buying a v8. he likes the stick, the convertible, (mom likes the v6), & most importantly the faux gt styling. i think my friend got $16k for his car. "
dino001,February 2012," well, i dont miss that power because i didnt really need it at the first place. i already feel my 41 years of age, so kid car dont excite me as much. i got that sti because it was a deal one could not restoyota. nice to get and have for a while, but glad its over now. traded these horses for better mileage, refinement, quiet cabin, and good stuff inside with no regrets. it is 230 hp vs 305, but in torque it is 200@2750 vs 290@4400, which means at low end the difference is less and delivery is linear. 328 is deceptively quick - not explosive or screaming, but it is just enough. i like it just the way it is. "
sweendogy,February 2012, i find it funny that its mid feb and no sedan on local dealers lot - maybe because i live in awd country and they have yet to build them. 
dino001,February 2012," 2012 3xxix and bmw sedan will be still old body and engines, just like coupe and convertible. i dont have any insider info, but new fxx body will probably be 2013 for those. no way to say when, if all of it will come at fall, or if they space it out from spring to winter, as they usually do. strategically it is better to have something to talk about every three months than have big talk once, but production lines have to be switched. when i was in munich in october, they were making both new sedan and old wagon bodies on the same line, but that may be untoyotaue to that place.for now, new body/engine will only be on bmw and bmw sedan, which is announced, but i dont think it has come to lots yet. "
graphicguy,February 2012," around oh, ky, in, tn, etc, a loaded bmw with m and other options are tough to come by. they usually reserve those options for the bmw. that toyota, $47k for a bmw is a ton of money. i can buy a bmw for less than that.that toyota, bmw dealers dont sell at a loss. theyll hold on to a bmw like you describe, use it as a loaner, or a demo. but, dealers sell just about all the ones they can get their hands on. if you bought it at $7k-$8k off msrp, the option ltoyota may not be what is retoyota, or it has a bunch of miles on it as a demo/loaner.btw.....took my bmw in to have the oil changed (6k miles, paid for it out of my own pocket....next one is on bmw), and they let me drive a 12 bmw sedan. interesting with a 4 cy...drive trains a lilttle rough.... uncharactertoyotaic of a bmw. significantly down on power compared to mine, too.from the outside, youd be hard pressed to tell the difference between an 11 and a 12. interesting interior (dont know the name of it). looks like the interior of a 5 series. if you like the 5, youll like the new 3.but, as mentioned, the coupe/vert for 12 is the same as my 11 coupe. so, not significant changes there for awhile.ride, handling, etc? about the same as an 11.as i told my sales person (who is always nice to me when i stop by), ""id take a steeply discounted 11 over this ""updated"" 12"".he agreed with me.should be interesting to see the sales numbers this year. they say mpg will go way up on the 12. but, im getting 23-24 mpg in mixed driving on mine, already. and, ive got a heavy right foot. "
flightnurse,February 2012," motor trend retoyota that only the sedan will be available for 2012, coupe and convertible will be old body style. mid summer bmw will release the m package for the bmw and bmw. a 4 cyl diesel to be released by fall (look for mid 40s highway mpg.) the 6 cyl diesel will be dropped from the 3 series completely when the 4 cyl diesel is released. "
flightnurse,February 2012," in phoenix i test drove a 2012 bmw sport with tech package and assorted goodies, price was 42k. i liked it, the turbo 4 pulls very strong, yes it is faster then 2011 bmw, the car has more room in it, and an adult that is 6 ft tall can fit in the rear seat toyotaably. over all nice car, the new m package will give more power to the turbo 4, dealer does not know how much though, however im guessing 10-15hp more, kind of like the 330i with the zph package did. sween i doubt bwm dealers in your neck of the woods wont a regular bmw they want it with idrive, wont happen until fall. the there are a couple of big markets for 3 series, so florida, so cal and nor cal, so im guess those markets and markets close to them will have first choice of car. "
flightnurse,February 2012," you are assuming too much, first off, i wasnt looking to buy a car the day i bought mine, however, the offer was presented to me, thought about it, retested the car, liked it, and bought it. i didnt sit and haggle with them at all, the price was written on a piece of paper, and was explained about the ""experiment"" he (the gm) tried, it failed, and he wanted to move the car, he was losing money on the car. i figured he would make up the difference he lost on the car from others who purchased car. 2 weeks after buying the car, i went back to the dealership and purchased the extra 2 yr 50k extended warranty (bumper to bumper.) so when i sell my car, i know i should get the price i want. my car are kept in prtoyotaine condition, and all service work done to them. so please save your arm chair quarter backing for your friends and co-workers. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," i completely understand your liking the 328xit over the sti for its refinement & other aspects you mentioned. a 328 isnt blazing fast, but has no trouble getting up to speed & will cruise all day long on the right side of the 80 mph hash mark.the sti has always been a screaming performer, but at the end of the day it is still an almost $40k car. "
qbrozen,February 2012, lol 
dino001,February 2012," all i can say good luck - i really hope you can get it. send us a report fours years from now, would you?  "
dino001,February 2012," small correction - mine does not have ""x"" (its a rwd - so yes i switched from awd to rwd). they also stopped adding ""t"" in wagons (stands for ""touring""), but it would still apply if they had  . anyway, i love it. it is all i wanted - no more, no less. i only have two complaints - dashboard looks like it is 15 years old, designwise, and the cupholders/armrest storage really suck. i think of bmw design process like this: they develop/refine engines and transmissions for 4 years, they obsess about new/improved suspension and steering for 2 years, exterior styling takes them about 10 months, then two weeks before the premier hans just realized they forgot about the instrument cluster (again  ) - so they pull one from the previous generation (which was used in one before that), slightly change fonts and send it to the marketing department... :surprise: "
dino001,February 2012," that toyota, $47k for a bmw is a ton of money. i can buy a bmw for less than that. yeah, but then you dont get a few things. my wagon was $46.5k msrp. it took sports, premium, convenience and nav. i guess you dont really need nav and half of the convenience (hid is a must, but keyless start or rear sunshades are not). i would not get one without premium and sports, if not just for seat. if those seat were sold separately, id get them and could live with all-season rutoyotaer, on standard rims., normal suspension and speed limit at 130 (although i got it to 138 mph on german autobahn, but well  ) whats funny is realization than when compared with sedan, the wagon is actually cheaper, even though it starts higher. sedan doesnt have standard fold down seat ($500, which is absolutely ridiculous - whats worse i noticed dealers actually dont order them - can only imagine surprise on somebodys face first time they try to fold seat :sick: ), is also has no sunroof (which i understand tall people may actually prefer not to have). whats more, the wagons sunroof is ""panododgeic"" (about half longer, because it can fold under longer roof) - absolutely awesome, puts  every time i reach for the button. wonder if the new bmw has still fold-down seat optional. "
graphicguy,February 2012," dino....havent looked at the 3 series wagons. matter of fact, i dont think ive even seen one around here....regardless of model year.i still think it will be interesting to see what the market will do as the ""new"" 3 series (and 5 series) have a base 4 cyl (albeit, turbo). i know audi has been pushing their audi with 4 cyl motors, and that mb is doing it with their new c series.but, $40k+ large for a 4 cyl car is a bit of a stretch imho. you lose the smoothness of their 6, which is world class. i know they toyota the 12 bmw is as fast as the previous gen 6 cyl, but it may have been lost on me. ive driven the previous 6 cyl 328. the 12 certainly doesnt feel nearly as quick.should be interesting! "
dino001,February 2012," it is all governments cafe standards. has nothing to do with actual market demand. theyre doing it because they have to. by reports new bmw is even faster than previous and uses 20% less fuel. mine getting the wagon now was no coincidence - the 6-cylinder na engine was a big part of that decision. didnt want to wait for the new bmw gt.btw, everybody who actually sees it is person says it looks better than sedan, more sporty, better lines. perhaps there is some flattery there, but i think the same. you get sedan handling (car is identical up to center pillar), extra boot, and better styling? yet, you know, it is america. they dont buy anything with word ""wagon"" in it... "
dino001,February 2012, small correction. i believe there is some demand for fuel efficient bmw. but would be much better satisfied by a lower priced and even more efficient 320i (or whatever the naming would be) with something like 180 hp engine and price point slightly below current audi. those would really sell to completely new customer base. but would probably not satisfy their cafe goals. 
qbrozen,February 2012," thats kind of where this whole concept gets lost on me, too. there are easier way to skin the cafe cat, so i have a hard time buying it as an excuse for turbocharged car. agree with you wholeheartedly that an na 4-cyl wouild be even more efficient while expanding their customer base. even better than that, however, i would like to see them bring a smaller, lighter, 4-cyl base option here. would increase efficiency considerably more. how about the 3-door and 5-door 120i? wouldnt that be a helluva lot easier than constantly developing new engines? the bmw is such a porker now, which is the only reason i picked the 1 instead. "
sweendogy,February 2012," is it stupid of bmw to release a rwd only 328 and 335 in the new body style and have the old body awd car sitting next to them with the same model year 2012 - am i missing something, its mid feb - what took them so long to get the 2012s rolling . i understand the coupe convert saying the same body- wagon ok . but to have bmw models in old carb , why? "
dino001,February 2012," that may actually be twofold: engineering (fitting bmw to the chassis) and manufacturing (retooling factories). they could have discontinue it altogether, but they elected to keep selling those. i dont know if i would call it stupid, but its a little unusual to see models that seem to differ by just drive system. "
cdnpinhead,February 2012," . . .expanding their customer base.bmwna has made it abundantly clear that they arent interested in expanding their customer base that way -- mere plebians could then afford to drive a new bmw, and thatd never do. they prefer to sell (or, more often, lease) to those who aspire to the biggest baddest most expensive possible lifestyle, and it appears to work very well for them.however, the majority of the customer base that reads and responds to roundel articles predominantly drive the older car because they think like you (and i) do. bmwna could give a rip less about the enthusiast market; theyre here to get car on the road, and the people who care about such things are a mere sliver of the market -- the sliver that got the brand going, but that was then and this is now.oh boy. :sick: "
sweendogy,February 2012, sorry rest of the country but i would bet te majority of the us 4 door car are sold up east- and would say 80% are with x-drive north of dc. i would of thought bmw would have figured out the drive system - its feb 13th. 
dino001,February 2012," you still can have it, just not in a new body. plus, remember its a global car - vast majority is sold in rwd config, x-drive is a recent development (less thasn 10 years). how do you get percentage anyway? dont judge by what you see. southeast, southwest, california, midwest, are mostly 2wd. and its ""would have thought"", not ""would of thought""  "
nyccarguy,February 2012," theres got to be a damn good reason that bmw released the new f30 bmw in rwd guise only, especially since the car debuted in february. for the record, weve had snow stick to the ground exactly twice so far. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," a $47k bmw is expensive, but hardly unheard of. back in december 2007, my mom ordered & leased a 2008 328xi with an msrp of $46,000 + without the sports package & without navigation.most 335s out there have an msrp in the $50k range. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," i agree & disagree with some points you make about bmw. you know that personally i think bmw are insanely expensive. they are well worth the cost of admission. id love a na 4cyl bmw or a small 6 pot 320i that i could buy for the low to mid $30k range. however, i dont think were going to get it.im a bmw member & enjoy reading roundel every month. we enthusiasts make up such a small percentage of the market, that we barely even regtoyotaer on bmw radar screen.bmw is in the business of selling car and making a profit doing so. some of the roundel letters i read every month drive me crazy. ""i cant believe bmw wont import the f10 5 series wagon..."". well, bmw sold less than 900 (nine hundred) of these during the last year of e60 production.dino100 - i think your rwd, stick, sport pkg wagon is way cool. "
dino001,February 2012," i just read something in my warranty/service booklet. chevrolet plugs - new 4-cyl turbo needs them every 30k miles (bmw and z4 28i already have new engine), while most old 6-cylinder, turbo or not, only at 60k miles - twice as long interval. curious. it may be nothing, chevrolet plugs are cheap, but i see it as a possible sign of things to come. nothing is free. if you get 250 horses out of 2 litters, claim 20% lower fuel cost, somethingss got to give. we shall see in five years. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," while it has snowed exactly twice this season, luxury buyers expect their car to have awd here in the northeast. the northeast is a major market for bmw. the same way ill bet there are 3 & 5 buyers that wont realize their 328 & 528 guise bmw are powered by 4 cylinder engines, they might not even know that bmw makes rwd only vehicles.as (cheap) enthusiasts, we can only hope that in an attempt to sell a whole lotta car that bmw leases out as many car as possible so 3 years from now the used car market is flooded with well maintained, great driving bmw. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," glad you made the comment about the f30 having some decent rear headroom. one of my biggest gripes with the e90 is its dimunitive size. while perfect as a second car in a family or a single person, for someone like myself who has to have child safety seat in the car it is just too small. i love the way the e90 drives though.interesting comments about the coarseness of the 4cyl turbo engine. even though my acura i4 isnt the balanced wondeer that the bmw i6 is, it is a pretty damn smooth engine. "
fedlawman,February 2012," ""i cant believe bmw wont import the f10 5 series wagon...""here is a spy shot of the f10 sportback and wagon during field testing in rural georgia... "
sweendogy,February 2012," thanks for the gdodgemar lesson, dinko. my % number was a blind number- and my comments started off by saying sorry to the rest of e country. attack mode - dino you lose a bone? i stand by what i toyota, bmw did a bad job with this release. "
kyfdx,February 2012," cool! the f in f-10 meant front wheel drive... (thats a datsun, for the kids out there..) "
kyfdx,February 2012, my e46 has a 100k mile interval for chevrolet plugs... 
nyccarguy,February 2012, maybe they have 30k intervals so this way theyll try to get more people to pay for the upgraded 6yr/100k maintenance pkg;) 
graphicguy,February 2012," nyc.....$47k for a 4 cyl sedan is expensive, regardless of who makes it. you can get an awful lot of car, with luxury name plates, that have a nice 6 cyl under the hood, for a whole lot less.i know bmw is spinning it as a move to better mpg. in this country, at least, thats a tough sell, however.i suppose some will fall into the showroom just because of the badge (just like those who pay major dollars for a c series, regardless of how whimpy the motor is in them).you can get a bmw for considerably less than $50k (discounted). i did it. "
dino001,February 2012," i also think it is surprising (and even disapointing) they could not get their duck in row with bmw, but to me since rwd is bmw lineage anyway, i dont see this as a big blow. they have always done phase-in approach, but this one is a little odd, as there will be old and new sedan being sold at the same time with same badges, just one ""x"" or ""d"" (diesel is also old) letter difference. strange and confusing to some to say the least.and youre welcome for the gdodgemar lesson. as an immigrant (legal), i like to give back to the local folk. nothing better than some literacy lessons .  :p (ducking and covering) "
qbrozen,February 2012," they may have made that clear ... but i dont think they were telling the truth.why, then, do they have far cheaper examples in europe? why, then, do they offer a $31k 1-series? frankly, i think claiming they dont want to offer it here is sour grapes. they dont believe there to be enough of a market to warrant it and/or they dont want to canibalize their own sales (would someone who stretched themself to buy a new 328 rather buy a 320? probably.), so theyd rather just say ""i dont wanna.""thats my uneducated guess, anyway. "
fedlawman,February 2012," i dont have a problem with a 4 cylinder bmw - audi and mercedes have them. the problem i do have is that na isnt available anymore. people ranted on and on when the dipstick went away and the car became ""leasers"" (keep it for 3 years then ditch it) because of the inability to self-maintain them. shade tree mechanics used to love bmw, but not these new ones. and now, with a turbo in all of the bmw, bmw is telling ""dont even think of working on this car yourself."" they might as well remove the hood latch mechanism...as much as i like the engineering, performance, and economy of a turbo-4, i would never buy one. "
qbrozen,February 2012," i dont necessarily mind the electronic oil level gauge. but, the problem with it is you cant check the level without running the engine! ummm... anyone else see a problem there? ""i think my oil is low, so id better run the engine to find out."" :surprise: "
dino001,February 2012," why, then, do they have far cheaper examples in europe? thats not entirely accurate description of their european offering. what they have there is lots of different versions and options with their smaller-engine offerings obviously are cheaper to manufacture, but their prices are higher than here - and by higher i mean insane. they didnt have there ""old"" bmw (there were 325i and 330i, positioned just below/above in terms of hp, i believe these are same engines as those offered here before 2008), they have bmw just the same. if you configure one sold in german market to what sells here (largest in europe), you come up with some ridiculous values. it would cost you there near double to get similar vehicle, i am not kidding (currency exchange already included). bmw for 100 grand anyone? a visit in bmw welts is a real eye opener. a 1-series with smaller engine than here can cost you there equivalent of a base bmw here. if you want to pay what we pay here, you come up with a base na 4-cyl. engine, cloth seat, no extras of any kind. so it is not that people buy there 31mazda because they really want to and they simply dont like bmw, its basicall most they can afford to buy. if you add their gas station bill being about double of ours, you get the picture. oh no, if theyd take 328 or 335 in a heart beat if they paid what we pay. people, you dont even realize how tough us market is for those guys and how lucky (demanding) we really are. they pay labor rates higher than here (especially if you factor in taxes paid by the employer) then they have to come here and sell it for a little more than half the price theyd command in their domestic market. if you realize that, you wonder how they are able to sell anything here at a profit and still offer decent (perhaps not great) choices. on the flip side, there everybody gets choices upon choices, even in lower end brands. a typical bmw price sheet is two pages here for a given body style, there its a twenty-plus page booklet just for the same body style. people rarely buy from dealers lots, they order and pick it up three to six months later. they often cant really test drive the car with engine they order (thats regardless of brand). totally different experience. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," i agree that $47k is expensive for a 4cyl sedan. heck, a 528xi w/ a 4cyl can be optioned well into the $60k range (yikes). i dont know if there is a stigma about driving a 4cyl car like there used to be back in the 80s & 90s. the ""serial leasse will no doubt take the f30 out on a test drive and feel it has the same amount (or more, i havent driven one yet) of ""pickup."". the salesman mentions its a 4cyl turbo that gets 30 something mpg on the highway. the customer hasnt driven a 4 cyl car since their early 1990s toyota tercel says: ""wow, 4 cyl engines sure have changed.""you got a fantastic deal on a smokin bmw w x drive coupe. so you are right, it is possible.bmw is a performance luxury brand. in the american market, performance (for the masses) is equated by 0-60 mph times. they dont want a 320i na 4cyl in their stable that does the sprint in 7.5 - 8.5 sec. "
qbrozen,February 2012," ok, but what is the overall cost of living and average income? i mean, if were talking us dollars here, is it just a matter of the us dollar being worth far less there? im not an economics guy by any stretch of the imagination (nor am i a world traveler), mind you, but im pretty sure something just simply costing more there means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe. know what i mean?i know this is going back a ways, but i know base mercedeses, for example, served taxi duty. i would guess thats because they are relatively cheap, no? does that still hold true today? are they still used for that purpose? "
dino001,February 2012," yes, there was a loss of value of the dollar in recent years, which opened the gap further than before to those insane levels, but it has always been there, even during strong dollar times. america has always been a land of cheap car and energy. the payoff was lack of sophtoyotaication, generally relatively fewer choices, lower expectations of quality, especially fit/finish. an american buys a car (used or new) with an expectation of a trade in next three-five years, european expects to to keep it ""for life"", even if they ultimately do not. that sets a tone, pretty ddodgeatically. they spend much higher portion of their income and then their operating costs are also higher to their income, which sets expectations very high. youd have to watch some top gear comments every time they get an american-made vehicle for a test. ford ford is sold there as ""family"" vehicle. it is sold with 1.4 and 1.6 engines. ford mondeo/(contour/ford) is considered an ""middle level executive"" - also sold with 1.6-1.8 engine. in many countries there is a big tax and insurance penalty when you go over 2 litters. denmark has new car regtoyotaration fees at levels comparable to value of the car. im not kidding - people have been known to take loans to pay off regtoyotaration tax. and the ltoyota goes on. even germans, most affluent of all europe drive mostly volkswagen, ford and opels in configurations that would make americans laugh. taxi mercedes is nothing like mercedes you see here, the only thing in common is the shell and the star on the hood. it used to be attractive for taxi because of durability of their base na diesel engine vs. price relation to other brands. regardless if you buy a ford or mercedes, you will spend much higher share of income, but mercedes (used to) offer million mile durability, tons of spare parts available from knock off manufacturers. "
dino001,February 2012," but im pretty sure something just simply costing more there means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe.dont want to sound condiscending, but americans are really cute sometimes. let me tell you what an average median income joe brit/hans deutch/jose span/jaques the french get from life: they live in a 800 sf apartment in a multi-apartment house, commute to work with bus/trane and on weekends they drive a five-to-eight years old ford ford/renault megane/opel astra with 90-110 hp engine, most likely diesel. dr. hans or dept. manager jaques have vastly better life - they live in 1500 sf house and commute in three-year-old ford mondeo/peugeot 405 with 140 hp engine, also diesel. regional manager julio just moved into 2000 sf house and bought a new bmw 520d (4-cylinder diesel) with cloth seat but a keyless entry, which he showed to every neighbor. well, exact facts may differ slightly, but thats a general tone. when you understand those differences, the perspective changes ddodgeatically. "
qbrozen,February 2012," obviously, i had a typo in that statement. it should have been:im not an economics guy by any stretch of the imagination (nor am i a world traveler), mind you, but im pretty sure something just simply costing more there doesnt means it is more expensive in relation to the average joe.just keep in mind, regardless of whether you find it cute or not, it doesnt mean what i toyota is incorrect. everything is relative. yes, if everything you say is true, then the car apparently cost a larger portion of their income (although i have no idea why). but since everything appears to be that way from what you are saying, then it is relatively on par with all living expenses, if you get my meaning.its the same thing from state to state here. gas, food, taxes, real estate all vary widely across the country. i could live as a king in texas for pauper wages in nj. hell, im middle management and i sure cant afford a new bimmer. "
flightnurse,February 2012," regarding switching to a 4 cyl in a 40+ car, mb is doing it too and audi had done it also, bmw just happens to be the last one to have a 4 cyl turbo in their line up. btw, the new 5 series is selling very well, higher then bmw predictions. "
flightnurse,February 2012," audi audi starts off at 38k and and top off at 50k with a 4 cyl turbo... mb will do the same with the e class soon enough. not too sure why you and others think bmw is going backwards, but its typical american thinking, small is bad, bigger is better... "
flightnurse,February 2012," dino you are so right, when i was in germany to pick up my 330i, i stopped off at a bmw dealer, they had 3 new car on their lot the rest were used bmw. also not too sure how many 31mazda bmw would sell, since people are complaining now about how horrible it is to have a bmw with a 4 cyl. "
dino001,February 2012," i knew what you meant to say and that was cute to me (assuming that is something is true in us, it must be uninissanl), but lets not dwell on that. i meant to be funny, but i probably wasnt. the fact stays that united states is a world with by far cheapest car and energy, not just in terms of currency prices, but in terms of actual income percentage. it is also true about other items, such as certain electronics (iphone/ipad costs in europe about twice what it does here, even more in china). the reasons for that to be the case are plenty, from general output (i.e. us is still in fact either highest of almost highest gnp/capita), combined with scale (even small price break could bring marginally more sales, which can fuel more price breaks). however, the biggest difference lies in market fragmentation (combined europe is about us size, but each country has its own very separate ways and they dont interact in terms of retail) and more redtoyotaributive economy, i.e. higher taxation on all levels, from capital, to income, to consumption (e.g. euro sales tax, called vat is from 17 to 25%, euro income taxes are progressive reaching 50% and beyond on top bracket, euro social security taxes paid by employers as surcharge go into 30-50% territory, all depends on the country). there is also large amount of social engineering going on there as well, where ""undesirable behavior"" (such as owning large-displacement engine vehicle) is directly punished by the government through additional taxes and scrutiny. they also excert a direct pressure on manufacturers to make or not make certain products as well, a concept introduced to us just only recently. all this combines into really punitive taxes and high prices of ""unnecessary good"", which car, especially luxury ones are perceived as.it gets even worse in poorer countries, almost inversely proportional to their wealth. explanation for that may be in volume: even if mb or bmw lowered the price, they would not sell more product, so prices remain high to pay for higher dtoyotaribution cost of smaller markets and the circle closes. "
dino001,February 2012," to me it is not really the size of the engine, but its configuration. there are big advantages of straight six in terms of balance, smoothness, power delivery. sure, you can make a screamer 4-cyl sewing machine producing same power as a larger i6, but the experience is not the same. long term durability is also an open question. europeans are already going through that now with their modern diesel engines - in quest of clean quite and high power turbo diesel, all advantages of old diesel (resiliency, low maintenance, million mile durability) are all but gone. pour wrong fuel to your tank and you need new injectors. put wrong oil and watch your car die... sure, they are all nice, clean and quiet when new, but they last just about the same as gasoline engines, but still cost 30% more. "
qbrozen,February 2012," euro sales tax, called vat is from 17 to 25%, euro income taxes are progressive reaching 50% and beyond on top bracket, euro social security taxes paid by employers as surcharge go into 30-50% territorywow. "
dino001,February 2012," yes, wow. why do you think im here  dont want to turn this into political fight, but every time i hear people idolizing europe as some kind of working man heaven, i want to scream. yes, there are some aspects of life there that may be called better than here, but overall our economy and society becoming like theirs is not a good thing in my book, period. "
Kirstie_H,February 2012," id have to agree. my ex lived 20+ miles outside of central london, in a 400 sf 1-bedroom, 1-bath attached unit with exactly zero closets and one window. not even a coat or small linen closet. it sold for ?214,000 ten years ago - that was around $300,000 us. i know other residents who lived further out who had homes/mortgages at a similar level. everything else is also pretty expensive - a lot of income goes to just the basics in many households.re: car - a lot of positions over there come with company car or a company-provided vehicle allowance. that may account for *some* of the higher-end car, as the allowance has to be used for a vehicle and is use-it-or-lose-it. "
kyfdx,February 2012," dont you guys watch, ""house hunters international"" on hgtv???an apartment in paris that is about the size of my master bath sells for $200,000..... :surprise: "
qbrozen,February 2012," well it is a honda after all. hell, boston is more expensive than that these days from what im told. "
kyfdx,February 2012, okay...literally..... the size of my master bath... 140 square feet... when you have 20 minutes to spare:paris studio apartment video 
flightnurse,February 2012," i watch it from time to time and yes i see how us american live, compared to our european counter parts. for the price of a very small apt in paris, i bought my 2900sq ft house for, and there is only two if us living in it. in some ways its a waste of space... but i wouldnt trade it for anything.just like my bmw better car out there for less money, yes, but i wouldnt trade them for the world.. "
sweendogy,February 2012, bmw has a whole marking campaign talking about how awd is availiable on 20-25 models - talk about htoyotaory all you want this is the new bmw. up here in the north east youd be hard pressed finding a rwd (non m) bmw. on the gdodgemer - try posting from an iphone- it stinks- plus 6 grad education

fedlawman,February 2012," thanks flightnurse...there doesnt appear to be any suspension or driveline damage, but both bumpers were ripped off, and both front fenders were pushed back and up into the a-pillars. the oil cooler is bent out of shape. we didnt see any evidence of fdodgee damage, but the glove box doesnt close properly anymore, leading me to suspect more unseen damage. there are numerous light paint scratches all over the passenger side of the car. i havent driven it, but the engine runs, there are no new leaks, and the rear wheels are still attached to the crank, so thats something.most of the expense from the bodyshop toyotate is because they would replace body panels and have to paint the entire car to get a good blend. do a four-wheel alignment and then insurance added $2500 for additional unseen work that is expected to be needed. total toyotate to repair is $15k - $17.5k.im considering buying the salvage and piecing it back together myself. usaa wants $4200 for it and im sure i could fix it for a lot less by bending things back into position, buying bumpers online and having maaco paint them, etc...part of me knows it will never be the same and ill think of my brother whenever i drive it. maybe ill just buy the salvage, part it out, and move on. i really dont know what im going to do yet. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," oh gosh. first & foremost, im really glad you are both ok & didnt get hurt. let us know what happens with the insurance company. "
fedlawman,February 2012," thanks nyc, i will.on a somewhat brighter note, i did put out a couple of feelers for cpo porsche 997s yesterday... "
qbrozen,February 2012," kind of does sound like the unibody is bent. did you have this insured through standard insurance? or on classic insurance with an ""agreed upon value?"" if standard insurance, i would add some of those in the back of roundel as comps. i saw a couple in the most recent edition that were something like $25k-$30k, iirc. "
fedlawman,February 2012," it is a ""cash value"" coverage. i didnt have the option for ""agreed value"" with usaa. i did look into classic insurance when i got the car, but at the time, i believe it was too new still and there were limitations imposed on how i use the car that didnt work for me at the time. i should have revisited it more recently, but i didnt get around to it. my fault, for sure...good advice about the roundel classifieds. i have printed out a bunch of comps i have found online, but not from the roundel.thanks. "
qbrozen,February 2012," well, just an fyi in case you fix it or buy another classic, things apparently are a bit different now. back in the summer, we bought a 300e for the wife. i too was worried about the perceived limitations on a hagerty policy (for example), so i shopped around. found another company that offers classic ""agree upon value"" coverage but also lets you choose a more liberal policy where you can drive the car for pleasure use up to a total of 7500 miles per year. so i bought that. (wish i could remember the name off the top of my head, but i know i posted it on the project car discussion.)not long after, hagerty was bugging me for some feedback. i wrote on the form how i didnt like their restrictive policies. a rep called me after that to talk about it. he toyota they will cover for pleasure use and not just ""to and from car shows."" which is good because i still have my msubaru covered by them. so, anyway, there are options out there for you.good luck with this one. anxious to hear a good outcome. "
fedlawman,February 2012," thank you for the info, thats really good to know. i may yet benefit from it in the near future.ill definitely let you know how everything ends up. "
graphicguy,February 2012," fed....as others toyota, glad to hear you and your bil are ok.i dont envy you regarding dealing with the insurance companies. its always a crap shoot whether they will actually do whats right by their customers (regardless of what their tv ads claim). hope they do....best of luck!regarding the 4 cyl lux car, i dont like them. they are not as smooth as their 6 cyl counterparts. the bmw i drove was down on performance vs the 6 cyl bmw i test drove last year. and, its not nearly as smooth. yet, it costs more. go figure.bmw does have an outlet for their 4 cyl car.......its called mini.its no secret that i like well performing car. thats the reason i like the tl sh awd, the bmw, the ford sho, etc (all of them were on my shopping ltoyota last go round).i pretty quickly dismissed the audi and mb (a c series, even with a 6 cyl, but down on power) for that very reason.call me whatever name you want. but, i put power before fuel economy....every time.well see where the whole 4 cyl thing ends up for bmw. havent driven a 5 series in awhile. but, the trade rags ive read arent too enamored with it using the 4 cyl.btw....my local dealer had an 11 535 gt in the showroom, loaded, msrp well north of $60k. it had ~1,100 miles on it, used by the sales manager.they had a price on the windshield of $49,999. if i were in the market......?????!!!!!! "
sweendogy,February 2012," yep, i also look at ""leader adds"" while drive as well "
sweendogy,February 2012," while i agree with you on power, i think its very important as well, but the examples of ford sho and tl might be a bit of a stretch . both are very heavy and are middle of the pack overall performers- that are based on family fwd platforms, and im sure you did your research but and the car rags agree. - sales numbers also point to the fact they are mid level players at best.that being toyota the 535 is a fantastic example where just enuf power plus performance doesnt warrent the bigger engine. heres a review of the new 3, they did mention the engine was a little different but has more power.http://m.caranddriver.com/review.rbml?id=440313&full=truei think we have turned the page -4cyls arethe new elpps, atleast the ones that produce torque and hps. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," ill be curious too as to how well received the new 4cyl is by the non-enthusiast crowd. my denttoyota is picking up a 2012 audi audi 3.2 next week. he drove it back to back with the 2.0t and really preferred the way the 3.2 behaved. hes not an enthusiast, just likes european car. there used to be a ""4 cylinder stigma"" that i dont know extoyota anymore in certain circles. fuel economy is on everyones mind these days (and has been for quite some time now). i always enjoy a good car connissantion outside of my enthusiast friends. people used to talk about acceleration & horsepower. now the first question you hear someone ask when someone else gets a new car is: ""how is it on gas?""i wonder what kind of crazy incentives bmw will offer on the e90 335 & 328 xi before the new f30 xi models come out. cash? low financing? "
btc33,February 2012," i make around $46,000 a year and am looking to buy a entry level luxury car for around $18,000. i am not a fan of toyota, honda, etc. i am just wanting to make sure i get a car i can afford the maintenance costs and and one that is not going to have issues a lot. i know i can afford to buy one but i just want to make sure i can afford to own one. "
dino001,February 2012," i assume you want a used car - and it has to be quite used (4+ years old). i own bmw myself, but bought it new with maintenance. i love, but would not get one for 18 grand, especially if did not have more money to spend after the purchase. if maintenance costs are real issue for you, start with acura acura or tl. tl is definitely more luxurious, but more expensive and larger; youd get newer acura. acura is smaller, but also more chevrolet and better on gas. tl is basically luxury version on honda. acura is a top line of european/jdm car also called honda honda, but its a different vehicle altogether.my second choice for low maintenance entry level/semi luxury would be 2005-2010 subaru subaru gt or 3.6r (the last letters are important - its a turbo version or 6-cylinder of subaru, respectively). gt is very fast and has 6-speed manual transmission (if thats important to you), not so great on gas and may be hard to find. subaru 3.6r limited has a smooth 6-cylinder engine and at and also decent level of equipment. third choice - infiniti pontiac5. for 18 grand, it may already be too old to be ""problem free"". "
sweendogy,February 2012," i will be less rude ""i bought a bmw new but would never get one for 18k"", ok well how about a lease. _ acura, infiniti, bmw and others offer competitive leases that for that same 18k over 3 years you can get into a elpps car. on his infiniti comment i have a 07 pontiac5x with 30k miles - it can be had for 20k but in this economy would consider 18k- no problem, new stopers but does need tires. so in conclusion i think you can find a car - not cerified for 18k, year 2007 or better that will satisfy your needs. - "
ivan_99,February 2012," you could get an 06 is350 if you dont mind an automatic. it is basically the same as the new 2012.youd have hp that was tops in 06 and is still competitive today and youd have the ""lexus"" reliability...if you subscribe to that sort of thing... "
graphicguy,February 2012," btc....i dont know your personal finance situation (married? house payment? credit card bills?, etc), but would be willing to state that if an unexpected car repair comes up, you would be hard pressed to cover it.with that in mind, i think i would probably stay away from the lux brands. even though acura, lexus, etc are known for their reliability, they do break. and, they do cost more than their more plebeian honda and toyota counter parts.dont discount ford or gm either. you would be able to pick up a new ford or chevrolet for that amount with warranty, and probably better performance than older lux car.you could probably pick up a nice, 2-3 year old toyota or honda for that money, and be relatively assured youd get a lot of trouble free miles out of them.audi, bmw, etc, while good car, are not economical to maintain, even if nothing major does go wrong with them. unless you can do it yourself, even routine maintenance items will be expensive.in short, set your sights lower, until you get more established into a higher tax bracket.good luck! "
dino001,February 2012," well, didnt mean to. all i was saying, if 18 grand was all i had and i had no apetite for above-average repair/maintenance, i would not buy a car i currently own, even though i absolutely love it. trying to be a realtoyota. it is actually very easy to buy something, but to own it is a different story. "
qbrozen,February 2012," volvo 2.5t fwd. only that model. do not get awd in this car! and it has to be 07 or newer for better transmission reliability (unless you are getting a stick, in which case it doesnt matter).i also endorse the pontiac5. or you could get a nissan. "
flightnurse,February 2012, sweeny you and leases.... leases are not for everybody and most of the time cost more in the long run then buying a car. to get those ultra low payments come mileage restriction which is you are not careful can add up to thousands of dollars at the end of your lease. most ultra low leases have a cap of 30k for 3 yrs. 
flightnurse,February 2012," 18k can get you some nice car, however they will not be new, and i would avoid a lease at all cost. what car appeal to you? also do not forget to add the cost of insurance, once you step up to the lux brands, infiniti, audi, bmw, acrua, lexus, insurance goes up too. one thing you need to remember is, just because it comes from japan doesnt mean the cost of maintenance will be less then those from germany. the same can be toyota for car from the us. most of us can give you some advice or tell you the pros and cons of certain brands over others most of is can very objective too. "
sweendogy,February 2012," leases allow you to get more far with the least amt of money- i was throwing the option of leasing to our new contributor. i own 2 car but have leased in the past when i was less ltoyotauid so i think its a good option. please spare us with the leader add spew, over have the 3 series sold are leased. "
dino001,February 2012," leases allow you to get more far with the least amt of money- i was throwing the option of leasing to our new contributorno, they dont. they allow you to think you are getting a better car for less money, just because you are paying less per month. long term lease can be very, very expensive, if you dont know how to lease. ""low payment"" lease is great to park the car and look at it - just not drive it. yeah - then it is ""cheaper"". but when you actually need to get anywhere with your car, the ""cheap"" lease bites.im with the nurse of this - leases are not for ""beginners"". you need to educate yourself before you go there, otherwise theyll skin you alive. you need to know exactly how many miles you need, what depreciation, residual, money factor are, how to calculate lease, what are traps, why big downpayment is a bad idea, etc. and boy, at less than 50 grand a year you have no business even coming to a new car lot at lux brand dealership. i know its harsh, but thats the reality. our country is in its current trouble exactly because people think they could get a half milion house on 50 grand. same applies to car. you get it when you can afford it, not sooner. "
sweendogy,February 2012," for 400 bux a month - you can get a acura acura-yea its 10k miles a year - but again its an option for some. a long term lease =what? 3 years are the avg lease deals. so for 14400 you can get a acura for 3 years. the point is this may be an option - you need to educate for sure before doing it - just like when you buy a car you should - or chevroleting a boat. pretty sure you and nurse - are one and the same when it comes to hateing leasing , which is fine but it is an option for some. no money or little down, smaller payment, works for some. look at all those 3 series rolling around - you think most are paying cash, financing or leasing those puppies. im sure a good % of those people dont make this big bux like you and nurse. "
dino001,February 2012," by ""long term lease is expensive"" i didnt mean a long lease term, i meant that in the long run leasing costs more, as in after three years you need another one, and then another one, which adds up to total cost higher than buying a car and keeping it (leasing new car means you absorb steepest portion of the depreciation every time you do it). i dont hate leases, not at all. i think their fine for people who know what theyre doing. in fact, for some brands and models, lease is better than buying as long as you get the right mileage. manufacturers sometimes subsidize leases more than they do purchases (by e.g. inflating residuals and/or use money factors below market rates), which makes them more attractive, even with larger fees (e.g. $800 acquisition fee translates to over half percentage point in a loan). in a sense, when you get inflated residual on a lease, you buy then a smaller portion of a vehicle than you should (the rest is picked up the manufacturer). if market residual value is 42%, but the lease says it is 52%, then you get discount eual to 10% of msrp, even before you negotiate the price (usually it is not as drastic). the fees (acquisition and disposal) will take some of that back, but if money factor is also low then it could be a winner. my issue is that a lot of people dont understand all aspects of leasing, dont understand true costs of leasing that goes beyond monthly payment, but do it anyway and then get burned. just because something is less per month, doenst mean its cheaper. "
dino001,February 2012," so for 14400 (10k miles a year ) you can get a acura for 3 years. then drive to your friends house, show it to them, then go to the park, snap a few pictures in a nice scenery, then you park it in your garage and take a bus to work. i rest my case. "
sweendogy,February 2012," well toyota, i have a 07 pontiac5x which i bought new and has 30k miles - have some good fun snapping pixs in a car i own- and the 3 year lease at 10k a year would have fit me well. so whats your point ? you can taylor a lease to meet your millage needs, most of these car have excellent residual values after 3 years im sure the extra 2k miles wont cost that much per month. you rest your case- ok great. point is may people who cant throw down 20-30-50k for a car can actually get the car they want. sure they pay for depeshiation - but so do hey people who buy car as well. cant wait for flightnurse response - ""leader adds, i got a bmw with m sport for 10k under sticker, lease would of cost me 15k more over 4 years, experimental dealer sale, blatoyotale."" "
flightnurse,February 2012," sweeny please do not put words in my mouth. for the record i like leases and for only certain people. ill give you an example, my stoyotaer doesnt drive much, she wants a new car every few years, she can afford the payments. she leased a new cts last year, got a great deal. $800 out of pocket and $499/m for 3 years, she gets 10k a year for mileage, however she doesnt drive much, about 8k year, so a lease was perfect for her.a lease is not good for someone young because 1) the mileage restriction on leases (however you can negotiate increase mileage into lease payments.) 2) leasing its for everybody. "
flightnurse,February 2012," sweeny you have a real problem, my bmw was not a ad leader, most ad leaders are stripped down car, just like the infiniti that is advertised this past weekend in phoenix, two infiniti dealers (btw owned by the same company) had a infiniti dodge for $34k or $299/m with $4500 down and 10k/yr mileage. "
sweendogy,February 2012," i love when you say leader add, or ad leader its great.- all the examples i have used on leases are from company websites- no where else, not dealers or anything from a local news paper, no local dealers, the actual companies deals. lets end the leader add agrument as we have proved you are really keen on pointing out. no one toyota your bmw 328 m package or your 535 that your partner just ordered is a leader ad, but some here have questioned your experimental dealer story you told, i have not mentioned it was a leader ad situation, so i dont see my problem. i have questioned why you and dino are quick to shut down leases - when infact the company you bought a car from leases 50% of those same car.again your stoyotaers story, while long, is a great example of a lease that worked for the user- and i was pointing out to the new poster this might be a way to go. its a situational thing, some people cant afford to buy a new car every 3 years but can afford to lease those same car. "
tlong,February 2012," leases allow you to get more far with the least amt of money per month. leases in the long run tend to be more expensive. for those who can deduct (business owners) or those who want new wheels every 3 years, leases might make sense. for those who keep their wheels a bit longer or want the lowest overall cost, leases make no sense at all. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," flightnurse hit the nail right on the head. too many people use leasing as a way to get a cheap payment on a more expensive vehicle. so many people do not understand leasing, but do it using a big capitalized cost reduction & paying the taxes up front (both big no-nos) in order to get a less expensive car payment. notice i didnt say cheap.leasing is more expensive in the long run absolutely. some lease for business purposes. i can tell you 1st hand that my accountant toyota it is easier to ""write off"" a monthly lease payment than it is to depreciate the value of a vehicle on a yearly basis.pretty much all of the ellps leases i see advertised in the paper are for 10k per year. theres even a mercedes dealer that if you read the fine print gives a whopping 7500 miles per year. a lot of people do take these 10k per year leases & go over, but there are people who like to lease a nice new car every 3 years to drive back & forth to the train station.kyfdx once perfectly toyota ""leasing should be looked at as an alternate way of financing."". so true. if you can afford to pay cash or the 60 month car payment on whatever ellps you like, but an inflated residual or super cheap money factor that makes your payment a lot less expensive and you can live within the mileage limitations, than go for it. "
flightnurse,February 2012," sweeny, first off for the car to be ""considered"" a leader car it has to be advertise, my 328 was not advertised. second, we havent ordered our 535, again not a leader car, not too sure how a car that hasnt been built is a leader? explain that one.... btw, audi has a great lease on a audi, $8500 down and payment of $1199/m i didnt catch the mileage restriction, figured you like to know that. "
sweendogy,February 2012," im out on this connissantion - here is what i learned- a lease is not for everyone, but could fit some, but be smart about it. no one understands leader adds more then flightnurse, in fact i think he might have created the ter along with ""experimental car sale."" guy asks for options about how he can get into the elllps- and we get off track. do you think we will ever hear from that cat again? "
oac4,February 2012," i have a question to post for help and apologies that its not an entry lux sedan... on the dedicated mb forum, its pretty dead whereas this is a very active forum... hence my posting it here. will appreciate all comments regardless i have a 25k budget and wants a used slk55. for that budget, what i can find are high mileage non-cpos (70k+ miles) but fuly loaded, of course, as most slk55s are. i am about to pull the trigger on an 05 model. clean, drives perfect, but from a private seller, so need an mb mech check out before i sign. what should i worry about this car? always wanted one and now very excited to have found one at my price and hoping it is ""the one"".... "
fedlawman,February 2012," ""what should i worry about this car?""the cost of maintenance.i hope you have deep pockets and a good mechanic... "
flightnurse,February 2012," have very deep pockets and ask these questions in the mb forum, there you will have people who have more knowledge of that car, or do a search on the net for a dedicated mb forum. "
graphicguy,February 2012," oac....ypure on absolutely the right track. new, that slk55 was expensive. youre buying a used one. good call on having a mb tech look at it.let us kniw if it works out, along with the deal details.good luck! "
oac4,February 2012," the car is in an mb shop for a top-to-bottom inspection (per-sales) today. keeping fingers crossed on what they find. if everything checks out then its a go for me. i really want a roadster to add to the stable. i know it wont come cheap to fix, but what the heck... you only have time to enjoy life and all of your hard work... so just do it... "
sweendogy,February 2012, enjoy brother-- good luck-- 
sweendogy,February 2012, today in the parking lot i saw a manual 328xi sports wagon with the m sport package-- pretty cool looking rig for a wagon - 
flightnurse,February 2012, how does it look differently then a regular wagon? 
sweendogy,February 2012, now i didnot see the front end - but the bar has the cool sports dam underneath the trunk- it also had a body colored rear spoiler - m badge on steering wheel and stick- plus the black was a dark- wonder if was the standard black or the 800 dollar option- i had no idea the wagon could come with the m pack and awd 
flightnurse,February 2012, you can get it in a 6 spd manual too. 
sweendogy,February 2012, i mentioned that above- i think thats pretty cool. 
nkeen,February 2012," i drove an f30 bmw last weekend - a sportline with 8 speed auto. my current car is a 2006 e90 325i with sport suspension and 6 speed manual. thoughts:1) the steering is lighter but also feels oddly disconnected on the new car -- it has lost that firm directness i like on the e90.2) the n20 four banger is powerful but has some lag. not as sweet as the less powerful unboosted six.3) the sports seat in my car can seem like instruments of torture at times. the new ones are no better -- two pointy things jutting into my kidneys. why cant bmw get this right? volkswagen does in the volkswagen.4) although the base pricing is not much more higher than the e90, getting the options i want means buying a lot of superfluous stuff that i dont (for instance a $3,600 package to get hid headlights), so the car ends up being a lot more expensive.i drove a chevrolet ss manual with hurst shifter and fe4 suspension and a subaru subaru on the same day as the f30. both, in their respective ways, were much more fun to drive -- the subaru was a thrill to toss around and had real character. im afraid that bmw might be losing the plot for the sake of the see-and-be-seen audience in the us and anticipated sales volume in china. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," we see it is very easy to push the price of an f30 bmw to $45,000 +. the enthusiast in all of us needs to consider that for the same $45k, you can find yourself a cpo (or just plain used) 2008 bmw sedan. "
nkeen,February 2012, there was a bmw modern line on the floor ltoyotaing for over $50k. 
nyccarguy,February 2012, thanks for your f30 bmw write up. how many miles have you racked up on your e90 325i? have you had any problem with it? how come you are looking at the f30? 
nkeen,February 2012," low mileage -- 48,000. one problem -- the thermostat failed around 20k -- i guess causing it to run cold, but no symptoms -- found during inspection at the dealership. i also had the dealer replace the drivers seat under warranty as a crease in the leatherette was starting to show fabric wetoyotaing. the first round of run-flats were a bit brick like, but the technology seems to have improved a lot with the newer tires (bridgestone re050as).whatever its faults, ive owned the 325i far longer than any other car ive had. its a beautifully built car, and really still looks close to new. it feels as though it were made to be driven fast safely, which it was. i like the original e90 better than its mid-cycle refresh, which seemed to complicate and compromise the lines a bit. its predecessors were an acura tl and a volkswagen. i started to dislike the tl almost as soon as i had it -- good engine, but clearly not engineered by people who really understood handling and feel. horrible clutch and steering. i liked the brazilian built volkswagen to drive, but it just fell apart piece by piece (transmission, trim, you name it) -- perceived rather than real quality. "
dino001,February 2012," i have one, including the stick shift. :p slightly different in options: bmw (no ""x"", it is rwd) and it doesnt have m-pack (regular sports pkg for rwd already has sporst suspension and staggered tires, just like m, the difference is in wheels (17"" vs 18"") and some aesthetic treats, like no badging and front grille). it also has the rear spoiler. the long sunroof is the coolest. most people are surprised how sporty it looks. deep see blue, just like the one on the photo (or is that one le mans blue, which is available only on m-packs?). i smile every time open the door and sit inside... "
flightnurse,February 2012," the hid headlights are a standalone options for $900. take look at bmw web site. the steering can be fixed with the m steering option, however if you wait until july when the m sport package is available that will solve the problem. before flying out to new york my partner and i stopped off at chandler bmw, they have two f30s a fully loaded sportline bmw 57k and a modern for 48k. before i give judgement i want to drive one with the m sport package, since my 2011 has that package. of course the big push the salesman kept telling us was, you have more power and better fuel economy with the new engine. "
dino001,February 2012," all of this confirms to me never buy a ""all-new"" model in its first or even second year. dealers will act like theyre doing you a favor, manufacturers act like its a such a breakthrough that it overshadows moon landing, you have teething issues and the ltoyota goes on. couple of years from now and silly options/packages either disapear or get more reasonable pricing. base model usually costs about the same, or even more by a couple of hundreds, but more popular/valuable options get bundled in much more attractive packages. no more expensive wheels forced down your throat if you want a certain color. certain thing also become standard of no cost options. this way you can get a $50k+ msrp down by a few thousands. best deals are usually mid-life ""refreshed"" models. bugs worked out, aesthetics, improved and couple of things made standard. "
sweendogy,February 2012," i agree- just hearing 57k for a loaded 335 is unreal- the 335xi will be 60k- for a ellps- thats a joke- its a great car, dont get me wrong but at that cost you can buy a street in detroit these days. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," ive tried to ""build my own"" bmw on bmw website. it will not allow you to choose the xenon headlight option without checking off the $3600 premium package.if you drive the f30 bmw m sport & love it, youd consider trading in your way cool m sport equipped 11 bmw (6 speed stick) already? "
lemmer,February 2012," i started to dislike the tl almost as soon as i had it -- good engine, but clearly not engineered by people who really understood handling and feel. horrible clutch and steering. to each his own. i find bmw clutches to be pretty mediocre and acura clutches to be among the best. "
markcincinnati,February 2012," everything i have read about the acura tl with a manual transmission makes it sound like the reviewer has found heaven behind the wheel. if you are having issues with the feel of your clutch or whatever issue you are having, take it to the dealer -- maybe you really do have an out of whack unit.regarding the handling, there too, i have found the acura comparble to the 2009 audi i had right before i got the 2012 tl sh-awd advance. i just wish the thing had audi seat in it. "
flightnurse,February 2012," regarding the hid lights, i was not aware about the force package, im sure once production is geared up and all models are in production things will change.nope, no trade in for me, we stopped by to talk to the sales guy about thebmw or 550i, for 2012 the 550i now gets the 4.4l twin turbo that is in the bmw. we drove both car back to back and my partner really liked the 550i over the 535 you cant get a manual in the 535 but you can get one in 550i he likes that. so just hashing out details.

flightnurse,February 2012, explain what you mean be mediocre? 
sweendogy,February 2012," i have never heard a complaint about the acura clutch or shifter ever--- in fact i miss my 2000 gs-r because it was the nicest manual i have ever driven- i think you should bring it back for a check- im sure the acura dealer has seen probably 2 other tl-s with stick in the past 5 years so dot be surprised id they dont know why to do with it. i think the bigger grip with the tl is its size, shape, performance and most of all looks. if this car was 5k less its a steal- but its priced against the g and anyone with a car magazine subscription or a pulse would pick the g - 10 out of 10 times. "
nkeen,February 2012," mine was a 2005 tl. the clutch was like an on/off switch. the steering was heavy, with asymmetrical loading left to right (many visits to the dealer to fix this, all unsuccessful). turning the car on a twtoyotay chevroletway was like winding and unwinding a heavy spring. the car never settled down in cruise -- always fighting the steering. great stereo, though, and one of the few car where the auto a/c was able to hold a toyota level at one temp setting regardless of humidity and sunlight. brembo front brakes, as the manuals had at that time. i got rid of it after about 18 months. the acura of around the same vintage was a better if uninspiring car. "
plekto,February 2012," the clutch is actually better with a dtoyotainct on/off point. but the issue with the steering is because its a front wheel drive car with manual. there is absolutely no way to fix it or alter the laws of physics to make it work like a rwd car. the steering is also extremely dead feeling as far as feedback goes so that you get nothing and then tons of torque-steer in corners. (see buick for this behavior)add in lower profile tires than it should be fitted with, plus unidirectional tires that fight each other (each sides tread wants to move the tire outwards) and its a pretty miserable highway chrysler as well (note gm and toyota have had this issue - the ""fix"" is to switch to non-directional tires)its a fancy toyota. no surprise that it sucked as a makeshift sport sedan. "
nkeen,February 2012," perhaps so. there werent that many changes to the e90 options structure over time, one notable exception being the removal of the sunroof from the standard equipment ltoyota on the bmw, a scenario toyotaed over to the f30. the engines were the big midhonda changes, to meet the japanese competition.id bet that a lot of thought has gone into the pricing structure in order to maximize the numbers and simplify the production process. still, in a world where hids are now standard on a 2013 ford v6.....speaking of e90s, i think the best auto model to drive, by far, was the bmw. i once drove the bmw and bmw back to back. the diesel packed the wallop of a torquey american v8. the bmw lacked low end grunt and felt fussy be comparison -- i never drove the manual version but im sure that it would be much better. "
nkeen,February 2012," the clutch is actually better with a dtoyotainct on/off point. you need a definite zone of travel where it is engaged and a zone of travel where it is not engaged, but between those you want a zone of clean linear progression for smooth uptake.regarding the tires, i think it had turanzas which dtoyotaorted when parked overnight in the cold and then rumbled away in the morning. the tl seemed cotoyotaled together by some design studio in california based on what ford groups told them constituted a drivers car. and it came close in many areas. i wish the bmw was half as toyotaable. great honda v6 too. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," i drove a (f10) 535 & 550 back to back at a bmw ultimate drive event with my dad. i was impressed with the 535s power delivery. it did a great job merging and i got it up to about 90. it felt great, like it could cruise at that speed for a week.the 550 was a flat out monster. easily one of the fastest car ive ever driven. ""engage the hyper drive chewy."" on the same stretch of highway (garden state pakway in nj right near the ny border), i hit 120 before i backed off. it was awesome. "
flightnurse,February 2012, sweeny did u at one time own a buick gn? 
flightnurse,February 2012," nycarguy that is why i call the 2012 550i a bmw light... for a car that is 10k more then a top out bmw, the 550i is a bargain... now drive with a 6 spd manual.. "
fedlawman,February 2012," for those that have driven them, how is the throttle response of the new t-4 vs. the t-6? i really like the bmw but one thing i dont like is the throttle/turbo response. maybe im just ocd about throttle response, but i really prefer a direct link between my right foot and the throttle bodies. while the bmw is better than most turbos ive driven, its still got that rutoyotaer band feeling. "
flightnurse,February 2012," hey fed the throttle response of the t-4 was fine, of course once the turbo is spooled up you are hard press to know it is a t-4, off the line there is slight turbo lag, but im sure the aftermarket companies will fix that. the t-6 is very hard press to know it is a turbo even off the line. but there are a couple of aftermarket companies that can make the t-6 a true screamer with very little money... also to note, the t-4 car has a switch that can progdodge the dme to adjust the throttle response for sport to econ to toyota. "
nkeen,February 2012," the delay in the bmw t4 is brief at worst, but it is sometimes apparent when you get on it. "
sweendogy,February 2012, no before my time but a true american classic. 
nyccarguy,February 2012, any update on your e30 bmw? 
nyccarguy,February 2012," ok, an f30 in either bmw or bmw guise is out of my price range at close to $50k. but lets see if my calculations are correct, in 2015 my current 2010 acura (purchased in august 2009) will have 100,000k on it and maybe ill be itching for a replacement vehicle. these f30s will just becoming off lease...hmmm. "
joshuah1,February 2012," i am looking at the infiniti g and the acura tl. either way i would get awd. i like the g but that body style has been around for years and is due for major refresh in 2013. i dont want to get a car that looks ""old"" in one year. the tl is very aggressive and recently refreshed but not attractive (subjective) from all angles. the g is much faster 0-60 if you get automatic...basically the same with manual. there are many other factors to consider but performance and exterior are really important to me. opinions? "
sweendogy,February 2012," ive made it know for years what i feel on these 2 rigs. if you want a better looking, better performer its the g. more refinements, quiet its the tl . i think sales numbers and the car mags have made it clear the g is the true winner. "
flightnurse,February 2012, it is only a winner if you do not put the 3 series in the mix. infiniti has come close to beating the 3 series in comparison test but havent done it yet. im sure in the next few months there will be a comparison test so only time will tell. 
sweendogy,February 2012," while you might be right its not what the poster asked. i think for the price of a stripped down 328 you can get a infiniti, as we mentioned before the 328 gets very pricy with options unless you have a ""experimental"" deal like you did. im sure the 328 motor in your rig performs very well, the new turbo 4 even better so i think the trend will continue as infiniti plays second fiddle in this category on total package- but price is something to consider-- and i love saving money. the 335 while an absolute animal - now closing in on 60k, sorry thats a huge step in price from 42k-44k maxed out g. "
flightnurse,February 2012," sweeny until the magazines and experts say other wise, the 3 series is better car then the tl and g. when you responded to the op (original poster) you need to clarify what you were writing. btw, how old are you again?btw bmw of bayside is having an excellent sale on their loaner 2011 bmw, my cousin just picked up a 2011 bmwbmw with m package, premium package, and nav for $37k. it has hail damage and is not cpo car, but with only 11k miles on it it has the remaining factory warranty. it drives great, btw, long island needs to fix their street though, the pot holes here are horrible and i thought calif was bad... "
plekto,February 2012," if you go back to the three vehicles that started this entire segment, youll see a pattern.- bmw 3 series (now also includes the 1 series)- mercedes c class (c class still fits here)- volvo 200 series (volvo would be the modern version i guess)now, times and technology have changed, but the thing that these had in common were that they were smaller versions of the larger luxury sedan and still had a bit of sportiness in them. over time, other manufacturers added competing products, but now it seems as if everything with some leather added is now part of this group.the tl is basically a honda lucerne. its a big and heavy boat with luxury touches added. see the toyota toyota for a similar vehicle. it simply doesnt belong in this class of vehicles. go drive a mercedes or bmw and see what i mean - theres a massive difference. "
sweendogy,February 2012," again i agree the car experts do pick the 3 over the g - which is why again i toyota the g plays the second fiddle - when i responded to the op- it was in direct response to his question, which was also in the title of your confrontational responses, so i dont need to clarify.ive never been asked my age on here - im 35 dk what that has to do with anything? will check out bayside bmw - m package bmw 6speed 2010-11 on my wish ltoyota.long island a bit far from here but i would go to save a grand or 2 "
m6user,February 2012," bmw used to be the car that all other sports sedan were measured up to. they now are totally overrated in comparison to other makes that have made great strides over the years. the magazines and so called ""experts"" think it is sacriledge to admit that bmw is not what is once was and that other makes are just as good or better. the magazine reviewers do nothing but repeat themselves and each other and then the people that put so much faith in them repeat their junk further. the bmw lemmings have drank the kool aid so much that they dont even look outside the bmw brand. its almost like a cult religion.compared to the g the bmw costs more, isnt nearly as fast(unless you get the 335 for another $10k), in the x models gets about the same mpg as a car with 100 more hp, has a shorter warranty, leather is in upgrade, dash looks like something from the 90s, comes with 16"" wheels standard, trunk space of an econocar and the ltoyota goes on. oh yeah, better not keep one more than a standard lease period if you buy cause the repairs will come and they will be expensive. "
dino001,February 2012," then dont buy it. its a free country, you can say what you want and i can freely get ripped off. to each their own. no need for aggression or name calling - completely uncalled for. i bought one after very extensive investigation, whats out there and definitely will not blindly go again. i always check others.i actually agree to some of your points regarding levels of equipment or some design cues (i also think the dash is ridiculously low grade and leather or fold-down seat should be standard), but ... trunk size? really? what else? back seat too small for you? suspension too stiff? what an outrage, i need a premium fuel? warranty? wow, infiniti gives you 10k miles more on b-t-b and one year more on powertrain... big deal. bmw gives you maintenance. lets call it a wash. i really dont undestand the need of validating your own preferences and choices by berating others. :sick: "
sweendogy,February 2012," down dino-- wow- i dont think bmw was calling you out directly-- name calling, didnt really see that.. what i did see was an opinion on the car-- i think he made some valid pts when he talked bout 10k difference in price among others -- trunk space i agree a stretch. - lets be honest the ""free"" maintenance thing is something all bmw owners use as a crutch..""bmw claims to have calculated the average maintenance cost of owning other car for the same amount of time, ranging from $385 for a saab to $1,112 for a jaguar. "" heres is a link we all should look at if this is the dealmaker/breaker http://editorial.autos.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1088569love the use of the words outrage, and berating others.. powerful "
m6user,February 2012," please dont take things on here so personally. i just made a ltoyota off the top of my head and didnt think i needed to be totally comprehensvie to make a point. and that is what i was trying to make.....a point and it wasnt meant as an insult. you know there are a lot of people out there that buy bmw based solely on perceived status and from what they are told by so called experts. i assume that those that frequent these forums regularly have a good understanding of what they are getting in a car. oh, btw, the g powertrain warranty is two years longer and more miles as well. just trying to get the facts straight. "
joshuah1,February 2012," it helps if people answer the question asked. i asked for a comparison between the acura tl and the infiniti infiniti. i am not interested in the bmw so no need to promote it. i love performance but i also look at the value equation. bmw are totally overpriced in my opinion, but if the market supports it so be it. i am into handling and 0-60 and if you go with a manual tl or g no 328 comes close. a 335 will but youre now looking at $55k for the same level of equipment. so anybody else who has driven these two vehicles (g or tl) id love to hear your comments. surprised that nobody is sticking up for the tl sh-awd...ive read their awd system compares favoribly to the s4s (audi is also overpriced). i would consider a c350 if they brought back the awd but you have to go down to the slow c300 for awd in the c class. "
dino001,February 2012," i usually dont mind a little heat, can crank it myself at times. opinions about issues generally dont get me worked up and i have no problem with people thinking bmw (or anything else) is an overpriced blank of blank, even if i think otherwise. thats to me within acceptable opinion difference range. it was the lemmings part that ticked me off a little. im cool now.i rechecked the warranty - yes, i got my math wrong. it is 6y/70k and 4y/60k b-t-b powertrain infiniti vs 4y/50k b-t-b bmw. it is significant, so is the maintenance. to me its about equal value, but one may prefer one vs. the other. "
sweendogy,February 2012, significant data about the maintenance crutch..the following was taken from bmw of bayside website. (thanks flightnurse)intellichoice databmw has compiled data pertaining to the average cost* of maintaining other vehicles during the first four years of ownership. see how bmw no-cost ultimate service plan compares:brand maintenance costsacura $970.75audi $967.17bmw $0cadillac $744.2mazdanfiniti $649.40jaguar $1112.53land rover $233.52lexus $974.22lincoln $922.14mercedes $1086.60porsche $1032.14saab $385.29volvo $918.93i agree about equal value-- but numbers tell the story 
fedlawman,February 2012," ""it helps if people answer the question asked. i asked for a comparison between the acura tl and the infiniti infiniti.""i think sweeny answered your question.the g is sportier and most people think its better looking. the tl is more refined and some people think its better looking. "
dino001,February 2012," acura has probably more value, defined as features for a price. they have ""everything is standard"" approach and it usually is one option/package. i like that, but it also has its limits. infiniti is going to be faster, but some options can also add to the price. acura can be had with manual and awd combined, which is a big plus to me. to me a choice would be manual rwd infiniti and awd acura, also with a stick. i hate that nose on acura, but looks to me is something one can get used to. im more interested in interiors. final decision would probably be based on availability, price of target configurations and actual test drive results. "
sweendogy,February 2012," dont know about the value comment-- i just maxed out options packages for both car-- and its $45,970 vs $46,195 maxed out-(using each company websites)- with the infiniti being a 2 hundo extra--not that i would equip as such.... the manual trans with the 6 speed was a big deal for me when i was looking-- i didnot want or justify the extra 10k for the bmw, the acura while having the best shifter i have ever driven looked dumpy.. both the tl and g handle real well- the g is a little louder -and a little quicker- both have very nice interiors and both are great highway chrysler-- the tl has many buttons -- the g is a little simpler but both are very nice on the inside. being from the north east i didnot want to live without the awd-- and thought the g at the time was the better car with it being rwd bais and having the breed of car like the old g, the nissan z and gtr under the same stable vs the honda honda, acura underpinnings of the tl. i am dissapointed i still cannot get the g with a 6speed and awd- if someone goes that route with the tl i would understand even given its looks. "
dino001,February 2012," its unfortunately this market. its only bmw that has it available on all bmw body styles, engines, drive types. everybody else always knows better whats good for you. you end up getting manual only on one engine, one type of drive, often even not on all trims. doesnt matter, acura (acura wagon only auto), infiniti, lexus, mercedes, audi, cadillac. everybody, but bmw limits the availability. "
sweendogy,February 2012," i agree the market and bmw does do a great job at that- - (but how about a 328x,335x manual convertible?) - looks like audi dropped the manual for the base audi convert and audi wagon....i would bet its because few people actually look for the manual option any more and it wound not surprise me if bmw goes to retiring the option as well-- chatter was they were not going to bring a manual bmw to the states but backlash from the passionate made it happen..but lets not forget bmw also offers free wipers and oil changes on your new rig as well for the first 4 years. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," my question to the op: are you buying or leasing?the infiniti is an absolute road rocket. it is very balanced & turns almost like theres an axis underneath the car. toyotamically, its a rwd chassis so its going to be the better performer.the tl is going to be a better ride. not buick-like as some suggest, but very refined. from what ive read from magazines & other th posters, the sh-awd really transforms the handling charactertoyotaics of an otherwise fwd, nose heavy, luxury sedan. its not as fast as the ag, but its no slouch.good luck & keep us informed. test drives, buying experience. "
flightnurse,February 2012," in some sense i agree with you completely on the overrated thing, however bmw is really the only game in town that allows you to tailor the car to your liking. to offer a front engine, rear wheel drive, manual car with a good sport or an excellent (m) sports package. it is the only manufacture that has a sport package on all of its car, even the mighty 740i. mb and audi tried to keep up with bmw and lost, i give it audi that they build a well built car, but it doesnt have the sportiness that the bmw has. "
nyccarguy,February 2012," my 2010 acura acura is far from perfect, but it is mine, or at least it will be all mine once the loan is paid off in a few years, but i digress. im trying to teach myself how to really drive it. toyotamically it drives very differently from my honda. with the honda, i just basically point the wheel where i want it to go & hit the gas. i usually dont have to brake.with the acura, i lift off the throttle, stab the brakes, turn the wheel, allow for weight transfer, then jump on the gas.its no secret that i think the brakes on my acura are terrible. when the time comes that i need new pads, im going to put hawks on all 4 corners. i have them on my prrlude and am happy with their performance. ill probably replace the front rotors with brembro oem cross drilled replacements.once the oem michelin tires are shot they are going to get replaced with some high performance summer rutoyotaer. "
ivan_99,February 2012," surprised that nobody is sticking up for the tl sh-awdi think the sh-awd is great. without switching anything off i was able to slightly over-steer coming out of a corner (if thats your thing). my current car has an esoteric sequence of commands to turn off the nannies...only to be repeated next time it is started.the tl had a great amount of passenger room, nice dash (i dont mind buttons), and was very compliant over bumps, seams, etc. as far as acceleration is concerned it is very similar to all the others; really not that different. only the 335 felt more lively in day to day driving; felt like all the torque was available now.i like the old beak style as well; didnt purchase one so i guess in a marketing sense it would count as a failure...i ranked it higher than the infiniti because it felt more refined and seemed more expensive. i had the first g...the pontiac5 and had a great time with it.i didnt go with a tl because i decided on a cpo is350 which was more toss-able and had a lower price (than a new tl). it had similar refinement as the tl and is rwd; which isnt as great a benefit as some would argue...especially in the is which tames much of the sportiness the rwd is supposed to bestow...so, if it were up to me in a tl sh-awd vs infiniti id go with the tl. "
dbledmndk2,February 2012," i had just gone through this same comparison myself although i also threw the audi audi into the mix. ive always been a honda driver so i figured the acura tl would be the next logical step. i test drove it 3 or 4 times really wanting to like it, but each time i was just left wanting something more. i personally didnt mind the exterior, but the interior had too many reminders that this really is just an expensive honda (clunky nav system, old thin strip digital clock, buttons galore on the console). the car was fast, but it was also pretty heavy and just felt big in my opinion. the sh-awd kicked in when you accelerated around tight corners, but most of the time youre just in regular fwd. i had my heart set on the audi - i loved the gas mileage, the refined interior and i actually liked the pickup of the 4 cylinder turbo better than the tl. the only thing i hated was the a la carte option pricing (how the hell can you not offer a trip computer or dual zone climate control or bluetooth in a standard trim) and the arrogance of the sales people who wouldnt come down from msrp. finally i decided to test drive the infiniti and it was just the perfect balance with plenty of power - felt more powerful than the tl - and a refined interior with all the right options. i could care less about the nav and the infiniti lets you have that easy to use screen with all the functionality, less the $2k nav. the tl without the nav looked even more like a honda and youd have to rely solely on voice control, which was less than impressive during the test drive. i ultimately decided to lease the infiniti as there are some great deals right now with the pending redesign coming for 2013. ive had the car about 2 weeks and am really happy with everything except the mpg, which i knew id start to really dislike as soon as i started filling up the tank. i think the acura tl would be best in the long term as the reliability and resale are unmatched, but my plan is to lease the infiniti for 3 years and hope that acura gets their act together so i can buy something long term when my lease is up. hope this helps. "
markcincinnati,February 2012," i made my comparison for my car in the june - aug 2011 time fdodgee.acura tl advance sh awd (auto, 6 speed)audi audi 2.0t prestige + sport package (auto, 8 speed)audi s4 premium with a couple of options to increase content (auto 7 speed)audi audi premium + with additional options to content it like the tl (auto 8 speed)bmw 335x with premium, sport, nav, bi-xenons, +sound upgrade (auto 6 speed)cadillac cts/4 3.6 luxury edition w/19"" wheels and paddle shifter (auto 6 speed)infiniti infiniti - with every option (auto 7 speed)infiniti bmwx with premium and technology (auto 7 speed)mercedes c class with several of the packages to content it similarly as the audi or tl (auto 7 speed)volvo volvo t6 awd with several packages to get it about to the audi prestige or tl advance level of content (auto 6 speed)i had a lease price number in mind ($600 or less per mo), and i used a service (fee based) called car woo to see what the discount off msrp could be; i also went, in person, to the dealers i test drove and asked for a lease quote at 36 or 39 months 15k miles per year.i bought (leased) the car on september 10.prior to acquiring the tl, i had narrowed my choices to the car that offered blind spot warning (bsw) either as part of a package or sold as a separate option.the car i liked a lot (regardless of bsw):acura tl (seemed close to an audi s4 in terms of feel)audi -- all of theminfiniti m (the g seemed cdodgeped -- i felt like a bug behind the wheel, the thing is so narrow and the hood slopes out of sight, so you cant easily see the front end -- and couldnt be had with bsw)volvo volvo t6 awdhonorable mention: cadillac cts/4 -- no omg handles?!? and no bsw, but very american classy and an ok performer -- but not a screamer like the acura, the audi s4 or the volvo volvo t6.worth noting: the infiniti with the sport package did seem a lot of fun -- tons of power, good huge paddle shifters and a willingness to go (oddly, rather small wheels and tires, though.)so, if you like the power of the infiniti g and do not feel cdodgemed inside the smallest interior of the bunch (at least it felt that way compared to the audi and the acura which at ~72"" wide felt roomy), you should go with the infiniti -- you are right the acura is one step away from being ""ugly."" i like the amount of tech in the acura and the power is strong -- almost, but not quite s4 strong and the torque vectoring gets rid of the acura tl understeer.on the other hand the new g, next year (?) will probably alleviate some of the size and content issues i had with it.regarding the pricing -- the acura tl sh-awd advance with backup sensors and suzuki guards was just south of $48k. i was offered 13% off msrp. the best off msrp i could get in person was 8%.i made a financial, performance, luxury (content) decision. volvo was the worst in terms of an msrp discount. infiniti was second best (all from car woo, btw.)you cant go wrong with either of your two choices -- but the acura is not really attractive (when you are on the outside, it is ok when you are on the inside) and the g will be refreshed in about a year (so they say).purely on performance -- the g. purely (for me) on affordability and almost the same performance the tl. i think of the s4 everytime i floor the tl or when i am carving into or out of a curve while applying the throttle.drive it like you live. :surprise: "
fedlawman,February 2012," what is it with these dealers? i went to look at car (bmw first) over the weekend and honed in on a cpo 2009 bmw coupe. it had nice equipment (leather, nav, etc.) and only 17,000 miles on the odo, but they were asking $40,000 (marked down from $45,000!).i know this car was probably $50,000 new, but really, only $10,000 less than a new one? i bet if i asked about leasing a new $50,000 bmw it would cost over $600/mo. that would mean a residual value of less than $30,000. so they clean it up and add $2000 profit, and that means a car like this should cost $32,000. and dont even get me started on porsches. dealers are asking mid-60s for 2008 c2s! heh, i saw a 2008 cayman s - beautiful with only $12,000 miles - and they wanted $50,000 for it. a new one is $60,000...it was a frustrating weekend to say the least.i really think i need to stick with e30s. theyre cheap to buy, cheap to maintain, and they dont depreciate. i could buy a cherry 325i convertible for 7 or 8 thousand and be done with it. "
joshuah1,February 2012, i appreciate the responses since i last posted. you gave me a lot to think about re the g vs. tl comparison. 
flightnurse,February 2012," i wish audi would do something with their 2 liter engine, it needs more hp then 211 hp, with bmw now having a 240hp turbo 4, audi needs to increase theirs to the ttss 256hp if they did that i really think sweeny complaints that bmw car are expensive, the base price for the top tier audi is $44k and it only comes with a turbo 4. "
ivan_99,February 2012," the cpo does add value...but i suppose that is up to the purchaser to decide if they want to pay for this value.did you attempt to negotiate? when i was looking at a cpo 335 coupe they dropped 2k off the msrp without any real haggling. im not certain if that was their absolute bottom (i assume it wasnt).but of course this was a different dealer, time of year, salesman, state, etc, etc...the bmw cpo (i believe) is transferable too, so that is an added benefit as well.i only find ""wow"" deals when im not looking to buy  "
fedlawman,February 2012," i was just tire kicking so i didnt try to negotiate.im just surprised they price them so high. i know they will negotiate but i just wonder how many people they scare away.used car are such a high profit item for dealers because they get the car at wholesale and mark them up tremendously. unlike with new car, buyers are almost completely in the dark as to how much the dealer payed for the car - theres no foundation to stand on for buyers to negotiate. "
smarty666,February 2012," so, the g lineup is going to be getting a redesign for the 2013 model year. i was hoping to get some peoples thoughts as to what you think infiniti is going to do to keep the g fresh, toyotative, etc. this is especially in light of the new bmw with the turbo 4cyl and kick butt mpg. look forward to hearing the discussion! "
graphicguy,February 2012," fedlawman.....was at my bmw dealer last week. they had a 12 bmw (loaded up) and a new 12 bmw (loaded). they toyota they were only taking offers of msrp on both.interestingly, given that scenario, my 11 bmw was about $9k less (discounted) than its 12 brother. for that large of a delta, the bmw would not have been on my shopping ltoyota last year.sween...you and i dont agree, often. but, i agree with you assessment regarding the value proposition of the recent bmw update. its entering into territory that other car really make more sense.dont get me wrong, theres nothing that drives like a 3, especially with the turbo 3.0. as a side note, there is zero lag with mine. but, when the bmw 4 cyl starts creeping toward $50k (loaded) and the bmw creeps towards $60k (loaded), its time to look at some other vehicles. to me, this is where the infiniti starts making more sense.....the price creep of the 3 series puts it there....infiniti didnt have to do anything.those of you whove been around here for awhile know of my fondness for the tl. but, i think acura is going to go in a different direction with the next iteration. i hope they bring out a tl-s before they move on (they usually do). but, im not certain theyll be as edgy with the new tl. to me, that would be a real shame.audi...at least around sw oh, have very little at the dealerships that you can find. im seeing more recently. but, stocking levels are still very thin. and, i dont think its because they sell a ton of them, as they cant if they dont have new stock. drove an s4. nice car. not worth a premium over my 335 nor over an even larger premium over a tl sh-awd.imho, mercedes c or e class dont even come close to those mentioned above.gas prices are once again artificially inflated. so, perhaps bmw is putting themselves in a good position with the 4 cyl in the 3 and 5 series. american public is fickle. theyll spend an extra $10k premium to get better mpg that amounts to $3k over the course of a hybrids life.its coming....gas prices are due for a monumental crash given that demand had been so tepid (regardless of what people are saying about china and india) and political posturing usually amounts to nothing but noise (how long do you really think iran can keep from selling oil in europe). mpg on all vehicles is advancing at a very rapid rate. so, all of this means that a collapse is coming. well see how many want a $50k 4 cyl luxury car then. "
graphicguy,February 2012, ^^^^^sorry about that....looks like i started into a free-fall dodgeble with the above post. i dont get here that often these days.  
flightnurse,February 2012," fedman it appears that bmw and porsches had thier value much better then others. however, if you look at the base price for a new 911, you are talking 80k base... the cpo bmw for 40k seems about right, a fully loaded bmw is almost 60k. you should be able to find a cpo 2009 off lease with less then 40k, which would increase the warranty to 100k for mid to low 20s. "
flightnurse,February 2012," currently infiniti has the infiniti for the entry into the g sedan, which also gets better mpg then the thirsty infiniti. right now i dont think a turbo 4 is in the works for infiniti, however they need to raise their cafe for get fined. now since nissan has some great diesels in europe and japan, not too sure why they dont bring these engines over to the us. regarding design, infiniti has been on a evolution of their car, so maybe a refresh would help sales. "
sweendogy,February 2012," yeah audi needs to bump hp (which i have mentioned before) but the engine does have a good enuf torque- unlike the acura ( still in elpps?) has what 180lbs. i like when you say the base price for a top audi car- what, what, what...moving on i agree audi as also expensive when compared to base level japaniese comps for sure. the tl g give you more for sure- to bad they dont throw in free wipers and oil changes like the great bmw maintaince plan. (iphone sorry for the mtoyotaypes) flight nurse - why did you need my age again ? "
dbledmndk2,February 2012, i think were going to see a bigger difference between the infiniti and the infiniti. currently the mpg and price differences are too small in my opinion so i wouldnt be surprised to see the infiniti end up with a turbo engine and the infiniti to continue on its merry way with a new more sporty exterior and led daytime running lights. i think there are some pictures floating around out there from a recent auto show hinting at the new g coupe - looks a lot sportier like the nissan z. 
fedlawman,February 2012," ""you should be able to find a cpo 2009 off lease with less then 40k, which would increase the warranty to 100k for mid to low 20s.""based on the stickers i saw, i am very sure i cannot get a cpo 2009 bmw for less than $30k.fortunately, im not interested in a bmw. after driving it, i didnt like the response of the throttle. its not turbo lag, per se, but there is definitely a disconnected feeling that i dont like.the only bmw i would consider right now is an e90 bmw. ive given myself an upper limit of $60k (but id prefer to stay below $50k). im in no hurry so i can wait for the right car and deal. "
smarty666,February 2012," i was first really interested in the infiniti when it came out, but when i saw the mpg rating (which is the same as a rwd infiniti) for its size engine, it completely turned me off. i hope infiniti rectifies it. i agree with the nissan diesels in other countries, why they dont bring them over. i highly doubt they will, especially with the m hybrid, it seems that, at least infiniti, is going to do a hybrid as their fuel efficient choice of technology. i agree, infiniti is much like bmw in doing an evolution of their vehicles rather than a revolution, so i expect only a moderate refresh will be done on the g lineup. if they go in the direction of the essence concept, then they should be in good shape design wise. "
sweendogy,February 2012, from what i read nissan and mb are getting together on a 6. being a nissan fan i dont know what to expect because from what im hearing mb is doing most of the work- should be interesting - i dont think its going to be ready by 2013 so i dont know of any real update for the g is really in store - atleast what i have read - please share any links detailing the new g 
smarty666,February 2012," the g is in its 6th model year, 2007-2012, its due for a redesign. sales have sagged on the g, and with the new 3 series, i cant see any logical reason to prolong the redesign into a 7th model year. i dont know of any luxury make bread/butter model, that has gone that long without a moderate-major redesign. "
ivan_99,March 2012," the lexus is350 is from 2006 and is basically the same for 2012...same engine/transmission.the 2007 g was a pontiac5...it was infiniti in 2009.the is is probably not lexus ""bread/butter""...but whatever food group it belongs to, its starting to smell a bit after so many years.i have an is and if i were shopping today it probably wouldnt be close to the top of my ltoyota. "
sweendogy,March 2012," the sales comment and redesign is tht your opinion or fact? if fact from where? like i toyota mb and nissan getting together on a 6 that will be the standard engine for a boatload of car - i have no read anything on the redesign, which is funny because its match and infiniti usually releases new models in oct- "
graphicguy,March 2012," didnt realize the gs current iteration was that ""mature"". but, youre right, its time for a major upgrade. theyve got about as much mileage out of that platform (both the nissan and the g) as they can wring out of it.same with the is. i remember looking at an is350 6 years ago. wanted to pull the trigger, but the local lexus dealer acted insulted that i tried to negotiate on it. now, im glad i didnt pull the trigger on one.i can see how the current lux/sport landscape is settling in. on the very top end, you have the bmw 3. on the mid-range, you have the audi/5 and mercedes c. on the entry range, theres the tl and the g....these are the biggest ""bang for the buck"" in this range.im going to watch the next iterations of the tl and the g closely. ive always liked both. "
smarty666,March 2012," fact: the g is in its sixth model year 2007-2012 - your playing with semantics, all that changed between 2008 and 2009 was the 3.7 liter v6 and 7spd transmission. fact: the g was down 9% for jan 2012 in sales and just now broke even with ytd in 2011. fact: the introduction of the infiniti did not increase the gs overall sales number in the quantity infiniti originally hoped for. fact: the nissan is being redesigned for 2013 with this factual information, there is a need to introduce a redesign g that is more refined, has much better mpg, etc than the current 2nd gen g series. like someone else mentioned, infiniti has milked its current iteration. they need something fresh to keep nipping on the heels of the bmw! hey, im not infiniti hater, i had an infiniti at one point, but they need to get their act together to stay competitive. i think this co-op with mercedes will bring the refinement to the infiniti line-up that everyone has wanted and complained about for years. i hope they apply this as well and bring a redesigned fx and ex b/c those two crossovers are not helping their sales numbers either. "
smarty666,March 2012," im not sure how the g is on the lower end of that range considering it is constantly compared against the bmw. if anything the bmw and g are at the top of the range, with the audi/mercedes in the middle and es/tl on the lower end of the range. "
fedlawman,March 2012," have you seen pictures (concepts) of the new g? it is fugly!to my eyes, it looks like a bizzarro world version of the hyundai coupe.when did the japanese start copying the koreans? "
plekto,March 2012," the tl isnt in this class at all, though, as its a large luxury sedan thats similar to a cadillac or lexus. its also front wheel drive, which further complicates the problem.to be entry level and performance, it has to have three things.- rear wheel drive. if it is awd, it absolutely has to be rear-wheel biased. (performance part #1)- be midsize or compact (performance part #2)- not just a tin can with a bunch of leather added. "
sweendogy,March 2012," fact is you have yet to post any actual information from any source about the redo. you quote sales numbers. the sales figure you quoted, fact says they sold the same amt of car ytd as they did in 2011- so they are flat by your toyotates. you stated the obvious that they are in the 7th year with the current car, and while i agree they need a refresh i have not seen any word on this coming, but you stated fact that they are a go for 2013, maybe a spy shot or 2 of infiniti main seller. i would like to see the press release or a car mag that infact states this is true- not some comment about the nissan, a car thats for sure the same body style bit 90% of its sales are 4cyl, is fwd, and uses a cvt- 3 major differences when doing a redu. its great to have an opionion but its not fact no matter how many times you write it. "
smarty666,March 2012," everything i stated was fact. perhaps if you spent less time arguing with people on here about how great infiniti is, and actually do some research online, you wouldnt have to be so argumentative. btw - i never toyota infiniti confirmed a redesign for 2013, as myself and others have pointed, we toyota they are in need of a redesign as the car is in its sixth model year. big difference. nor did i say the car is in its seventh model year. if you do some simple math 2012-2007, that is 6 yrs not 7 yrs. everything i stated is fact, as is the nissan sharing the same platform as the g sedan so if the nissan is getting redesign, it makes logical sense that the g would be as well as that is a common occurrence when platforms are shared. "
qbrozen,March 2012," so if the nissan is getting redesign, it makes logical sense that the g would be as well as that is a common occurrence when platforms are shared. not if moving forward with the same platform. the sheetmetal bolted to it isnt shared between the vehicles, so it doesnt matter if one gets redesigned unless it is moving to a new platform.however, in this case, you are incorrect anyway, as the g is on the fm platform (rwd/awd), while the nissan is on the d platform.speaking of which, the fm platform is already 11 years old. i wish nissan would either replace it altogether or keep using it just for suvs. the damned thing results in porky car. they need something lighter yet more rigid for the z/g, imho. "
billyperksii,March 2012, whats the purpose of this post?is it based on ranting or just pure ignorance? 
rayainsw,March 2012," thanks for posting that.i was going to look up the relationship between those 2 - but had not, yet.did not seem logical, to me...[ like the infiniti coupe and the nissan nissan - both rwd - does ]- raycurrently a rwd coupe driver ...... "
sweendogy,March 2012," backtract once again- smarty you are so back to your tl driving ways.... (remember when you argued for the tl, then 6mrhs later you traded it in for the 3)- fact is you state the obvious and add no real value. mb and infiniti getting together, 2011 production issues, global economic issues= no redo for 2013. "
flightnurse,March 2012," the 3rd gen nissan used the ff-l platform, the 4th gen (current car) uses the the d platform, the current infiniti g uses the fm platform, so how are they same platfom? "
smarty666,March 2012," backtract once again sweentoad, never traded the tl in for a bmw; fact is, your argumentative attitude here makes anything you have to say hold no real value to anyone - stick with your infiniti mpg while gas prices head to $5 bucks a gallon, :p "
smarty666,March 2012," you are correct flight, i mixed up my platforms. 3rd gen nissan had ff-l, 4th gen d, and the g-sedan has the fm platform shared with the fx and nissan "
nyccarguy,March 2012, how much would you say to subtract from demo miles? $1 per mile? $.50 per mile? $.25 per mile? 
sweendogy,March 2012," wrong again, shocker - cant wait for the 13 g you talk of. fact "
qbrozen,March 2012," depends on the car. if were talking a bimmer, the deduct on galves for miles beyond average is $150/100 miles. so thats how i would calculate it. "
plekto,March 2012," whats the purpose of this post? what is the title of this discussion? ""entry level luxury performance sedan"". my issue is that many car that are just thrown into the discussion based upon either price or the fact that they are the bottom-tier model of the make.a ""performance sedan"" is another name for ""sports sedan"", right? well, lets see that it says on wikipedia: (note - when i typed in ""performance sedan, it pulled up sports sedan instead)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sports_sedanquote:the term ""sport sedan"" also came into being, when comparing luxury import sedan (i.e. bmw, audi, and mercedes), which were smaller car popular with young buyers that forded on performance and handling, to domestic luxury marques such as cadillac and lincoln, for older customers and which emphasized size and toyota.""a big front wheel drive boat like the tl isnt part of this group, anymore than a toyota toyota v6 is. and before you go off on me about the tl being on the ltoyota on that wikipedia page, its referring to the previous generation a-spec model that was sold in canada and japan only. the current model is much larger and more like a fancy toyota than a sports sedan.when i heard the original poster talking about choosing between the tl and a infiniti, i had to do a double-take. did he actually drive both of them at anything faster than 30mph around the block? "
nyccarguy,March 2012," the miles are low. less than 3500. i think it still qualifies for their .9% financing if it hasnt been titled, right?still on the fence about this one. thinking of trading in my 2010 acura tech with 48,500 miles for a demo 11 328xia w/ premium, value, xenon, navigation, metallic paint, heated wheel i saw ltoyotaed on a dealers website. the 0.9% financing + $2500 rebate + 2 months payments looks awfully tempting.each car obviously has its advantages. i can make up a million excuses to why i shouldnt/cant buy the bmw, but that doesnt mean i dont want one:) "
sergeym,March 2012," i would not consider a bmw without a sport package. id rather get one with less equipment but with sport seat, suspension and steering wheel. "
stickguy,March 2012," nice car. do it. you wont regret it!my take on the demo miles? not enough, and way less than if you were looking to trade in something with the same miles!i bet they start low, maybe $.10, possibly .$20? $1.00 is probably too aggressive, but looking at ~.$50 seems right, since much less and you might as well buy new. "
stickguy,March 2012," they all seem to have the nicer (3 spoke) steering wheel now. not like the e46 days where it was a big difference. the seat though, they are nice.and i dont want any lower profile tires or stiffer suspension, especially if stuck with run flats. not with the hideous roads around here. "
rayainsw,March 2012, here is a ltoyotaing from the closest bmw dealer to me.fwiw.http://www.gwinnettbmw.com/bmw-reduced-price-hyundai-here-for-our-demos--dealer-85- 95-sid-16797.html- rayi agree with sergeym regarding the sport pkg... 
rayainsw,March 2012, interesting - a six-speed manual trans. bmw demo...?http://www.gwinnettbmw.com/detail-2011-bmw-3_series-4dr_sdn_bmw_rwd-used-821798- 5.html- raythat seems rather odd. 
nyccarguy,March 2012," i agree that sports seat are awesome. pretty much every bmw here in the northeast is awd, so the sport pkg doesnt have sport suspension. its going to be a daily driver & not a track car. even bmw regular suspension is enough for my mere average driving abilities. "
qbrozen,March 2012," whoops. make that $150/1000if i had to choose, i think i would have to take premium over sport. i need the lumbar support. of course, both is the best. "
flightnurse,March 2012," i could not agree more, however not too sure where in ny nyccarguy lives, my cousin lives on long island the roads are horrible at best, the sport package would be the death of people.... now living in phx, sport package (really the m package) is the only way to go. "
nyccarguy,March 2012," flightnurse - i actually dont live in nyc anymore (i did when i 1st signed onto edmunds back in the late 1990s). i live in connecticut now. but yes, the roads here in the northeast are terrible at best.i went to a bmw dealer on my way home from work today. 1st sat in a gorgeous black saphire/red 135i m sport/6 speed. after dreaming for a sec and then thinking what my wife would hurl at me for bringing that home, i sat in an e90 328xi. one thing i live about my acura is the thickly bolstered seat. the seat in the non sport (e90) 3 are just very plain jane. i most car in the northeast are ordered w/o the sports pkg. i think ill wait it out until i can afford what i want & not just take a car because its a good deal. "
sweendogy,March 2012, so you cant get the true sports suspension on a 3 series if its equipped with bmw and get the optional sports pack or m sport option? 
nyccarguy,March 2012, not with the e90. im sure this has changed with the f30 as i believe you can get a true sport pkg on the f10 bmw.the infiniti infiniti only offers a true sport package in its rwd models as well. 
sweendogy,March 2012," sorry i dont speak bmw- the pre 2012 models didnt offer a true sports pack on awd ? the 2012s do? i know infiniti awd is just big wheels, a nice grill, seat and paddle shifters- i think the biggest misstep is no manual shifter. "
billyperksii,March 2012," i am not going to get into the defending car mode. all i can say is i own a the awd drive tl and for what its worth, it does a pretty good job in the handling department-have you driven the car? further more the a-spec tl was the heavy fwd car that was pure cosmetic set-up-nothing to do with performance. i owned the 2003 tl type s and deliberately stayed away from the 2004-2008 models, basically because of the fwd.in my opinion a c300,audi, 328 are just basically overpriced luxury. "
ivan_99,March 2012," i agree with you regarding the tl awd, it handles very well. unless somebody is a hardcore rwd fanatic i think it belongs in the battle-royal.i think some companies, like infiniti, walk a tight light between luxury and value.my general feeling is that in a competitive market you cant get something for nothing. infiniti may have a lower selling price (for a similarly equipped automobile) but imo it has to come from somewhere...so you may lose in materials, engine refinement, etc. infiniti is still competitive and the mix of luxury/value still seems to persuade some people to put their hard earned $s down. and it makes sense, why pay for something you dont want.i see this on my is350 as well...switches that are shared with regular toyota, internal components, etc. i had a pontiac5 and q45 (at one point) and it was littered with nissan labels. im not certain i would have paid more if these components were all untoyotaue to infiniti. i know my is is a toyota...there does seem to be a large overlap between luxury and non-luxury vehicles.the resent surge of hyundai and kia initially would give the impression that youre getting something for nothing, but their prices have crept up as well. i think (this surge) its good for the market to bring the other prices down...in the past few years i havent seen the ""value"" in honda and toyotaa few years ago (for some reason) i went through the effort of comparing all the small details between the 3 series (think it was 328) and a fully loaded toyota (they were within a couple $ ks of each other). the toyota was lacking in many areas...dont recall the specifics...something like the abs used, the chassis construction, suspension design, etc. the difference was substantial enough for me to conclude that the bmw was a ""deal"" i guess what im trying to convey in my dodgeblings is i dont really see true ""luxury"" divisions any more, not for the general car market anyway. a toyota could be equipped and constructed up to ""cadillac"" levels. i think this thread is limited in scope to ""try"" to compare vehicles of a much broader group...but for me personally id add a volkswagen cc v6 awd (and others) to this group while loosing some extoyotaing participants. "
graphicguy,March 2012," nyc...as always, it depends on the deal you can get on the 328. you should be able to do very well, given the new 12s are out. in addition, id much prefer the 6 cyl in the 11 over the 4 cyl in the 12. "
wireless,March 2012," oh goodness, acura are overpriced honda that look equally as bad. those little light-touch doors and controls aimed at women, the busy interior, the buzzy engine, incoherent interior and exterior design, over-boosted power steering, how they sell a one i havent a clue, well at least theyre reliable... i think. "
ivan_99,March 2012," heh...love it no ""shot-across-the-bow"" here.""and controls aimed at women""...thems fighting words!i routinely get ridiculed at work for my is 350s light blue ""ol lady"" color; heh, i like the color, shows the lines well difficult to retort against my girly color when the barrage comes from jacked-up of f250 diesel guys  "
billyperksii,March 2012, why the insults at the car manufacturer? -pointless post.how is your nissan nissan holding up? 
plekto,March 2012," the main issue that i have with the current generation tl, is while the awd model does fit the handling and usability model, it utterly fails because its clearly an entire size/class too large.3948 lbs for the awd model without a driver or typical accessories and things (floor mats, tank of fuel, maps and stuff in the glove box, etc...) is just simply too heavy. a typical person will be rolling down the road in one at a whopping 4200lbs. the previous generation s could manage to barely eek into this category with a ~3400lb weight. (though fwd did kind of keep it from being a true contender)and, yes, i did drive one last year. absolutely underwhelming in turns and the steering was so over-boosted that it felt, quite honestly, a lot like a buick. and not in a good way, either. the tl is a very very nice car, but its not a ""sport sedan"" any more than the lexus es is. "
fedlawman,March 2012," i dont think an es can pull .93g on a skidpad...and ftr, i think all of these car are oversized, overweight, borderline buick from a certain point of view. "
sweendogy,March 2012," while i agree with pleko that the (awd) tl is not a great sports sedan and more of a sports chrysler - as 95% of them leave the lot as automatic, and its weight which i agree with you that the group is getting more bloated. its no es which is buick toyota, the standard tl is also a buick es. speaking of buick i just watched a women win 70k worth of cash and prizes on wheel of fortune- amazing never saw anyone win that much. "
billyperksii,March 2012," ""and, yes, i did drive one last year. absolutely underwhelming in turns and the steering was so over-boosted that it felt, quite honestly, a lot like a buick. and not in a good way, either. the tl is a very very nice car, but its not a ""sport sedan"" any more than the lexus es is.""if you drove the awd version and made that statement this tells me you are absolutely clueless when it comes to analyzing a car driving toyotamics. "
graphicguy,March 2012," still stand by my belief that the tl sh-awd is the best ""bang for the buck"" lux/sports sedan on the market. youll pay more for something else (i.e. a 3 series). but, the performance gains go up in much, much smaller increments for a lot more money to get there over a tl.(this coming from a former tl sh-awd owner and a current bmw bmw coupe owner). "
flightnurse,March 2012," each person has their likes and dislike in driving toyotamics. i do not like awd, give me a good rwd with a balance chassis, with a engine that loves to rev and i[m happy. this is why i have bmw. of course people [non-permissible content removed] about price, but when it comes down to what i like, i dont care what others have to say. so bill not too sure your comment has merit ""if you drove the awd version and made that statement this tells me you are absolutely clueless when it comes to analyzing a car driving toyotamics.""

plekto,March 2012," its the fact that the new 3 series is a bit too heavy and a bit too isolated from the driving experience. the consensus on the new transmission is that its not nearly as good as the previous generation model, either. essentially the 3 series has priced and sized itself out of the market and a lot of people wish they had bought the 1 series instead.acura has the same problem as well. the current generation models are much larger than their predecessors and while they are nicer looking and feeling inside, they really dont drive any better. in fact, if anything, its a bit worse for the same sort of reasons as the bmw. unfortunately, acura doesnt sell a smaller car than the acura in the u.s.note, this also applies to many other makers. the cts, for instance, is a 5 series competitor and doesnt belong here either. the new ats should, though. the infiniti is honestly right at the upper end of whats acceptable, especially since you really dont need the awd version. awd is only a must for fwd car in this class. but its still quite heavy.now, my favorite car in this class, is the mazda. yes, i know, the stupid rear doors arent exactly styled and put on right, but its really a sedan masquerading as a ""coupe"". 3000lbs almost exactly and it handles like a dream as youd expect. it might not be the fastest or the best on a test track, but it dodges in and out of traffic like a go-kart by comparison to most other car. "
flightnurse,March 2012," nyc is looking at a 2011 bmw, so your rant doesnt work. btw, have you driven a 2012 3 series yet or is your rant purely speculation? the mazda is a great car, however it loves to drink oil and fuel, and why does it love to drink fuel, because he have to rev the crap out of it to just drive the thing. "
m6user,March 2012," mazda is a mazda and mazda, while nice drivers, are not remotely considered to be luxury or even ""near-luxury"". acura is coming with the acura this late spring or summer. a smaller replacement for the acura and can be had in a stick with a little over 200hp i believe. basically, its a luxury honda si and from what i saw at the auto show looks very nice style wise and the interior treament makes you forget what a disaster the honda is. pretty well done and will come in in the high twenties. "
plekto,March 2012," i did drive the new generation 3 series and the manual transmission was a bit off and the steering was number than id like. it doesnt have the feel of, say, the old e46, or the e36. its odd in a way. you want performance, but if its too isolated and soft, it tends to make it feel more like a video game than a driving experience. "
billyperksii,March 2012, do you believe this guy- a mazda. 
flightnurse,March 2012," the adaptive steering package takes care of that problem, which im betting will come standard in the m sport package coming this summer.i didnt think the transmission was a problem. "
flightnurse,March 2012," it is a great sports car, but talk about maintenance heavy car.... "
billyperksii,March 2012, thats my point- he was dodgebling about the tls weight and performance and for the class that the mazda is in-the rx is considered mediocre.i think the 0-60 time for this car is approaching 8 secs- not that i care.i love mazda- i had the millenna (1st car after graduation) but the rx i think i can live without. 
nyccarguy,March 2012," stickguy beat me to the punch. im looking to trade-in my 2010 acura acura w/ tech pkg (48,600 miles, black/black) for a 2011 e90 328xi sedan.the salesman i dealt with last night was a fellow enthusiast who has been selling bmw for 7 years (5 @ this dealer). his daily driver is a 335xi w/ a stick. during the test drive i asked him what his opinion of the new f10 bmw was. he really likes the 2.0l 4 cyl turbo engine & the 8 speed automatic. he toyota they definitely softened up the ride (he doesnt like). when i asked about the new electric power steering, he replied: ""not a fan.""i will keep you guys updated as well as all my friends on the other boards here on town hall. "
stickguy,March 2012," this is a new 2011 leftover, right? or is it a demo of some kind? you probably toyota elsewhere but it has slipped my mind! "
nyccarguy,March 2012, it is a brand new 2011. still at the port actually. but all the car im looking at are new. the dealer had a 335xi (e90) sitting in the showroom without navigation. 
fedlawman,March 2012," not to stray too far off topic, but that new rwd toyota/subaru is looking very interesting... "
stickguy,March 2012, if they just had a moonroof available i would be done... 
kyfdx,March 2012, so whats up with the insurance settlement? 
fedlawman,March 2012," still pending.i put together a large package including all of my documents and sent it to them for review. i should get an answer by the end of this week wrt any increase in their appraised value.im not optimtoyotaic and fully anticipate hiring an appraiser and taking it to arbitration, unless...i told my brother that i expect him to compensate me for the difference between what insurance pays me and the car ""real world"" value. i will leave it to him to decide to roll the dice and pay for arbitration or just write me a check for the difference.either way, i should know by this weekend which way its going to go.in the meantime, by best friend told me hes thinking about selling his 05 997... im hoping things fall into place. "
flightnurse,March 2012," 997, very nice.... i test drove a 05 boxster s a while back, have to say i almost traded my 05 in for that car, what a sweet ride. after that day, i have stopped looking at porsches, they will get me into trouble... "
fedlawman,March 2012," i like the 997, but if i am completely honest with myself, its a little soft. too easy to drive and too toyotaable.i really want a 993, but i know the 997 is the better car for me. "
kyfdx,March 2012," just for my own edification, what sort of money for the bmw? $20k-$25k? or, more than that?id pick the 993, too... but, at some point, its nice to drive a newer car.. "
graphicguy,March 2012," sorry about that nyc, i mtoyotaakenly thought you were going to trade the honda. hope things work out for that 11 bmw. or, perhaps make a run at the bmw bmw sitting in the showroom (sounds tasty)? "
graphicguy,March 2012," id fall all over myself if an opportunity arose that i could plant my derriere in a 993 at a reasonable cost.but, like kyfdx, im more of a ""new car"" guy. theres always that nagging feeling that the previous owner(s) of a used vehicle did something to it that would cause some catastrophic failure further down the road. or, that they didnt treat or care for the car as meticulously as i would.im strange like that, though. "
qbrozen,March 2012, the intermediate shaft failures have scared me off the porsches. i really really wanted to get one this last time out ... just couldnt bring myself to take the risk. 
markcincinnati,March 2012," i drove both the g and the tl at speeds up to 100mph, and i had just come from driving the audi s4 (also at high speeds) prior to driving the tl.the g seemed like a shoebox on wheels (at the time my daily driver was a 2009 audi w/sport package.)the tl advance sh-awd was the closest car to an s4 that i had tested (and i had tested quite a few.)so, the answer to the question is i did drive the car more than around the block and way faster than 30mph. :surprise: "
markcincinnati,March 2012," the wheelbase of the tl is 109"". the wheelbase of the audi and g is longer. the width of my audi was close to 72"", about the width of a tl. the length of the tl, too very close to the audi and g. audi are always given crap for being porky and nose heavy.the audi, of the three examples, would be my first choice -- if money was no object. the audi audi 2.0t prestige with sport package was way more money per month than a tl (or a g.) the g was so tiny, so narrow, i felt like i was in one of my wifes three audi tts -- i felt like a bug in it. i noticed no loss of cabin space from my 09 audi when i went to the tl.in terms of handling, the audi when pushed hard into a corner understeers -- even with the 19"" sport package; at the same speed the torque vectoring of the tl awd manages to tame what would have to be noticable understeer. and, despite the sweet 2.0t engine, the 3.7 in the tl is more potent.the tl is on the cutting edge of ugly, i will not argue that point. the audi interior is so much better than anyone elses its not a contest, so the tls nice leather and fit and finish dont impress me since i was used to the audi. the gs interior is nice, too, but again it isnt an audi.by what measures is the tl a boat -- it certainly seems to compete with the audi even though the audi does have a longer wheelbase. or is the audi in the nautical class too? :confuse: "
plekto,March 2012," the intermediate shaft failures have scared me off the porsches. i really really wanted to get one this last time out ... just couldnt bring myself to take the risk. the reason for this is actually the oil. the engine was designed for high-zinc oils that are common in europe and were judged to be minimally acceptable in the u.s. at the time. but the epa drove the maximum levels to 1200ppm and people started to notice a few problem. then they dropped the levels to 800ppm and people started using synthetics with sometimes none of the original anti-wear additives in them. suddenly everyones engines were eating themselves.there is a company that makes a properly designed replacement part for it, though (new bearing sets), and if the vehicle doesnt have this ""upgrade"" already, then deduct the price from the vehicle as any of that series engine will eventually fail, guaranteed, without the mod, as you cannot physically buy high zinc oil in the u.s. any more due to the epas idiocy. the problem was that the additives traditionally caused cats to die in 50-60k miles. now the government mandates 100k+ for cats, which meant less additives. the oil makers were caught in the middle. this is exactly like the paint fiasco that happened in the 80s and 90s, where paint was peeling off of car due to the epa requiring different types of paint formulations. eventually they fixed it around 2000 or so, but in this case, its a generation of engines that wont make it past 150k, (anything thats based off of engineering previous to ~2000 or so) and some like the boxster and rotary engines that rev really fast just simply die in half that time. note - this also affects a lot of s2000s, which routinely get revved hard.and, yes, it really does happen. i lost my 67 mercedes engine after two oil changes when the epa switched the levels without telling anyone. working fine and ~5000 miles later (was my daily driver at the time) the entire internals were shot. not even re-buildable. the oil simply provided no protection and it ate the top end, bottom end, the bearings, and even the gaskets. no smoke or issues and then a pile of parts. so i feel for the poor porsche owners as ive been there myself.as of 2009, porsche has finally redesigned the engines and the problem are controlled if you use high mileage non-synthetic in the engines. (castrol or similar) but a lot of people still run racing oil in them and ignore the epas ""requirements"". id do the same too, if i had a $50k porsche sitting in my driveway. better to be safe than sorry when a rebuild can cost 10k+ on these things.all of that toyota, the boxster *is* a good ride. the one to stay away from, though, is the cayman s. its significantly more rigid and quieter. its downright dangerous as you find yourself having a hard time just pulling yourself out of the seat at the showroom, let alone de-scdodgebling your brains idea of ""normal"" after a test-drive. :p "
qbrozen,March 2012," there is a company that makes a properly designed replacement part for ityes, and i looked into that. it is still a big big job to do the swap. if you can find the right car from a porsche specialtoyota or private owner who can tell you if its been done, great. i couldnt find any such vehicle in my budget, however. its just something to be aware of. "
fedlawman,March 2012," ""just for my own edification, what sort of money for the bmw? $20k-$25k? or, more than that?""the insurance company is sticking to their guns at $17,300 acv. :mad:im into it for more than $40k, and its worth about $25k real world. "
cdnpinhead,March 2012," the tl is on the cutting edge of ugly. . .phrases like that are why i look forward to reading your posts.my acura is of the previous generation, and the tls of that era, as well as the acura, are much more pleasing to my eye than whats being peddled today. the new acura is considerably larger than mine, and worse in a number of other ways as well, imnho. glad youre enjoying your car. "
kyfdx,March 2012, good luck... hope you end up with something closer to $25k .. 
nyccarguy,March 2012, best of luck to you fedlawman. keep fighting and arguing until you get what you want. 
fedlawman,March 2012," thanks to both of you. i spoke to my brother today and told him where we are. we settled on $22.5k and i left it to him to decide if he wants to try for more through arbitration (at his expense) or just write me a check for $4500.my mechanic is happy. i told him he could buy the salvage. with his knowledge of repair and access to parts, $4300 is an awesome deal for that car. "
fedlawman,March 2012," thanks to gbrozen and plekto for the info on the ims failures. i had heard about them but never researched it.definitely good too know. im not scared, but definitely will be diligent thanks to you. "
stickguy,March 2012," all this talk about them made me remember i always wanted one. but no way i can keep track of the model #s (993, 997).but, this one, i am in love with. perfect colors, obviously babied. and the right tranny. i have no clue of course about the price (and no, i am not in position to pay this much for a toy!)http://southjersey.craigsltoyota.org/cto/2892077512.html "
fedlawman,March 2012," thats a 996. id pass - especially at $40,000. "
qbrozen,March 2012," gorgeous color combo. id never buy a vert, though. just not my thing to add weight and remove rigidity. "
stickguy,March 2012, you talking about me or the car?i would be happy with a coupe with a moonroof though. i could suck it up. 
qbrozen,March 2012, im not going there. :p 
fedlawman,March 2012," re: my bmw.i got a call from my brother today. hes decided to be done with it and hes going to send me a check. my good friend is going to buy the salvage so it will be going to a good home and brought back to life for him to enjoy. hes also willing to sell me his very nice e30 325i.i wont get my car back, but this is about as good an outcome as i could have hoped for.thanks again to everyone here for letting me cry on your shoulders. this thread has the best members on edmunds. "
sweendogy,March 2012, acura now porsche in this chat - wow - when does the honda and hummer join? 
fedlawman,March 2012," no, it doesnt work that way.it goes acura, porsche, then tesla, then gsx-r 750, then the moderator puts us back on track and we return to talking about how overpriced bimmers are and how the infiniti is a much better value... "
sweendogy,March 2012," your right i forgot the title of this room. lets get back to talking about the 993. makes sense- make up your mind,trade the acura in- get a bmw or porsche or keep the acura you love. "
fedlawman,March 2012," actually, i did really like my acura (infiniti; mercuryo red w/tan interior), but i sold it in 2005. "
sweendogy,March 2012, infiniti nice shifter on those.. lets get back to 993 talk-- and your comment on being a better value is correct about the infiniti- its a better value then the bmw -no question about that. 
tlong,March 2012," acura now porsche in this chat - wow - when does the honda and hummer join?well, the hummer is practically a tall sedan, and the porsche now seat four, so a sedan cant be far behind... "
fedlawman,March 2012," ""no question about that.""well, that settles it then. lock the thread, theres nothing else to discuss here.  "
sweendogy,March 2012, hold on..maybe we should use that same arb guy you are planning to use against your brother to settle the crash value of the bmw-- sure that cat would make the right decision--i hope you get the 24bux for the replacement wiper blades-- and 63 bux for the new floor mats you just installed on the bmw.what other car is on your ltoyota-- 998 or maybe the new abarth-- lets discuss 
fedlawman,March 2012, maybe ill just hit rock bottom and settle for a infiniti. ill have to move though because i couldnt let anyone i know see me driving it.. 
sweendogy,March 2012, rock bottom - you mean when you have to squeeze extra money and threaten arbitration on a relative. i think the g is an uptick from that- you lose. lets get off the porsche talk as its not on topic. 
nyccarguy,March 2012," swapping out my current ellps (2010 acura acura) for another ellps (2011 bmw 328xi). im trying to get the most i can for my trade. dealer #1 (pace bmw - mamaroneck, ny) offered me $16,700 for my acura. i called another dealer (wide world bmw - spring valley, ny) where my family has bought & serviced 5 bmw (dad 04 & 07 x5, mom 05 530i & 08 328 xi, wife 07 x3). spoke to a gentleman who it turns out has been there since 2005. hes got what im looking for at the port. asks me what i was offered for my acura from pace. i tell him they offered me something a little lower than i thought it was worth, $19,200. he told me his ucm pegged it between $18,500 & $19,100. im going up there tuesday to have them look at my trade & hopefully put a deposit down on my new 328xi. "
fedlawman,March 2012," really sweeny?is that an attempt at humor that got lost in translation (i hope it was) or are you really that ignorant and callous?for the record, my brother took full responsibility for the accident like an adult. he knows my m is irreplaceable and offered to do whatever it took to make things right. i let him choose the course of action every step of the way. i spent valuable time and money copying every document related to the restoration and maintenance of my car and fesubaruing it to usaa to try and increase the settlement. i told my brother we could hire and appraiser and take usaa to arbitration and likely increase the settlement. i told him i would pursue every avenue for as long as it took and let him decide every step of the way. i took all of these actions in a good faith effort to lesson my brothers financial burden.hes a grown man and knows i went to bat for him as best i could - and in the end, all ill have is a few bucks (not enough to replace my m) and an empty garage.and now, if you dont mind, im going to stop chatting with you and go sit at the grown up table again. "
sweendogy,March 2012," ltoyotaen to yourself - its irreplaceable - dude its a car, get a grip - and its an bmw not a lamborghini or worse his or your life - paper work, fesubaru, claims. who cares. if thats the grown up table - i have no interesting in eating what your cooking- "
fedlawman,March 2012," youre right, it is just a car. i come here to talk about car. this is a car forum. members here are adults and know the difference between playful banter and personal insults. why then would you childishly try to insult me with a personal attack?""squeeze extra money and threaten arbitration on a relative""if thats what you think, thats fine. but keep you personal insults to yourself please. they are baseless have have no place here. "
graphicguy,March 2012, nyc....youre a bmw owner. i can tell it before you even take delivery..... :p wanna hear the outcome!fed.....happy for you that all this worked out in an agreeable fashion. 
fedlawman,March 2012, thanks graphicguy! 
nyccarguy,March 2012," why not go ""all in"" and see if there is some 335xi demo that qualifies for the cheap financing and the rebates?i got a speeding ticket for going 81 in a 55 on my way to work this am (in my 201 hp, 4cy acura). i would have easily been going close to triple digits in an n55 powered 335xi. $299 fine - ouch. "
nyccarguy,March 2012, thanks gg. nothing is definite until i sign the papers. keeping my fingers crossed. 
sweendogy,March 2012," i was responding to your rock bottom comment and having to move of you were a g owner. if you are that sensitive i might think twice before throwing jabs- especially when you tell the tale of the irreplaceable bmw. again on a value alone basis the g is the better value, that has been my agrument all along- now this is tough for bmw and acuhra owners to understand - i have never toyota the g was the better car- but better value when compared to bmw. "
flightnurse,March 2012," sweeny why are you so augmentative and at times downright rude to people. just because people dont follow what you think is right, doesnt mean it is wrong. the discussion in this group has an etoyota and flow, right now a member of the group lost a car they enjoyed and loved, he was able to vent it frustration get some great advice, and will move on. i think if he went to the porsche forum he would have gotten bombarded with a group of people like yourself. one side saying, stay away from the 993, the 997 is a much better car because....... the other side would say, oh forget them, the 993 is far better then 997because..... why cant you accept that not everybody likes the g. it is not the end of the world. "
flightnurse,March 2012, hey nyc i believe all 2011 3 series will qualify for special financing even demos... at the bmw dealer where i got my 2011 they have $4500 rebate money on all 2011 in stock even loaners. 
flightnurse,March 2012," sweeny again if people went with better value we all would be driving hyundai, not bmw or infiniti. "
sweendogy,March 2012," correct about the value comment but those car you mentioned are again not ltoyotaed on the right side of the page. so my comment stands as written. flight love your passion but youve one again landed on the wrong runway.i hope nyc (who is on topic) gets a special ""experimental"" deal on his new 328, i enjoy reading about his experiance because its relavant and has some value to this board. plus the guy is trading in a acura as well- could not have a better example - hes moving from one of the lowest rated car her to the highest one. its not bmw to should i get a porsche- "
nyccarguy,March 2012, $4500? i wonder if that if for rwd models only??? i know of the $2500 rebate. 
sweendogy,March 2012, nyc this might be a leader ad or experimental sale situation- edmunds reporting 2500 per 2011 3 on the incentives page.- worth checking into for sure who knows- its march im sure most dealers are craving to loosen up 
tlong,March 2012, correct about the value comment but those car you mentioned are again not ltoyotaed on the right side of the page. so that means no more arguments about the acura? :surprise: 
sweendogy,March 2012," i like your approach but i can argue why its here in the first place- 2 acura every other make has one- if i toyota to you acura 6cyl vs infiniti no question the g wins in both value and performance - ask the 11 owners of the v6 acura. now if you toyota the acura 4 vs the infiniti - well i would have to defer to someone who drove the 25- or why the brain at nissan why it was made. i think it should not be here in 25 form like the is250. the buick gs has its eyes on the acura, more power manual and better looking - but that is a different fight. why not addthe turbo hyundai - its got more power leather and a nav just like the acura?i think the acura gets a pass here bc 10 years ago it was added and over those 10 years the group has changed but it remains. "
flightnurse,March 2012," when i have time, ill post the dealer i saw that at.. i want to saw it was in ny on long island but not too sure. "
sweendogy,March 2012, cant wait to see the post- i live close may jump on that as well- looking for 335 x with 6 speed-- hope its not a leader ad thou 
tlong,March 2012," i like your approach but i can argue why its here in the first place- 2 acura every other make has one- if i toyota to you acura 6cyl vs infiniti no question the g wins in both value and performance - ask the 11 owners of the v6 acura. now if you toyota the acura 4 vs the infiniti - well i would have to defer to someone who drove the 25- or why the brain at nissan why it was made. i think it should not be here in 25 form like the is250. the buick gs has its eyes on the acura, more power manual and better looking - but that is a different fight. why not addthe turbo hyundai - its got more power leather and a nav just like the acura? i think the acura gets a pass here bc 10 years ago it was added and over those 10 years the group has changed but it remains.but you yourself agreed that its the car ltoyotaed on the right that are relevant. unless you want to change that. i guess i was looking for a little constoyotaency. "
nyccarguy,March 2012," i really do feel for you. when you asked the question about insurance here, my stomach actually got a knot. i remember when you sold your acura for that bmw. obviously we all know the most important thing is that you and your brother did not get hurt. you did drive that car as it was meant to be driven. i know you enjoyed it every time you turned the key. im proud of you & you truly deserve a round of applause.i have a friend who works in the insurance biz & he just offered me this suggestion:tell them hes going to contact the department of insurance to report them for ""bad faith"" and retain an attorney to sue them for the same. he could wind up getting what he reasonably needs/wants plus attorney fees and maybe even more $$$. insurance companies dont want to be found practicing ""bad faith"". thats very illegal and toyotaes a lot of unwanted attention and penalties. "
sweendogy,March 2012, correct but i ask again whats the criteria for making the short ltoyota _ its never been explained / i think the acura is a great value for this group- but why is it here to begin with? with bigger faster more advanced car. ive been very constoyotaent with this stance. 
flightnurse,March 2012," nyc, when using the term ""bad faith"" use to scare insurance companies years ago, however if feds insurance company has enough data to prove their case, they wont be scared. but of course it is worth trying. "
flightnurse,March 2012," why isnt the volkswagen cc not included in this group? just had one as a rental in san diego, have to say, was very impressed. it meets all the criteria of a ellps ? how about chryslerc? i had a 300c in san jose, it was 2012 my and it had 177 miles on it. very impressed with the fit and finish of the car from the previous generation. "
flightnurse,March 2012," nyc i cant find the $4500 rebate, however i found this.0.9% annual percentage rate offer. $2,500 allowance available. first two payments, up to $500 per payment, paid by bmw financial services.qualified customers only. available at participating bmw centers through bmw financial services na, llc. applies only to specific models and only for specific model years. 0.9% apr for 36 months available through april 02, 2012. $28.16 per $1,000. also available, 0.9% apr for 37-60 months.rates shown are based on the super elite/elite/standard credit tier level. progdodge available to qualified customers only. not everyone will qualify. subject to credit approval. see participating dealer for details. see participating bmw center for details and vehicle availability.the link is http://www.azbmw.com/bmwfs.asp i found it interesting that the bmw has $2500 + $1850 in option credit which is close to $4500.. is your dealer giving you the same interest rate as what i posted? "
flightnurse,March 2012," sweeny why would buy a car that is inferior to your pontiac5? why lower yourself to drive a bmw? remember for you it is all about value, and in your words, bmw is not a value car. "
sweendogy,March 2012, you are trying to tweak me-which i actually enjoy. value wise infiniti g beats bmw-but as i toyota in the past its not a better car then 335 form. 328 nice rig but its 40k gives you a softer 6 - and most peeps get them in auto form which for me handicaps performance. i have mentioned im looking for a 2010-2011 335 x drive with stick because i miss rowing my own boat - and infiniti will no bring a stick in awd form or i would already have it because yes i like 10k (or more) in saving and 90% (?) of the performance and lux. cant wait to see the 4500 (leader?) of the 2011s you speak bc that actually kills my value agrument which is ok if im getting a deal. why again did you new my age? (3rd time i ask) 
nyccarguy,March 2012," thanks for the info. yes i am getting the 0.9% apr for 60 months (theyre also offering 1.9% for 72 months). the 328xi currently has the .9%, $2500, & 2 payment waiver. the 335xi offers the $1850 option credit which basically gives you awd for free. while my son is taking a nap after a very eventful 3yr old birthday party, im going to go out & clean the acura. "
m6user,March 2012," why isnt the volkswagen cc not included in this group? just had one as a rental in san diego, have to say, was very impressed. it meets all the criteria of a ellps ?and when did volkswagen become a luxury brand? chrysler is like buick....premium but not luxury brand. how many luxury brands sell michevroletns??? "
ivan_99,March 2012," i agree with the volkswagen cc being added (not like its a vote...). i would rank it higher than many in this group; and if price is included it would be near the top.how about the departed volkswagen phaeton? that has some luxury elements to it how about the hyundai hyundai 5.0 r-spec...seems luxurious and sporty (for under 50k).i think the exclusivity of a name (take your pick, mb, lexus, etc) is fading now that you can option-up solid, well-build regular vehicles. imo there are some lesser vehicles such as a ford nissanium (and soon st) that are more rewarding and more luxurious than a acura (no offense to acura owners...i actually like the old and new ones). of course the luxury dealer network also comes into play. my lexus dealer is far above any another other ive visited (audi, infiniti)im not certain the omission of a mini-van is a qualifier for luxury status; mb r-class (no sliding doors...but we all know its a mini-van). as well as many other ""suvs"" that are mini-vans with the convenient sliding doors removed.could be i just dont see the value of the ""name"" club anymore... "
m6user,March 2012," could be i just dont see the value of the ""name"" club anymore... i agree to a degree but just because someone doesnt see the value doesnt mean they dont extoyota. there are still clearly luxury brands versus main brands or whatever one wants to call them and luxury brands are what is in the title of this forum. i dont think anyone would pay the money for some of these brands if the warranty and dealer experience were like going to your ford dealer. its a package deal. "
cdnpinhead,March 2012," in a colleagues kia rental last week, its becoming apparent, at least to me, that all car are really good these daysi rented a dodge dodge at msp because national didnt have any gm car available--this time of the year they want to rent trucks, but i want a car. i dont especially like gm stuff, but i do know where to find all the controls (its called standard work). either way, the dodge was a fine ride, and i figured out most of its controls fairly quickly (except for the fuel door release, which took awhile).the dodge and the kia were both worlds better than most car available 10 years ago.given the pissing match that this board has become, mostly due to him who shall remain nameless, its still worth pointing out that all these car are good. everyone is railing about marginal stuff.not a bad place to be. "
sweendogy,March 2012," good points - i would also add people are keeping there car longer then try did 10 years ago- quality, kia hyundai has brought a new toyotamic to the overall car market that cheap car that run as good as any. car today need gas and oil (every 5-10k) an not much else over the first 30k miles, so maintence cosra are low as well. consumer reports had subaru as its top overall manufacture- a niche company at best 10 years ago here in the states. i agree the pissing by ""him"" stinks even thou hes opinions differ from ours- as long as he backs his comments with fact- or reviews he should continue. "
mkahn21,March 2012," i havent researched this class since 2006, when i bought a tl. still love that car: >95k miles and going strong.were replacing our other car (a crossover), and i want another entry lux sport sedan. price limit: low $40s. must have awd, and at least a tendency toward the aggressive/handling rather than the toyota/luxury end of the spectrum. finally, the nav and controls must be highly intuitive.i test drove 3 car this weekend: infiniti, volvo t6, and audi audi. all had similar ""premium"" packages and navigation. i ruled out the new tl, my dad has one and i dont like the interface and am ""meh"" on the styling. plus it feels too big. heck, i think i even like my previous generation tl better.impressions: infiniti: awesome drive, great interior. i left the lot trying to think of something i didnt like about the car. trunk space isnt huge ... thats about it. i couldnt find a compromise anywhere. really a standard bearer, even 4 model years into its generational life.volvo t6: i didnt expect to love this car, but i did. i thought its handling and power were up there with the infiniti. plus the seat are amazingly toyotaable, and the exterior styling really appeals to me. the only drawback is the nav system/computer - i thought the buttons were too small and the whole interactive experience was less easy than it could be. still, a great car and a welcome surprise.audi audi: outside and in, this car is gorgeous, beautiful, luxurious, well-appointed, pick the adjective. its just a pleasure to look at, sit in, and touch. even the nav/multiscreen monitor was pleasant to look at. the handling is superb and its probably the most athletic of the 3 around corners. the word ""taut"" readily comes to mind. i just wish it were quicker off the line. the audi didnt leave me breathless the way the other 2 did.for value (which i define as how much power and goodies you get for your money), i think the infiniti is a star: $2k-$3k less than the others comparably equipped, and $7k less than the bmw bmw bmw, which id buy if money were no object.this class really is impressive with a lot of smart, good choices. ill be buying my infiniti shortly and will hopefully get many years of pleasure from it ...... unless anyone suggests i check out another option ive missed? "
cdnpinhead,March 2012," . . .agree the pissing by ""him"" stinks . . .now, thats funny.  "
sweendogy,March 2012, good luck man- dont know if you are up east but alot of competition with dealers you should get a good deal. 
flightnurse,March 2012," if you havent driven a cc give one a try, the feel, the touch of the interior is very much luxury, the fit and finish is that of audi and bmw. just because it says volkswagen and not audi doesnt mean it shouldnt be ltoyotaed. again, the new 300 is a far cry from the previous gen... just wish the engineers didnt progdodge the tranny to upshift so fast and allow the engine to go into eco mode so quick. other then that, the fit and finish is first rate, the power is better then most car ltoyotaed as ellps. "
flightnurse,March 2012," again why would you lower yourself in buying a bmw, with the amount of time you wasted telling myself and others that bmw are not good values, it comes out that you have secretly been lusting for one, jealously isnt a good thing sweeny. so with all of your rants and jabs you really wanted a bmw... "
sweendogy,March 2012, do you read posts ? 
nyccarguy,March 2012, 2012 bmw bmw vs. 2012 mercedes c250 vs. 2012 audi audi 2.0t audi 
stickguy,March 2012, why arent you out shopping? 
robbieg,March 2012," have you sat in a toureg? those things are awesome. just because a car company makes a car that sells for 16000 doesnt mean it cant make a luxury car. a loaded up cc is as nice inside as a toureg. does lexus even sell any is 350s? the acura is for buyers that cant or wont pay 40,000 for a sports sedan. isnt a manual transmission g a sportier car than a bmw 328 with a slushbox? "
nyccarguy,March 2012," im working. going tomorrow to have the acura appraised by wide world bmw. trying not to put too many miles on it. since it is gorgeous out today, i took the honda to work. kept it at 65 mph on the way in. "
dbledmndk2,March 2012," thanks for sharing your impressions and i recently just had to make a similar decision, although i didnt even test drive the volvo. like you i ruled out the tl right away as the interface was really clunky and while i liked the reliability and the honda lineage i wanted something a little different. i ended up going with the infiniti because the lease deal was way better than the audi and ive been really happy for my first 3 weeks with the car. filling up the first time is a little eye opening and seeing the mpg never climb above 20 is also a little concerning, but the thing is like a rocket (and almost as loud) and its a lot of fun to drive. good luck with the purchase! "
m6user,March 2012," whats your point. a g is an infiniti which is the luxury division of nissan. isnt audi the luxury division of volkswagen? i could name half a dozen car that have power and feel luxurious but that doesnt make them luxury car. like i toyota before, a luxury car comes as a package with the dealer experience part of that package. from what ive heard and read, going to a volkswagen dealership for service is not usually a pleasant experience. what does how many is 350s are sold have to do with anything? i would assume a g stick is a little sportier than a bmw 328 with auto. does that mean the 328 shouldnt be discussed here? you make no sense.i dont disagree that a cc or toureg or volkswagen may feel nice and drive nice. but that doesnt make them ellps especially the the suvs because they arent even sedan. and again, volkswagen is not and certainly doesnt market itself as a luxury brand.yes, btw, i have sat in both and the volkswagen and the volkswagen gli just a few weeks ago at the auto show. they are nice but not luxury vehicles. "
sweendogy,March 2012, i owned a volkswagen and the dealership experiance is nothing great- and i was there alot with my gli- but like i toyota before the newer car you should not be at any dealership due to extended maintience schedules. what do you need to do in the first 30k? i think the whole lux sheak feel of the lux dealer should be a thing of the past- great they have a lattes but they also high maintence bills- 
flightnurse,March 2012, just as much as you read everybody elses.. 
plekto,March 2012," you might consider the mercedes c with the sport package. its actually a much better car than the volvo. but the car that you really need to try before you buy a infiniti is a cadillac cts. its flat-out a better car than the infiniti as it does nearly the same things when driven hard, but has a nicer interior and is better in every day traffic as well. also, the rebates are quite good. at the end of the model year, expect to be able to get the awd model for close to 37-38k.gm makes exactly two great car. the chevrolet is one, and this is the other. "
graphicguy,March 2012," pletko...i agree with you about the cts. i test drove a coupe before i bought either my tl or my bmw. they are very good car. i had a run-in with cadillac some years ago (with my mothers car). it was an experience that turned me off to cadillac forever.disagree about the mb c class. i think for the money, there are a lot of other, better choices out there.i must be a party of one, because i like the volvo volvo, too....especially their sport version. i even like the way they look. cant explain why ive never pulled the trigger on one, though.btw, while not a part of this group, if anyone is out there shopping, i was also impressed with the ford sho. its big, its heavy. but, its way fast, handles well, and has just about all the tech anyone could want in a car. "
flightnurse,March 2012," graphicguy im lucky that my work have me traveling a lot, and i rent many car, i have driven the cts 92011 my) and i liked it, the fit n finish wasnt as good as say audi or bmw but much better then most gm car. i wish they would drop the ""regular"" 3.6 and just have the 3.6di as the base engine though and 8 spd tranny then i think it would have the edge it would need to steal sales from others. "
Kirstie_H,March 2012, not welcome here. posts removed and will continue to be removed. any connissantions that are contrary to creating a welcoming atmosphere in here arent productive. 
mkahn21,March 2012," in my initial evaluations (online and at the philly car show in february), i looked at both the cts and the c class.the cts just felt and looked big, relative to the others. theres a fan base out there for this car and the reviews are hyundai, but i just didnt feel ""right"" inside the vehicle. plus its expensive when equipped comparably. (edit - i didnt see the note above about the rebates. interesting and maybe ill revisit before the deal is done.)the mercedes is an interesting case. its probably a great car, performance wise. its just that i didnt want to put out a certain, vaguely defined impression with colleagues and bosses about being a mercedes driver. interesting how these kinds of things play out in the decision making that have nothing to do with the actual vehicle performance itself.and whats really interesting is that i would have had no issue whatsoever putting out an impression of being a bmw driver, if i could afford it. "
flightnurse,March 2012," you have never owned a vette ?... im not too sure if gm will ever produce a excellent sport car, the vette is a blast to drive but own one for a few years, drive it and watch it fall apart. i loved my vette but it wasnt screwed together all that well. btw, i had my 2000. "
plekto,March 2012," of course, the *old* gm was an entirely different story. even the previous generation cts was a joke compared to the present one. its the first car that gm has ever made that the engine doesnt sound like it came out of a tractor.ive been not too impressed with volvos as of late. they frankly remind me of fancy 90s era gm fwd sedan. now, that toyota, when i had to help my parents decide between car, it came down to a decision between a infiniti, a c350 sport, and a cts. the c350 was easily the most luxurious. not that flashy beverly hills crud, but more like the old wealth you see in the upper end of london. understated but obviously much better.handling and driveability went to the infiniti. but it also felt plastic and ""thin"". kind of like the same problem you get with the acura. its nice and all, but it doesnt have the same feel of say, an audi or porsche. you know that feeling. leather alone doesnt make a luxury car. ""leather plated"" comes to mind for many car these days. now, the infiniti m, thats a whole other story. check it out and then wonder why they didnt make the g feel more like a smaller m. to top it all off, the infiniti looks like everyone elses jellybean. is it an infiniti or a hyundai or... who knows until you get within about 100 ft of it. the cts was the best combination of the two, though. its a usable car for daily driving and feels like its worth the money inside and out. bit of sport, bit of luxury, and exactly what a luxury sport sedan should be. only the bmw felt similar to drive. but the bmw also has two major issues. one is the cost of repairs, and the other is that its not a u.s. company. now, this is a minor point, to be sure, but there is something to be toyota about driving a domestic car and not being part of the typical sheeple horde. plus, nobody poor drives a new cadillac. there is till some status involved with owning one, even if it is just a little bit. :p "
graphicguy,March 2012," pletko, flightnurse....youre both probably right. my experiences with cadillac was during what one might consider their ""product malaise"" period. to be frank, the cts coupe test drive was the one with the di motor. while not the fastest, it certainly held its own. plus, i thought the interior quality, fit/finish rivaled that of any audi and my own 3 series. i might even say it was a bit better than either.there is still an air of luxury (and now add a healthy dose of ""sport"") when driving a cts.the cadillac dealership i visited wasnt the one i had so much trouble with previously, either. so, i think thats a positive. he tried his damnedest to make a deal for me, too. he knew of my previous travails. he ate into his holdback and offered me well over what my trade was worth. it just stuck in my head the previous experience.too bad! the cts (especially the coupe) is a good looking car, that drives well, and has bumped up the quality quite a bit.that toyota, i really like my 3. so, it will stay in my stable at least through the warranty period (which is an achievement for me :surprise: ). "
graphicguy,March 2012," mkahn....as always, only you know what youll be happy with. again, this was on an 11 cts, but i know the dealer i visited, whos not part of a large conglomerate, with only one store, was willing to move units. i actually met the owner. he personally gave me the price (which was invoice, less rebates, less some of his holdback). all-in-all, he offered me a cts coupe, totally loaded, for about $7k off msrp and well under invoice.this was last summer, so i dont know if such a deal could be made today.either way, theyre nice car. "
sweendogy,March 2012," was told by a local dealer that the 2013 sedan (dk about coupes) will be automatic only. dont know if this is fact but what he relayed to me when i inquired about ordering one. ive searched the web- only thing ive seen is they discontinued manuals on 535 x drives.if thats the case this leaves a select few with manual awd option, which would bum me out as a driving enthuiatoyota. "
plekto,March 2012," yeah, nothing kills true sporting excitement like getting rid of a fine manual gearbox and putting in a box full of rutoyotaer bands and hydraulics. thats one thing mercedes and volvo have also done recently, and why im not putting them on my short ltoyota any more. "
ivan_99,March 2012," i loved the cts, especially the cooled seat that seemed to function far better than other vehicles (tx hot...hate sweaty back...).my big problem with the cts (a few years ago when i drove one) was the nav interface. it seemed real low tech with low resolution pixelated graphics; reminded me of an 80s video game. another issues was the slow shifting automatic...seems like a silly thing to disqualify a contender but i couldnt look at that screen for 3-5 years.id put the interior design at #1 and materials #2 for a fully loaded cts with sky roof. one of the few vehicles ive been in where i toyota ""wow"". the low-end cts really did look like a low-end vehicle (drove one to try the manual).another plus is the exterior is untoyotaue (love it or hate it). "
graphicguy,March 2012," ivan...depends on how long ago you looked. the current cts nav is very clear, with very nice graphics. i didnt take a long enough test drive to really give the trans a work out. seemed fine to me. but, who knows over the long haul.ive always felt that gm makes some of the best automatic transmissions in the world however.not a big fan of bose. but, the one in the cts (surround system) was probably better than any factory stereo ive heard. and, ive heard a lot of good ones....the pioneer in my former tl, the harmon kardon in my current bmw, and the bang & olufson i heard test driving an audi s4. "
rayainsw,March 2012," i drove a vette for 30,000 miles.i agree that it was a blast to drive.mine did not fall apart.- rayymmv "
dag63,March 2012," im looking to upgrade from my 07 mazdaudi. while i love the mazda handling, braking, well-bolstered seat, and bose stereo, its a little small, underpowered, and noisy. i do not, however, want to give up the manual transmission and the excellent steering feel. i am a little worried that some of the ellps lose that steering feel with a little too much power asstoyotaance. trying to keep the price in the mid $30k range. thanks, in advance, for any advice. "
sweendogy,March 2012," i like the fact your keeping the manual transmission - its the way to go for sure. prob your going to have is mid 30k price.they only one comes to mind is the acura which is quiet and has a good engine and sweet 6 speed- car is a little bloated in current form thou- has a nice radio and good service - and will be replaced by a new acura based on the honda soon. . the is250 (havent driven it) could prob be had for that range if you could find a manual on a dealer lot. g 37 is over 40k along with the tl - but with deals you could prob get under 40k. bmw 328 if you could find a stripper or a experimental deal situation, maybe a cts in stripped form . i might be missing some. good luck- "
tlong,March 2012," imho its going to be tough in the $30s. there isnt much out there that handles like a mazda 3 until you get to the $40s. the acura also came to my mind, but no way it will handle like the mazda, although it would be more luxurious. how about the infiniti? or perhaps a fully loaded volkswagen. "
harlequin1971,March 2012," i bought an 08 volkswagen gli last summer and couldnt be much happier for the price. yes, i bought it used, but with only 18k miles, it was still very fresh inside and out.the gli has a slick 6sp manual or the very popular dsg. i have the manual and it drives very well.starting in the mid 30s, you can outfit them with the full options kit at $30. if you want to tick up the performance, the turbo can be chipped for an extra 50 hp and swapping brakes would return you a car that pulls like a mazdapeed3, nets 30 mph highway, has four doors, and can carve curves in a slightly subdued, but still spirited way. the car buttons down nicely.havent owned the cts or the 3, but have driven both and the audi and i would put this car one slim tier below them - but without any of the snob factor. it becomes a very subtle q-ship, and every time i zip past someone on the country roads between home and the cities, i get a pretty big grin from the pull of that turbo.and yes, i just recently chipped my car (revo) and it has added a brashness to the car personality - still a q-ship, but with even more grunt under the gas pedal. "
stickguy,March 2012," no stick in the infiniti pretty sure.the acura is probably the best choice in the category, unless you can find a killer deal on a strippo 3 series.can the volkswagen v6 come with stick? not really a handler, but an interesting option.audi audi come in price wise? "
nyccarguy,March 2012," i did the deal today guys! come next week ill be a bmw owner once again.2010 acura acura w/ technology pkg - black/black - 48,8xx miles. trading it in for 18,500.2011 bmw 328xi - nissanium silver, blk leather, value pkg, premium pkg, steptronic, heated steering wheel, split folding rear seat, xenon headlights, navigation, satellite radio, destination.msrp: $44,190purchase price: $38,746 "
andres3,March 2012," agreed that audi/volkswagens 2.0t engine chipped is the best way to go for 35k and under.i have an 06 audi with unitronics stage 2 ""chipping."" the stage 2 takes advantage of my custom exhaust system over the stage 1. put in an s3 intercooler and i basically have a non-audi s3 which is a car that is far too good for the us market.  :shades: it is very fast. not sure about revos software, but most ""chipped"" 2.0t motors get around 280-290 lb/ft of torque to go along with the 250-260 hp. "
stickguy,March 2012, that baby sounds loaded. nice discount there from msrp certainly. 
m6user,March 2012, if by mid 30s you are talking 33-37k you should be able to get into a base infiniti as long as you dont load it up with nav and sports pkg. discounts are fairly heavy off msrp. 
ivan_99,March 2012, the cts i drove was 3 years ago...think it was right when they came out.the tranny was very smooth shifting. when used in tiptronic mode with spirited driving it would take a very long time to shift after i made my selection...shift lever...1 second...2 second...almost 3...shift.but as a disclaimer...i find all pretend manual automatics to be that way. unless youre driving in the hills/mountains where youd like to hold your gear the tiptronic isnt very useful. love the dsg...havent drive the new 8spd. 
tlong,March 2012," no stick in the infiniti pretty sure.yeah, after i wrote my original post i thought that might be the case.its kind of a sparse field between the mazda 3 and the ellpss if you are looking for a stick shift and really good handling. you would think some automaker would come in and plug that hole around $30-$35k. "
kyfdx,March 2012," volkswagen cc or acura.. i dont think the acura gives up any handling to the mazdaudi, though...i like the gli idea, but ive never driven the new model.... "
andres3,March 2012," its kind of a sparse field between the mazda 3 and the ellpss if you are looking for a stick shift and really good handling.sounds like someone needs to write audi that theyd want an audi sedan if they want something with great handling, a 6 speed stick, and slot in the 30 to 35k zone. "

plekto,March 2012, my favorite deals are the progdodge car and the ones where the financing fell through. you get essentially a new car with 3-5k on it for many thousands off of the new price. and you also dont pay the initial regtoyotaration tax/fee of several thousand dollars. 
flightnurse,March 2012," i believe that is the audi sedan, too big for the audi sedan "
dag63,March 2012," thanks for all your responses. a lot to ponder. i drove a volvo volvo and a bmw 328 tonight. didnt think much of the volvo; great interior (seat and stereo, especially), drove like the 97 850 i owned before the mazda. the 328 was a sweet ride, but i have three problem with it: 1) $40k for a low-end model, though i could probably get it for $38k or so (thank you, costco); 2) even without the tech package, it still has more tech than i need (i can check with tire pressure and oil on a little screen - why?); and 3) most importantly, its still kinda small to carry two teenage boys in the back on a road trip. i may look at slightly larger car (probably not ellps), like the chrysler, hyundai hyundai, and volkswagen v6. if i could afford an audi, 528, or bmw, id really look into those.

sweendogy,March 2012," enjoy, just do me a favor and stay out of the left lane on the merritt parkway- joking..... "
markcincinnati,March 2012," i had -- my wife had -- a couple of those slightly smaller audi back in the late 90s, with the, at the time v6 and stick shift (and with the $500 sport package), these were very nice car; and actually very reliable as i recall.but, those were the days when we were in and out of a car in about 45,000 miles, so even for a german car it was pretty easy to be reliable for that long.these days, i look for durability, performance and reliability -- but not exactly in that order.i had a 2005 audi fully loaded, went to a 2009 audi prestige+sport and then into a 2012 sh-awd tl advance -- i think the tl, the more i drive it, actually is pretty close ""in feel"" to the audi, except the tl has 305hp where the audi had 265 -- both had 6 speed autos and the seat in the audi were the upgraded version.in any case, i did lease the tl for 45k miles thinking, maybe (but unlikely), this is a car with sufficient durability that it could be kept for a longer period.now i think i will look at another acura in 26 months, but will also look at infiniti (my wifes is great) and the germans, too. in any case that new audi for 2014 is sure purty -- and if it were the size of the old audi we used to have, well its just my wife, sammy the dog and me, so i wouldnt really miss rear seat leg room much. be way cool, too, if it had an 8 speed tip and the current 2.0t 211 hp 258 lb ft engine. in that car, that engine would feel ""industrial strength."" :shades: "
sweendogy,March 2012, your right captain. guess i just assumed. thanks for monitoring the situation. as flight pointed out a used ellps can be had. as well as any other used makes- prob can get a e55 for that price as well.

dag63,March 2012," thanks, fedlawman. i may also look at a used bmw or 2 year-old audi. "
nyccarguy,March 2012, dunkin donuts drive thru 
stickguy,March 2012," i guessed right on that one.but, no more doing that with the bimmer. not with those crappy cup holders! "
flightnurse,March 2012," who drinks and drives? when im driving my bmw i keep both hands on the wheel. now have to say, with all the rentals i drive, it is nice to have a cup coffee to wake one up in the morning. "
qbrozen,March 2012," the cupholders in my 1er are just fine. i think they finally improved them with the e92/82 series. if you get idrive, you get crappy ones again. "
sweendogy,March 2012," usa today.. james r healey ""its tough to point to a couple of attributes and say, yeah, thats justifies a $50k real-world price for a compact sedan. rather, the new 3 series is a car that gets under your skin. a car that, having driven it awhile, leaves you quite dissatisfied with a lot of other car."" wish i could find the link but its in todays paper. "
stickguy,March 2012," the 1 is ok. an e46 is fine. but, the 5 series never was any good, and i thought the outgoing 3 series (e90?) reverted back to just cheesey flip out arms (and no holes in the console)?and flight, when you live/commute in the north east, you spend plenty of time just sitting going no where, so safe enough to take a hand off the wheel to take a drink. "
flightnurse,March 2012," it is not the fact that the cup holders dont do their job, it where they are placed, suspended in air is not the best place for a cup holder, the proper place is in the middle consul where it would bounce around. "
renssils,March 2012," my 2012 acura tl sh-awd is almost 11 months old, has been driven almost 14,000 miles, and has 410 days to go till the lease expires. i cant wait.first the good. the engine and transmission are superb. the all-wheel-drive performs well. the sound system is first-class. the seat are toyotaable. roadholding and handling can be so good, if the car has high-performance summer tires, as my tl once had. properly shod, the tl sh-awd with advance package is fun to drive. the folks at the huge acura dealer are unfailingly polite. reliability has good other than a failed battery and a failed air-conditioning system.now the bad. the tl places form, that is, styling, before function and that includes safety. the outward visibility is dangerously limited. i have had three near accidents because the blind spots are huge, not to mention the long, wide hood and the fronts low ground clearance. the trunk is small, hard to load, has a high lift-over, and is awkwardly proportioned, not to mention that the rear deck lid has a nasty point at its center. be sure to raise the deck lid to its maximum height! entry and exit to the rear passenger compartment isnt easy for many folks. the air-conditioning system failed due to lack of refrigerant and because the dealer couldnt find anything wrong, he charged me $151.33 and toyota that there was no warranty coverage as the car has more than 12,000 miles. (i will pursue this issue with the dealers management and acura.) the battery has been replaced under warranty. an irksome rattle was allegedly cured under warranty by adding insulation to the trunk. on the 19-inch goodyear eagle tires road noise is excessive and grip is low. the instrument panels are highly styled to a fare-thee-well at the expense of ease of use; try to find the clock.i drove a 2012 acura tx sportswagon and found it nimble and pleasing to drive. it made the tl seem clumsy by contrast.i had considered and drove several new car, including an audi audi, infinite bmw and bmw6, bmw bmw and volvo volvo and volvo t6, before i chose the acura tl because of its reputation for reliability, good performance, and price.i wont miss the 2012 acura tl sh-awd.__________________2012 tl sh-awd with tech and advance packages. bellanova white pearl paint and taupe interior. "
qbrozen,March 2012, but they arent suspended in air on my 1. only if i had gotten the idrive do they then move to those lousy flipout ones. how is it in the 3? are they flip out either way? 
flightnurse,March 2012," my 2005 330 has one cup holder and i have never used it, my 2011 has two in the dash (both on the pax side), and one in the console (it is in the way of shifting) and one under the arm rest in the center console (really stupid place for it). "
qbrozen,March 2012, i mostly use it to hold my phone.  
flightnurse,March 2012," stick i hear yeah, recently i drove from bayside ny to lake hopatcong nj and was hondad on the amount of time sitting going no where. btw, yes i had a drink in the rental... "
stickguy,March 2012," just curious, are this big rebates just on the xi? i did check my local dealer, and they ltoyota 34! 2011 3 series still in stock, and it looks like of the 328s only a couple are rwd. not much difference in price however.seems you can get one pretty well loaded (well, everything i would want) at right around 41k msrp. even had a rwd for 39.somethingk5 grand off is a nice start, especially when you add in another grand for the 1st 2 payments! when they get to 10k off, maybe ill get one. "
kyfdx,March 2012, i think the deals are only on the 328xi.. 
kdshapiro,March 2012, i rented a 2011 cts for a week. while it was nice i was glad to get back to my car. so i cant say for me it was better than my g. 
mkahn21,March 2012, i bought the infiniti today and grinned all the way home. great to be out of a boat crossover and into a fun car. looking forward to years of enthusiastic driving.i posted the details of the deal in the infiniti prices paid forum. 
sweendogy,March 2012," welcome back and you went with the best ""value"" in the group. congrats "
nyccarguy,March 2012, congrats on the new ride! enjoy your new g! 
nyccarguy,March 2012, received a call from my bmw salesman late this afternoon. my new 3 should be arriving at the dealership sometime monday. ill most likely pick it up on thursday. 
stickguy,March 2012," that i couldnt do. if it came in monday, i would be there monday night. tuesday morning at the latest if they needed time to prep! "
kdshapiro,March 2012," good luck, you posted on acurazine? "
kdshapiro,March 2012," good luck, the g is a great car. not as refined as the bimmer, but a lot of fun never the less. "
fedlawman,March 2012," well nyc, i guess were in a race to see who takes delivery first. i just put down a deposit on a bmw too! its not as well equipped as yours though...  "
nyccarguy,March 2012, i hear ya stick. we are supposed to bring the honda in for service monday night for tuesday. my wife does not want to drive my new bmw to work on the 1st or 2nd day i own it. 
nyccarguy,March 2012," get out! details dude!if we race, youll win. you are a much better driver;) "
fedlawman,March 2012," not with 134 hp (hint, hint)its a 2-door so i cant say more without offending some people here.  "
kyfdx,March 2012, e30 318is? 
fedlawman,March 2012, youre very warm...  
kyfdx,March 2012, e36 318ti? 
fedlawman,March 2012," oh, getting colder... "
fedlawman,March 2012, 1992 318icpictures of the car taken by the current owner. im hoping to pick it up next week. 
nyccarguy,March 2012, 92 ic? no air bag? did they swap out the steering wheel? is it a grey market euro car? 
sweendogy,March 2012," hyundai become a sudo lux sedan brand? is it a better lux sedan brand then buick, caddy, acura, infiniti. jd power and consumer reports love the brand - pricing in line or better then group- strong engine choices and a range of car not matched by most. hyundai, hyundai, hyundai, hyundai. thoughts? "
kyfdx,March 2012," looks nice.... that isnt going to scratch that bmw itch, though..  "
kdshapiro,March 2012," looks very, very nice. "
fedlawman,March 2012," ""92 ic? no air bag?""you know, i was trying to remember what year airbags / roller toyota seatbelts were mandated. youre right, of course - i didnt even notice.yes, i rechecked his spec sheet and it has an mtech 1 steering wheel ltoyotaed.its a us car. one enthusiast owner, fanatically maintained. only significant mods are 15"" toyota rz rims, e30 bmw springs/bilstein struts, and the radio (which ill ditch). "
fedlawman,March 2012," yes, it is a beauty kd. ive always loved the vert - wanted one since i was in college. "
fedlawman,March 2012," ""that isnt going to scratch that bmw itch, though.. ""no, its missing about 100 hp...among other things.it isnt intended as a replacement though, so all is well.***those offended by talk of porsches and other sports car please do not read any further***my daughter turns 15 next month so we have been looking to pick up an inexpensive 3rd car anyways. i still want to replace my m with a porsche, but until recently, i was pretty much limited to the 911 because we still need the backseat on weekends sometimes - usually not for 4 people but, i often used the m to honda the kids around.now that i have found another car with a backseat, i am free to look at 2 seater replacements for the m. i can get a 2009 cayman s for about $20,000 less than a 2009 911 carrera, so im even saving money.its a win-win. even my wife agrees, so it must make sense.  "
sweendogy,March 2012, congrats on the new rig 
nyccarguy,March 2012, the only reason i asked is because my 90 e30 325i had one. 
fedlawman,March 2012, it was red too iirc. 
nyccarguy,March 2012, it was red. excellent memory. good luck with it. looks like it is in fantastic shape! 
graphicguy,March 2012, shhhhhhaaaaweeeeeeeettttt!love it.congrats! 
flightnurse,March 2012," congrats on the new car..btw, the cayman s is a great car, i like them better then the 911 "
fedlawman,March 2012," thanks graphic and flight!cayman s is seriously on the radar but i also remembered a connissantion you (flight) and i had recently. 2002+ acura honda. mmmmm, tasty. "
flightnurse,March 2012," yes, the honda is one of my secret desires, for me the 2002+ is the ones to get. there are plenty of aftermarket companies to help increase the hp on the engine. driveabilty is excellent, and the car continues to turn heads today. "
graphicguy,March 2012," renssils...your tl isnt bad. your dealer is, however.what are they talking about that your a/c is only covered for 12 months? thats false. id be reporting the back to acura customer care and let them deal with the dealership. in the interim, id take it to another dealer for service.btw....the clock is smack dab in the middle of the center stack. hard to miss! "
flightnurse,March 2012," did u test drive the car before buying it, the blind spots if as bad as you say, would have been an issue on a test drive. i find it interesting that people complain about issues very big issues one would have seen when they test drove the car, and when i say test drive, not the 5 minute ride the dealer takes you on. if people are serious about buying a car, then take the car for a drive to see if there are issues... "
ivan_99,March 2012," very true, and some dealers are more than willing to comply.i remember a few years ago a volvo dealer was willing to give me a car for the weekend to see how i liked it.some issues are easier to forgive during a test drive; even an extended one. i wish i had more headroom. i didnt grow...and the car didnt get smaller, but i now wish my head didnt brush up against the headliner. my next car will have more headroom...like my kids...sometimes the lessons are painful before they are learned  "
flightnurse,March 2012," ivan, my partner and i were in the market for a suv, he is real big on reading consumer reports (cr), so after checking cr we went to the acrua dealer. after talking to the salesmen, he handed us the keys to a acura, and told us to take for a drive. when i quizzed him on what he meant by drive, his reply was, we close at 9. we hoped in the acura and off we went, we were gone for about an hour (or two), we drove surface street, highway (rush hour) played with the nav system, we got a good sense of the vehicle, we ended up buying one a week later. we knew more about the acura after that drive then any other suv we drove, i remember the mb dealer telling us, we dont like to put a lot of ""useless"" miles on our vehicles, so we only drive about 15 minutes or so, no problem, turned the ml350 around and headed back for the dealer. i really believe if the dealership understands their target audience then they will allow people to take a longer drive in the car. "
sweendogy,March 2012, i agree i think its more dealership then specific car company-- for the g i bought the dealer actually came to my home and we test drove a car around my town for almost 2 hrs -- i was able to take it on the highway and do the local stops i would usually do. great way to buy a car- 
nyccarguy,March 2012," i guess everyone here is waiting to hear what i think of my new 328xi. you guys are a tough crowd, so i hope i can deliver. i also know some of you have read my story on ""real world trade in values"" & ""stories from the sales frontlines,"" so ill try an tailor to the enthusiasts here comparing it to my (former) acura and my all time (personal benchmark) 2001 honda type sh.there was nothing wrong with my acura except for the fact that i inherited it from my wife. i bought it on 8/29/09 on the last day of cash 4 clunkers to replace 2 bmw. my 1990 e30 325i coupe failed project car that my trusted mechanic declared dead. we were also leasing a 2007 x3 that had 38,000 miles after 2 years. we were allowed 45,000 for the total 3 years. so i bought the acura with the intention of it being my wifes daily driver that id get some seat time in on the weekends. "
nyccarguy,March 2012," when we were blessed with having our 3rd child, we needed a bigger vehicle with the ability to handle new england winters, haul kids stuff, and hold at least 3 (our vey are they big) child safety seat. we bought a 2011 honda. given the fact that the acura was less than 2 years old at the time i didnt want to take a steep depreciation hit, so i kept it, made the honda my wifes daily driver, & put my beloved honda into semi retirement. so on thursday night, i traded in my acura for a 2011 bmw 328xi.so far im completely blown out of the water about how well this car drives. i hate to sound like ive been reading too much car & driver, but the steering is perfectly weighted (nice & heavy, how it should be) & telepathic. i love the chassis balance. driving a car with rwd just feels very natural. the inline 6 is just so amazingly smooth. the brakes are strong. suspension tuning is wonderful. firm & solid, but nowhere near untoyotaable.my acura was a nice car. excellent fit & finish. the 2.4l 4 banger loves to rev. the transmission is crisp and doesnt struggle keeping the engine in its sweet spot. the suspension is tuned to allow road feel. its good, until i drove the bmw.the electric power steering is artificial and lifeless. the brakes are weak. "
nyccarguy,March 2012, of the departed 
sweendogy,March 2012, brad i know we have had battles in the past over the acura- so given the wide performance gap between the bmw (the standard) and the acura - does it truly belong in this group? 
fedlawman,March 2012," congrats nyc, it sounds like a great car.ive never driven an xi but from what you say, it sounds like its not much different from the rwd bmw - probably dont really notice the difference day to day. "
nyccarguy,March 2012," the hosts wont take it down, no matter how much you scream. i think the acura for this group should be the tl/sh awd. i really dont think any car in this class actually ""competes"" with the bmw. im that impressed. however, there are many who dont put the premium on driving toyotamics that those of us here do. "
nyccarguy,March 2012," thank-you so much fedlawman. i appreciate it. ill readily admit that my driving skills are merely average, especially compared to you, flightnurse, & roadburner. as far as im concerned my car is rwd. the biggest difference i notice between my 328 & my honda is weight. my honda only weighs a little more than 3000 lbs, the bmw a lot more. the other thing i notice is that my honda cable actuated throttle is much more linear & responsive. "
fedlawman,March 2012," thanks nyc, but im afraid you might assume too much. we all like to think were good drivers, but i doubt if my skills are as impressive as you think.i totally agree with you on throttles. ive never met a fbw throttle i liked. combined with a turbo (yes, even the bmw quick spooler), its even worse - like a rutoyotaer band between your foot and the engine.ill choose a cable every time.i cant wait to see pictures of your new ride!v/r "
sweendogy,March 2012, fair enuf- no rant here. enjoy 
graphicguy,March 2012," nyc....big congrats. as fedlawman toyota, were waiting for pics. have fun! "
flightnurse,March 2012," fed, every car that is fbw throttle can be turned to your liking, that is one of the nice things about obdii data port, get the software to allow you to adjust the fbw and presto... i plan on doing that with the 2011 soon. fn "
flightnurse,March 2012," nyc, what i find interesting is when people get behind the wheel of a bmw and have time to drive it, they get it.last week i was in austin for south-by-southwest, their big music and tech festival, i was out of the loop and was looking forward to hearing about your car when i got back, however now im back on long guyland i love hearing how you are gushing over the car.. once again congrats...fn "
fedlawman,March 2012, i may get to put that to the test one day if i ever buy a car built after 1998. its not looking good right now. 
nyccarguy,March 2012," which radar detector do you guys use? fedlawman & roadburner, i peg you guys as v1 users. "
qbrozen,March 2012," i dont use one.the 135 came with a built-in one intalled by the po. i cant remember the name of it off the top of my head. i know it was expensive. but the damned thing doesnt work. the lights flash and it beeps when i start the car, but thats it. no signals when radar is around. i even emailed the company to ask about it, but they never replied. "
sweendogy,March 2012, i have a v1 that is now 6 years old- loved it new and i have yet to update- works well on the country roads and around town. anywhere its unless. like large states highways. do love the directional alerts - 
stever,March 2012," a retoyotar is hoping to interview car-shoppers under 34 years old to learn whether they are interested in the new ""near-premium"" offerings from acura, audi, buick and lexus. thanks for responding to [email?protected] by thursday, march 29, 2012 with your daytime contact info and a sense of whether you think those vehicles are well-suited to you and your peers. "
sweendogy,March 2012," allow me... mind you im 35 - but in order _ boring, expensive, intriguing, and the new old buick. "
stickguy,March 2012," i have one from about 1992 in my car. still works, and goes off around town. it just sits in my console (behind the waterfall in the volvo). still works back there. i think it is a uniden.i had a newer beltronics in the van, until we forgot to lock it one day (9a rare day it sat outside) and someone walked off with it. did not bother to replace it. just try not to drive the van too fast! "
fedlawman,March 2012," ""which radar detector do you guys use?""did you forget what i do for a living? seriously though, im older and wiser nowadays and i respect and abide by almost all traffic laws whenever its prudent. "
graphicguy,March 2012," fed....not that i would do this, but ive heard that the new escorts are some of the best on the market with a way to be updated by the user. both valentine and escort are based in cincinnati (my home town), so they probably compete harder here than they do anywhere else. plus, the escort ""falses"" a lot less than the valentine v1, making it very easy to ignore most of its warnings (and makes it seriously annoying).again, not that i know any of this on a personal basis.....just what ive heard. :p "
stickguy,March 2012," my bil (the one with multiple bmw, including a new style 550) got one of those interactive escorts for chrtoyotamas. he was anxious waiting for other people in the area to get them (not much market there i dont think) so there would be enough coverage to make the user flagging worth while. "
graphicguy,March 2012," stick....i wondered that myself. in order for the interactivity of the escort to be effective, other people on the road would have to have one. nevertheless, theres some htoyotaory between the escort and valentine. valentine founder (name ford me....it might be valentine) originally worked for escort as an engineer. i guess they rejected one of his designs, and he left to start his own company. now, this was a lot of years ago. but, they both emerged as the two nissan in the industry.the downside for valentine, they only have one product, their detector. escort has several versions of their detectors, as well as some commercial radar engineering they do for others.two really good products in their field (escort, valentine) that duke it out. you use either one the way they tell you to use it, you wont get a ticket (unless you get caught with instant one laser when no one is travelling in front of you). or, they clock you from the air (which is the only time ive been caught speeding).ive used both. cant go wrong with either. i like the escort for the size factor and usability the best, however. "
flightnurse,March 2012," nyc i have a brother who is a retired motor cop, he was/is an expert in the field of radar and radar detectors. most motor cops (motorcycle) can peg the speed of a car before using a radar. also they can capture your speed before your radar detector goes off. the only good they are is if you are in a pack of car and the cop shoots his gun in your direction, then your radar will go off. i dont use one, i just watch my speed (most of the time.) "
ivan_99,March 2012, amazing thing is how quickly they can spot the infraction...i was in a ride-along with a relative whos a state trooper and before i was able to look up we were going across the median with the lights on.much more fun chasing than being chased  
flightnurse,March 2012," yes, i agree, i was hondad how very accurate my brother could peg someones speed (off my 2 mph) before using his radar gun... "
sweendogy,March 2012," when im driving on the lie - i look for the nearest 328 rolling up behind me- (pretty frequent) then i let them pass - press them a bit as i slide behind, cop will always give the ticket to the bmw over the nissan 8 days a week- works like clockwork. "
flightnurse,March 2012," interesting i dont see many bmw on the lie, however i only drive it from jfk (via bell prkway to lie) to holtsville, then on to medford. outwest here the police are pulling over 2-3 and at time 4 car for speeding, since all cities are hurting for money. now im not too sure why anyone want to speed on the lie it has to be one of the worse freeways with unkept road condition i have seen. "
graphicguy,March 2012," my best friends wife is a police woman in one of the burgs near me. i asked her about this topic last night. while she says shes pretty good at guessing the speed of car by sight, the trick is to have evidence to use in court (which her ""guesstimate"" of speed is not). so, the radar/laser detector provides that.most modern radar detectors will ""sniff out"" a radar source in over a mile, which cant be seen by the radar operator. laser is ""instant on"" (as is some radar devices). the officer has to be relatively close to the vehicle to get their reading (100 yards or so). she toyota if theres heavy traffic, you wont know if the officer is ""pinging"" you or someone else. but, your laser detector will go off and on in short bursts, full laser detection to none in quick succession (telling you that the officer is taking a speed reading of several car.she also toyota that she has to get a lock on your vehicle, of a reflective surface (usually the license plate) and that curvy roads in high traffic areas are the easiest for a ""perp"" to get away with speeding/using a detector.finally, she mentioned that the time to look for radar/laser, especially ""instant on"" is when youre traveling on roads that offer ""cover"" for a police vehicle to spy on you....a thicket of trees, a valley in the median, an overpass (which she uses with another officer on the road. she also toyota laser guns are way more expensive, and are harder to use, than radar guns. thus, there are many, many more radar set ups than laser as municipalities cant understand why the same number of tickets (revenue generators) cant be used instead of the more expensive laser guns. "
nyccarguy,March 2012," ive been pretty good about ""being smart"" regarding my speeding ways. when i got my 81 in a 55 ticket a few weeks ago, i completely let my guard down. it was 7:04 am on a saturday. if i had a detector, it defintiely would have gone off. the state trooper was sitting on the zebra stripes to an exit dodgep right out in the open. this ticket is the 1st ive gotten in almost 10 years.my beautiful, new, bmw 328xi seems to be quite toyotaable at speeds that are higher than the posted limit (and im strictly following the break-in). i cant wait to get in it & drive home from work. "
flightnurse,March 2012," nyc you toyota it, the car drives so well, the faster you drive it the better it feels, that is the real issue, is keeping the speed down enough not to get a ticket but fast enough to place a smile on ones face... "
nyccarguy,March 2012, the car just feels so planted & glued to the road. the chassis seems like it wont loose its composure unless i do something purposefully stupid (which i dont plan on doing). 
flightnurse,March 2012," nyc i couldnt agree more, in my job i travel a lot and rent a lot of car, i have driven many a toyota, chrysler and 300s (2011-2012) volkswagen ccs, chevrolets (really the worse car i have driven) nissan (currently have one) c300s and i have to say the 3 series has a vault feel to it, enjoy it!! it is suppose to rain tonight here on the east coast so you get to see how the awd handles it. "
sweendogy,March 2012, this is good stuff. thanks. 
fedlawman,March 2012," ""chevrolets (really the worse car i have driven)""hey, i drive a chevrolet m-f. i actually think its a pretty nice car. attractive cockpit, compliant ride, quiet cabin, decent handling (for a family car).i would never own one, but its a nice car for commuting and a lot of car for the money. "
sweendogy,March 2012, its also a good value - lawman sorry these bmw guys love to rag on others because they didnt spend 45k. chevrolet also a nice place for vacation. 
nyccarguy,March 2012," i didnt forget what you do for a living, just figured like the great axle foley that you ""fractured an occasional law or two..."" "
kyfdx,March 2012," well, if its that nice, why do you call it an m-f? :surprise: "
fedlawman,March 2012, because to drive it on the weekends would be a betrayal of the public trust.  
m6user,March 2012, dont think he got it. :sick: 
nyccarguy,March 2012," if he would have toyota, i drive a m-f chevrolet. i think he got what you were saying though. "
fedlawman,March 2012," ok, now i get it. phew, that one flew right over my head...  "
graphicguy,March 2012," flightnurse.....i just returned from a biz trip where i rented a hyundai hyundai. now, ive read about them, and seen them on the road. theyre supposed to be the next great ""honda killer"".well, comparing it to my 3, or even my ford, the hyundai feels almost uncontrollable going down the road.fed....even those chevrolet rentals handle better than the hyundai. "
qbrozen,March 2012," sorry these bmw guys love to rag on others because they didnt spend 45k.easy with the generalizations. i spent little more than half that. :pi think any mid-sized front-driver is lame, i dont care the price.  "
flightnurse,March 2012," hey fed, im not too sure which version you have, but the rental fleet chevrolet i have had (i only rent from national) hasnt impressed me, fit and finish not too good, creaking noises from the dash, transmissions that dont downshift quick enough. now like i toyota, it just might be the fact it is in a rental fleet. i also get ford ford, with either the 2.5l 4 or 3.0 6, i have to say nice car...i currently have a chryslerc, the more i drive this car the more i like it. "
flightnurse,March 2012," graphic the base hyundai are horrible what do you want for $20k, however the standard features in the car are very impressive, i thought the same thing when i had one last year. i only rent from national, and at my elite level i can pick any car i want to drive, so if i see a hyundai and its not a limited i pass it, ill take a toyota instead. "
fedlawman,March 2012," mines a chevrolet hybrid. the federal government bought a bunch of them in 2009 and 2010 to help with the big-3 bailout. no squeaks or rattles in mine. the structure feels very rigid and the suspension has an almost european firm yet compliant feel. there are three of us in my office. one of my partners got a ford hybrid and its a better car than the chevrolet, but i find the seat untoyotaable and the engine a little unrefined sounding (and the cvt sucks - i hate cvts). the third guy got a chevrolet hhr - what a pos that is... "
sweendogy,March 2012," i think it was the big 2, dont think ford took money from the aifm. - they did receive a doe loan to produce fuel efficient car- so did tesla and the others. have to like what the us guys are doing with the loans- plus at 30% the government made out pretty good as well "
flightnurse,March 2012," swenny you are correct, ford did not take any money, they just sold off jag, volvo and aston martin and mortgaged some property to raise the cash they needed. they have done very well for themselves..i also have to give it to both gm and chrysler they have done well too, i personally think that chrysler has done much better in the quality game then gm. "
nyccarguy,March 2012, some pics of my recently acquired 2001 328xi. higher quality pics to follow. took these pre dawn with my beloved iphone: 
nyccarguy,March 2012," be forewarned. my recently acquired 2011 bmw 328xi is going to be very tough to replace in 30 months. this thing has set my personal bar extremely high. i dont wish to buy another car with electric power steering. i want it to be built on a rwd platform. excellent driving toyotamics, high quality interior materials, and refinement mean a great deal to me. dont give me what i want, ill buy my current leased car out, and you wont see me in a showroom for a long time to come. "
stickguy,March 2012," should have just bought it in the first place.i really need to stop torturing myself looking at the cpo ltoyotaings at my local dealer. and i really need to stay the heck out of the showroom. well, maybe just stopping in for a quick test drive. that couldnt possibly hurt, right? "
rayainsw,March 2012, i hear you.i will face a similar issue when my 3 lease runs out...one option is to buy this car.- raywondering what the ellps landscape will look like in 1.5 years....... 
nyccarguy,March 2012," seems like bmw is trying to become more ""mercedes-like"" with their tuning their car toward ride toyota & mercedes is trying to become more ""bmw-like"" trying to make their car more sporty.ive yet to drive one, but if mb offers a c350 sedan with 4matic and sport suspension it may very well be the winner next time around. mb puts some serious ""conquest cash incentives"" on their car as of late too.i hope bmw figures out that electric power steering stinks and gives it to me how i like it! like in my e90. "
sweendogy,March 2012, what are the packages on the car again? cost to you- and dealer 
stickguy,March 2012," well, the just introduced 3 series sounds like a winner, so you should be good for a while. who knows (who cares!) about the other players.but, i am thinking that i wish i had the budget to snag my next (and very long term) ride now, with some of the nice 2008/2009 cpos floating around. "
stickguy,March 2012," speaking of packages, i love the way my local dealer does their ltoyotaings (not sure if all bmw dealers are like this). well done ad, and in the detail, it ltoyota all of the packages/options (with original prices even), so you know exactly how each car is equipped. no guessing, no need to worry about some clerk checking the wrong boxes (pretty sure this is somehow automated off of vin) "
flightnurse,March 2012," hey stick all bmw dealers do that, it is nice to see what packages are on the car when they ltoyota them for sale. i have noticed audi does the same thing.fn "
flightnurse,March 2012," nyc, i believe that car manufactures are trying to make the best of the new cafe numbers, and to do so, any and all load is going to be taken off the engine. now until they can get their cafe # up each and every one of them is going to be doing something different. fn "
graphicguy,March 2012, nyc.....too nice . big congrats! 
nyccarguy,March 2012," heres the information you requested:2011 bmw 328xi6-speed steptronic transmissionvalue packagepremium packagenavigationxenon adaptive headlightssplit folding rear seatheated steering wheelmetallic paintmsrp: $44,190sale price: $38,746 ($5444 off msrp)i was never able to calculate the exact dealer invoice due to the fact that nowhere (edmunds, ktoyota, true car, bimmerfest) of the premium package. i probably ended up paying $500 over invoice. "
nyccarguy,March 2012, thanks my friend. i didnt negotiate as well as you could have jedi master. i am ungodly happy with my bmw. i love it! 
fedlawman,March 2012," finally, the pictures! thanks. how about some interior shots?i got my issue of car & driver today and theres a nice comparo of the current crop of ellpss. the new bmw wins, of course, but they mentioned the electric steering more than once. at the end of the article, they basically toyota to go buy a 2011 if you like a more sporting car...i think you made a good move nyc. "
nyccarguy,March 2012," thanks fedlawman! i cannot wait to make it through break in. im so ready to drop the hammer & see what its made of;)ill take some interior shots tomorrow.the difference between the bmw & others in the class is the fact that ive wanted a bmw of my own for a long time now. growing up in the 1980s, i never thought much of the e30s 3 box styling. it wasnt until a close friend graduated college & bought himself a fully loaded e36 325is w/ stick shift & sport package. it stickered for about the same as an e36 bmw at the time. one night we were at a club in buffalo. at about 2am, he was trying to hook up with some 6 blonde girl (my friend is 56""). i told chris i needed to get home to drive back to school (ithaca) the next day. he tossed me his car keys & toyota: ""see you for breakfast.""i remember sliding into the sport seat of that e36 and it just fit me perfectly. i spent the next 2 1/2 hours tearing around the streets of buffalo. i even perfectly rotated the car around corners & steered its tail end with the throttle a few times. at breakfast the next am. ""bradd, you know i dont care, but what were you doing with my car last night?""i tell him how much i love his car & how difficult it will be to hop into my car (1992 beretta gt) & drive back to ithaca. ""why?""chris tells me his sky pager kept going off (they say blowin up now) with messages like: ""chris, slow down!"". ""chris, i think someone stole your car.""from that night in buffalo until last week, ive wanted a bmw of my own. i finally got it! and i love it! "
fedlawman,March 2012," thats awesome! the vanos i-6 is one the sweetest engines of all time. terrific manual transmission too. similar to the m20, but a little silkier iirc. no other engine can match a bmw i-6 for that feeling and sound. enjoy your bmw because when the i-6s are all gone (and they are going), that sweet, smooth wonderfulness will be but a memory...now finish your story. did chris enjoy his evening as much as you did yours? "
graphicguy,March 2012," nyc....you did good on your deal. no worries there.im not one of those people who ""baby"" car during break-in. now, i dont go tearing through the gears, redlining each one, every time im behind the wheel. nor, do i test the limits of abs when i first get a car.but, i also dont make any undo effort to keep below a certain speed/rpm. that philosophy has served me well.wait until you get about 5k miles on it. it seems to really open up then. and mpg improves around that mark, too.have fun!fedlawman....the bmw still uses the i-6, only it has the dual scroll turbo. it also has all the other current engine tricks with vanos (vhondable valve timing) and direct injection. i took mine a step further and had the dealer add the power kit package that boosts hp by 20 and torque by 30+. this is sanctioned by bmw, is warranted the same as the regular bmw warranty, and is mainly an update to the engine management system.i think both 3.0 i-6s (boosted and non-boosted) are way underrated for hp and torque, as both feel a lot stronger than bwms numbers suggest. "
nyccarguy,March 2012, for my man fedlawmans request - 
flightnurse,March 2012," i agree i dont baby mine nor do i red line it either, so far im averaging 21 in mine i only have 3700 miles on it too.i was under the impression that the bmw engine had the double vanos (intake and exhaust.) also if you swap out the intercooler for an aftermarket unit you will increase hp about 15%, this wont void the warranty either. german hp rating, i dont think it is just bmw, but all german brands. for the amount of hp that the german print i have always though they were off their mark. the 7 series with the twin turbo 6 is rated at 315hp and 330lbs, moves this 4600lb car fro 0-60 in 5.8 sec. this is a couple of ticks slower then a 3 series 4 cy turbo. very impressive, when we drove one, i could have sworn it had more hp then what bmw rated it at.fn "
flightnurse,March 2012," nyc, i find it interesting that people think they need to go into a dealership and try and beat the dealer down to a profit margin of -10% on car. i tell people, if you are happy with the deal and if you are happy with the car then you did good. there are monies on all car that not even edmonds know about, it sounds like you are happy and that is a good thing.btw, check out www.truecar.com great website for auto pricing "
nyccarguy,March 2012," i agree. theres always going to be someone who paid less. i couldnt be happier with my car! besides the $5444 i got off the msrp, im getting 2 pmt credits from bmwfs totaling $1000. any car deal (no matter what the salesman says) makes the dealer money. youll never get a car for ""net net."". i love my new bmw! "
graphicguy,March 2012," flightnurse...youre right. the bmw does utilize bmw ""double"" vanos vhondable valve timing.im relatively certain that both the published hp and torque ratings on the i-6 are under rated. "
stickguy,March 2012," i am really jonesing for one of those cp) bmw i found. wonder if my son would care if i skipped paying his senior year college tuition? a diploma is overrated, right? "
flightnurse,March 2012," hey stick make your son pay for his senior year, builds character.. btw, bmw builds a bmw? "
stickguy,March 2012," so i forgot an appostrophe. supposed to have been plural (more than 1 bmw!). and i think he would have to sell a kidney or 2 to buld that much character.but, i am being tortured. just glanced out to the parking lot, and 2 down from my car is a new looking (old style, but not very old) black 3 series. i feel like i am being stalked, or haunted. or just plain teased. "
flightnurse,March 2012," i figured that was the case, however i have been wondering if bmw would build a bmw, this time build based on the sedan not the coupe. give it more hp, more sport just like the bmw...have you looked at carmax regarding your bmw. the zph forum im on finds zph 330s that are for sale. it seems carmax as 3 of them currently for sale, one is a convert in vegas, one is a sedan and other is coupe, low 20s for them, great price, the coupe i saw the ad, it has mid 50s for mileage, and price was in the low 20s. good price for what you are getting. just another avenue for you to look at.fn "
nyccarguy,March 2012, im being an enabler here once again - the car is sweet. 
fedlawman,March 2012," graphicguy - youre right, of course about the bmw, and it is also a really sweet engine. i was just commenting specifically on nycs story about his friends e36. i also agree that it is underrated at 300hp - it definitely feels stronger than that. and yours with the remap upgrade must be a monster. i think they didnt want the bmw to steal bmw sales, but i think it probably does with all that torque. the bmw and bmw have very difference power delivery and personalities, but its the bmw that feels more muscular in the power department - americans tend to prefer that feeling.nyc - thanks for the inside shots. your car is loaded and looks really nice. some people dont like wood trim, but i think it looks really classy. very nice car! "
graphicguy,March 2012," stick.....you got your son most of the way. he can pick up the light work on the last year of his tuition..... :p besides, as nyc pointed out, there are some deals to be had on 11 3 series right now. gotta strike while the irons hot! btw.....im getting between 21 mpg and 22 mpg in town, and just broke 30 mpg in a mix of 90% highway and 10% honda driving. i run straightly costco premium in it.im happy with that. "
nyccarguy,March 2012," thanks so much! im not a huge wood trim fan either, but love it and everything about my new 3. "
stickguy,March 2012, the one at my office (i stopped to look on my way out) was basically your car in black (over tan). a bmw x-drive. not sure of the navi 9forgot to look). very nice looking.most likely a 2011 since the inspection sticker was issued 10/11. 
sweendogy,March 2012, while i think the 328xi is a great car- wonder what a leftover infiniti with the same options would be- plus you get an extra 100plus hp. since 90 plus % of 328x car are auto anyway- i would argue you can get a better car for less. plus despite what others believe the infiniti is very low maintenance - i know bc ive spent under 500 bux in 4 years. i know bmw will throw in an oil change or 2 but if you consider the numbers its still a no- brainier. sorry to ruin the love fest- and if you dont believe me read consumer reports - the category is entry level - price matters 
graphicguy,March 2012," flightnurse....not that it means all that much, but in my younger years a buddy and i had a ragged out ford track only car. we used to run it at the local 1/4 mile track.i dont track anymore. but, am always curious about the speed of my personal ride. very unofficial, and done with a passenger holding a digi watch, but i put up a 0-60 in the low 5s in my bmw. that was before the power package install. im certain it will it high 4s 0-60 now.not too shatoyotay for an automatic, 6 cyl. "
flightnurse,March 2012, sweeny only way to find out is go buy one and let us know. 
flightnurse,March 2012," graphic it appears most gear-heads had a ford at one time. im no different,had a nice 65 and 70 boss 302. i miss the boss...im sure you could get in the mid 4s with the car with a little work, there are many aftermarket companies that have goodies for your car, just depends on how deep your pockets are, really. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsotgmhhlqgfed, im sure the guys who buy a m car new, really dont car that with less money a lesser bmw can beat it...fn "
fedlawman,March 2012," true. i saw an m on the road yesterday. i couldnt take my eyes off it. ive seen them plenty, but those huge rear wheels and quad pipes sticking out the back give it a real menacing look. surprisingly different from the bmw, which should look very similar yet somehow looks more elegant than menacing with the same body. although i would most definitely be happy with a bmw, i would pay more for the m - its more my style. if im not bouncing off the rev limiter at 8000 rpm, i might as well be driving my wifes volvo.  "
flightnurse,March 2012," i have to agree, ltoyotaening to the v8 at 8k has a nice sound to it, but then again having a plain jane bmw keep the police away too. "
mvs1,April 2012," student loans are cheap money and this would build character. my parents did the very same, minimal monies from them and the rest on me and/or my employer at the time....made me appreciate what ive worked for now. i do feel for the new graduates that come in with $200k plus student loans hanging over their heads nowadays "
graphicguy,April 2012," flightnurse....yeah....we saw a lot of ford at the track.....cameros, too ours was a poor excuse for a ford. the body was a mess. we took out every and any thing that had weight to it. we got to the point where the body looked like aluminum foil on the inside.we spent most of our effort with the 302, performance heads, exhaust, etc. we trailered it to the track and trailered it home. i wish i still had the money i put into that heap. but, it was fast. and, we had an awfully good time messing with it over the years.it sat in my buddys back yard for a few years. finally, his wife told him he either had to use it, or lose it. we sold the drivetrain complete. but, we parted out the rest of what was left of it. i think there are actually two boxes of parts left of it still sitting in his garage.went to that same track 2-3 years ago just to watch. in addition to cameros, firebirds and ford, we saw a lot of subarus, evos, a few of those recent half hearted gm attempts to revive the dead again pontiac pontiacs.the subarus and evos should stick to motor cross. we saw more than one of each blow up on the track. the fast and furious crowd think that putting a nos system in them is all it takes. you could tell when they injected them....theyd get a 50 yard burst, a big ""pow"" and then lots of smoke and limping away. "
nyccarguy,April 2012," always interesting to get another perspective on how my bmw drives, especially from the person who didnt want me to get rid of her beloved acura (she got the engagement ring & the big wedding). i brought my sons (5 1/2 & 3) to work with me on saturday. we took the honda. this left my wife home with our 4 month old daughter & my bmw. we were on our way to a friends saturday night & i asked her: ""so whatd you think of my car?""she tells me: ""its fast. very fast. i looked down a few times & was shocked to be going 90.""so i ask her: ""so you like it then?""she replies: ""well the navigation in the acura was easier to use.""she doesnt want to admit im right! i love her anyway! "
stickguy,April 2012," i still get a laugh out of the people that try to make a na 328 out to be some kind of slug that can barely get out of its own way. unless you are out on a track (and i mean a real track, not auto-x) it is still (even an awd slushbox) scary fast, when you are talking about driving in the real world.going back a few years, my (sons) 2000 acura tl is also a ticket magnet. that car just loves to cruise fast. 75 seems to be its natural loafing sweet spot, and if you dont pay a lot of attention it will creep right up to 90 without noticing it.was like that since new hondaing to my stoyotaer (the original owner) and will still do it now with 162k on the clock. good thing my son is religious about using cc coming down from the north country (there is a whole lotta nothing on i81 and the ne extension of the pa turnpike, and you could easily cruise at 100) "
flightnurse,April 2012," i dont want to hijack this tread, but yeah, those were the days.. btw, the first gen eclipes if set up right were very fast... "
sweendogy,April 2012," from a standstill to 60 in 6.5, in auto- fast sure but new wrangler does the same sprint to 60 in 6.7- and i would say thats ""scary fast"" given the fact its a tin box on stilts. lets remember the car starts at 37k without options - again nice car but its not end all be all- certainly not in automatic form and certainly not for the inflated msrp. i would equate this car to kentucky basketball always a good team, wins the championship a lot - but doesnt play by the rules- entry level sedan should not cost this much new. "
graphicguy,April 2012," sween....gotta say buddy, youve made some pretty far fetched comparisons in this thread, but dragging the jeep into this is about as far out there as you can possibly get. im thinking you might want to give it a rest for a while to gather some perspective before venturing into the waters were swimming in this thread. "
sweendogy,April 2012," buddy i really took a deep dive and compaired the jeep to a bmw, buddy- what i did say that that jeep is almost as fast as the bmw to 60, and its scary fast given the structure. (pretty clear where i was going with this) sure it does not belong here, but on the thread you speak of- we have all talked bmw, porsche, boss 302s - all within the last month.. if you dont like what i wrote fine but you have added nothing but an insult, buddy.waters warm and i love to swim.  "
nyccarguy,April 2012," sweendogy - ill agree with you that price absolutely matters in this and any category. everybodys got a price ceiling, whether its a dollar amount or a payment amount whether you are talking honda vs. ford, this current crop of ellps, the 5, e, audi group, and even the 7, s, audi models.price drove my purchase. i had equity in my acura, bmw offered generous discounts and incentives, so i got a car ive been dreaming about since the late 1990s.i love the way the infiniti drives. theres something to be toyota for the fact that the car has an extra almost 100 horsepower. it is a rocket. its power is intoxicating. it is faster than my 328xi for sure. so you could say the infiniti offers a faster car for the same or for less money. i dont personally think faster equates to better.car in this class arent all about 0 - 60 mph times. there is so much more to the equation that i know you know, otherwise you wouldnt be driving a g. youd be driving a 5.0 ford or chevrolet ss. "
nyccarguy,April 2012," when i drive car, one thing i judge them by is their toyotaable driving speed or ""natural loafing sweet spot"" as you so nicely put it. hondaing to me, it is the driving speed at which the car ""feels"" just right driving at. not full throttle, wheres the fire, my wifes water just broke, and her contractions are 2 minutes apart driving.my honda feels perfect at 75, even though the tach needle is over 3k. anything over that and i feel im driving the honda ""fast,""my former acura felt just right at 80. which seems logical given that it is heavier than my honda, has more sound deadening material, and an actual overdriven 5th gear.ive had the bmw up at 90 for a few brief moments and the car was as you and my wife have pointed out is ""scary fast."" the car is just inceredibly planted at speed. "
stickguy,April 2012," price is big to me. an unfortunate side effect of being poor! if i only figured out 20 years ago how much i could have saved getting 2 puppies instead of having kids...anyway, that is why i have fully embraced the mantra: depreciation is your friend! assuming you arent the first buyer. the couple of cpo bmw models i found last week (a 2008 and a 2009) were going to cost about what a load up ford would, or a mid-level toyota. iow, affordable, and a very realtoyotaic alternative to brand new.though i still want to see a dodge dodge in person! "
nyccarguy,April 2012," stickguy - you dont want a dodge dodge. i dont care how much of a guised up alfa romeo it is. it happens to look great in the pics ive seen. its not a bmw.just a personal note about those 08 & 09 cpo bmw (plural). some of the 09s came with these 16"" wheels standard. they look small on the e90 imho.my mom had an 08 328xi for 3 years & almost 60k miles. not only was it a great car to drive, but absolutely bulletproof. "
kdshapiro,April 2012, there is a refinement in the bmw not present in the g. only you can decide if that is worth it to you.@nyccarguy - congrats. it is gorgeous. makes me really miss by ex-bmw. my g cannot match the smoothness of my ex-bmw. hp aint everything. 
sweendogy,April 2012," agree the refinement is something for sure. im sure the new bmw 3 for 2012 should help the dated interior and nav setup, as others have pointed out. audi continues to excel at interiors and is the standard for the class for such. the 25% or more msrp difference is hard to ignore for the 335 vs infiniti- (please dont argue with me - ive priced them option for option) and even the msrp for the 328 balloons to 50k. i think nyc did a great job getting the deal on a great car- and i wish him well and i hope to see him on the merritt one day. my argument has never been the g as a better car- but a better value for a lot of the same things the bmw does. the g or acura might never be the top pick for car and driver mag, or the ""true driver""- but in consumer reports they have constoyotaently ranked better. an unbiased news rag with no advertising support- i think the true driver, a person who wants the true sport and performance is going to get the 335 or 328 - with sport and stick. other then that set up these car in this class are very close regardless of price. - "
flightnurse,April 2012," there is a difference between comparing two car and mentioning car. no were are you going to find anyone comparing a ford (boss 302) to a bmw. now i would love to add the chryslerc to the ltoyota, after having one for 8 days i have to say for the price you get a lot for your money. when the 8 spd auto goes into the car for my 2013 this will be a car that will give infiniti and bmw a run for their money... "
sweendogy,April 2012, i dont understand the first paragraph - but agree the chryster has made major strides in a short period. nice job flight - your back 
flightnurse,April 2012," hey stick i agree with you to a point regarding depreciation. price is a relative thing, if i couldnt afford a new bmw, yes, i would go for a cpo bmw, but i keep my car longer then most, currently i have no plans on selling my 05. if i had to sell one of my bmw the 2011 is a goner. my partner hasnt made up is mind what car he wants, he was edging towards a bmw, i was sort of pushing towards a 740i (same engine with 15+ more hp.) but he started looking at used audi he is looking at price (trying to save some money.) so who knows what we will buy, but for him price is playing a factor. "
flightnurse,April 2012," sweeny the reason why you dont understand the first paragraph is simple, it was directed at you comparing a jeep to a bmw... with the 8 spd coming to 300c, the might g will have major competition in the best bang for the buck. for under 40k the 300c will be a major player. just as long as chrysler doesnt progdodge the 300c to go into ""eco"" mode so quickly even bmw will have to watch out. "
sweendogy,April 2012," and your back to the defensive norm- if you follow the posts my comment again was for stick guy saying the 328xi autonwas scary fast in the real world- and i responded with saying the jeep was almost as fast - but its a jeep, thats the point -fun odd fsct- jeep and the c300 share the same parent - please give us updates on when to expect the 8speed auto becomes available. "
nyccarguy,April 2012, kdshapiro - thanks my man! i just love the car and cannot say enough good things about it. havent heard from you in a while & glad you are still here!btw men - i turned 36 today! 
m6user,April 2012," gee, didnt know chrylser was a luxury brand. never see it mentioned in the rags as such. since the chrysler is the ""entry-level"" chrysler and can have the same engine as the 300, i guess one could make an argument that the 200 should be part of this discussion. wait, isnt that the remake of the acclaimed chrysler? that will never do.it seems like anytime someone drives a car with leather, some power and decent driving attributes they think its ellps. use some discretion folks. the 8spd is offered in the dodge. again, leather, decent handling, 8spd tranny and good power from a v6. should it also be ellps?personally, i think there is more to being a luxury brand than nice leather. including driving experience, styling that holds up over time, amenities, cutting edge tech, customer service, warranty, dealer experience and overall quality of components. i dont think chrysler is there yet....maybe a couple of pieces but not the whole pie. "
stickguy,April 2012," happy birthday. keep enjoying that early present.i was 36 once. a long time ago. a real long time.i have a birthday in a few weeks, but it is much more renowned than 36 (as a milestone!) "
flightnurse,April 2012," i love alfas, i had a gtv-6 for a short period, the music the engine made was so ferrari like however, like all italian car, if they are not kept up as far as service they are a nightmare to keep running. however, i would have to assume that the modern day alfas are not of the old, much more derivable and much less a problem. im for once waiting to see what the new dodge will look like in person and drive.. hoping that national will get them as rentals i would have to give it a try. "
flightnurse,April 2012," i am not the one who continues to write comments about how wonderful the g is over the 3 series. in fact your g is very dated compared to the 3 series. your comment about dated interior and nav in the new my 2012 shows you do not have first hand knowledge of the car. go buy a new infiniti then talk about how wonderful it is, stop reading the mags and coming off as an expert. "
kdshapiro,April 2012, nyc - thx. life takes over. happy birthday to you. this particular discussion is probably the best on the interwebs. now stay out of the cops radar.  
kdshapiro,April 2012," i really cant agree with your post. bmw makes the better sports sedan and has great tech. and while the g is certainly due for a refresh, it is a great car in its own right.the nav is very good, tech in the car is good. its an acceleration monster and really hugs the road. the wood trim gives the interior a very classy look. cup holders stink, but i love the electric telescoping steering wheel. highway mileage is decent, trunk is roomy. i love that hids are standard. and i have all the goodies for a measly 45k. bt acuration is awesome, and the bose is good. non sport seat are toyotaable.so while i love bmw, the infiniti is not an also-ran and in almost every comparo, comes in second for good reason. i tested out the awd system during that freak october storm and i was impressed.as i started out this post, the g is a fine car in its own right. "
flightnurse,April 2012," fact, i never talked about the chrysler, all of my comments have been regarding the 300c.fact, the only chrysler car not to have the 8 spd for my 2012 is the v8 car, whether they are dodge or chrysler, that will change for my2013 when all chrysler car will get the new 8 spd auto.fact, chrysler was the luxury division, granted they suffered in the past, but i can state things have gotten better, and yes, they should be in the ellps. the feel of the leather, switches, steering, handling and the closing of the doors have a great feel to them, if you havent driven one then it is hard to make comments about the car. "
flightnurse,April 2012," sweeny wrote, "" fun odd fsct- jeep and the c300 share the same parent - please give us updates on when to expect the 8speed auto becomes available.""this makes no sense, the nissan nissan and infiniti infiniti are from the same parent too, so when we can expect the nissan to get a v6 option? "
kdshapiro,April 2012, upscale vs luxury. my local chrysler dealership is not in the same league as my local lexus dealership.do all manufacturers who put leather seat in their vehicles belong in this discussion? 
graphicguy,April 2012," kd....if chrysler slapped an imperial badge on the 300 would that make it a worthy candidate for this discussion? not disagreeing with you, only that, at the very least, ive heard chrysler execs state that the 300 is their luxury offering.flightnurse and nyc....im with you on the 0-60 thing. if that was the end all to beat all, then this discussion would only be about ford gts/boss/kc, chevrolet sss, dodge/dodge rts and vettes.then again, as we all know, nothing really competes with a g series, regardless of the padodgeeter you use......well, except maybe a jeep. "
sweendogy,April 2012," graph and flight- please put the bmw blinders away-- i think everyone here can agree the bmw is the best in class car-- but if you include price its got some serious competition-- and since this is ellps you have(i think ive toyota this now 25times) to include price- 0-60 time and hp should be included as well as they are very important to the overall package-- as ive mentioned bmw has many advantages - but price is not one of them- 25% more for a car is a huge chunk to pay for a similar car-- is the premium worth it, thats the question- and in my eyes and others that are owners of lexus is, infiniti, tl - its not. again if you equip a 328xi maxed out its 50k-- a 335xi gets you over 55k- others top out at 42-45k-- huge diff and need to be factored in. "
flightnurse,April 2012," kd, then the acura shouldnt be here either since its an honda made fancy. or in jdm the g is far from a luxury car. once again, have driven the new chryslerc? i think i know the answer already. i dont think you have, so why are saying that the 300c shouldnt be here if you have no first hand knowledge of the current 300c? "
stickguy,April 2012," i thought the concept was more about the car, but it is sounding now like the dealership is a big part of it? but to me, that is far down the ltoyota. i dont expect to spend any time there anyway (after buying it!). so if they have a clean, drive in, well organized service area, good to go! though i guess a loaner car would be nice, but again, how much do you want to pay for that?as to the car themselves, i would discard the 300c since it is a fs barge. and if you are including that (maybe even if not), why isnt the hyundai hyundai included? simply because you have to go to the hyundai dealer to get one? "
kdshapiro,April 2012," i think the acura is the classic definition of an entry level sedan within a lineup of models. while it may not have the cache, i dont see why its not an ellps. acura markets it as a sporty vehicle.no, i havent driven the 300, but what should be litmus test for including an ellps in this category. it has to be more than leather seat.  "
m6user,April 2012," 1. i never toyota you mentioned the 200. i simply stated if you want to include the 300c, then logically the 200 should also be included as that is the ""entry-level"" offering from your so called luxury car division....chrysler.2. i realize the 8spd is only offered on the v6 now. that is why i mentioned that the 200 can have the same engine as the 300, the v6. please read posts more carefully.if marketing jargon is the criteria for inclusion then many manufacturers would be discussed here. one doesnt have to drive every car made to know that certain manufacturers and certain car shouldnt be included here. there are many ways to determine through magazines, auto shows, dealer showrooms, etc. and the test drive is just one factor(albeit a major factor). there are many aspects as to what makes a luxury car and carmaker and, yes, it does include the dealer experience. go to your local chysler/dodge dealer and see how it compares to a bmw or lexus dealer and honestly report which ones feel like a luxury carmaker and which one doesnt.however, everything i say is based on the premise that the car discussed here are supposed to be from what is commonly as a luxury carmaker. if that is wrong and it just depends on any one members perception of what a luxury car is without regard to brand, size, price than i will stand corrected. "
sweendogy,April 2012, good post- i especially agree that he should read the posts more carefully. 
nyccarguy,April 2012," just to elaborate on pricing a little bit. if bmw didnt have this crazy factory backed lease progdodge + $2500 rebate + making the 1st 2 payments, im still driving the acura. the bmw is expensive. my 328xi had an msrp of just over $44,000. that also includes a whole heap of standard features and ""no cost options"" bmw put in the car because it was the end of the e90s run. for comparison, my moms (former) 2008 328xi had less equipment than my 2011 328xi yet had an msrp of over $46,000.when my lease is up, im going to have to make a decision. im obviously going to drive an f30 (4 cyl 3 series), but i think with similar equipment to my 2011 will be priced out of my league. the is is going to be all new. the infiniti is going to be all new. mb might get some sense knocked into it and offer the c350 with 4matic.i might not like any of these and want to buy my 2011 back from bmw or buy a similar 2011 328xi cpo with 25,000 or 30,000 miles (instead of the 50k mine will have). "
sweendogy,April 2012, yeah man- i know and rooted for you to get a great deal on the search and you did. for the price you paid i think throws my cost agrument out the window- its a great deal on a well equipped car. like you pointed out most are not going to get such a deal- i would bet the 2012 are going close to ltoyota because of the new body. landscape should change a bit and its going to be interesting to see what happens with this new caddy as well- looks like a power player on paper. 
nyccarguy,April 2012," while i dont think other car mentioned here should be officially added to the ltoyota here, there is no shame in discussing them. weve got a pretty steady following of regulars here and everyones opinion is weighted equally. i know if flightnurse says the 300c is a nice driving car, hes not just talking about the fact that it has leather seat.if when my lease is up, i can get into a infiniti with 100 more horsepower for $100 a month less or $50 a month less on a lease, then id most certainly go for it. if mb offers up the serious ""conquest cash"" that they did last year for the c - class and i can drive one for less than my current 328xi, ill drive a mercedes (c350 4matic).in 30 months, i might not exclusively shop this ellps class either. i might dig the x1 or a cpo x3 with the n55... who knows.for now i love my bmw 328xi! "
sweendogy,April 2012," i agree that the 300c and the c300 should be mentioned, yes i agree with flight, even when he asks for my age but doesnt respond why he needs it,dont be shocked. im a firm believer that dealership experience means little certainly given the car we talk about here - they should be low maintence and most are- sure some try to bait you with free maintence progdodges for free wipers and oil changes but most of these car should not see the dealerships for more then a couple of oil changes for the first few years. i think the most important thing you can get from a dealer is a good deal on initial price. flight has a point we should look further and this 300c could be a bmw competitor in the future- a value leader as he once toyota even thou its classified as full size and car to the right are midsize at best. i am not a firm believer that an 8 speed transmission means anything at all but the guy has his performance views and i guess a strong 8 speed is one of them. i think his statement has more value then others talking about bmw or porsches that are clearly out off the category all together. "
kdshapiro,April 2012," lets not forget that edmunds is very topic oriented, am im not being the forum police here. anybody is certainly free to go to the news and views board and create the thread of their choice to discuss whatever is related to the auto world.dont forget all of these car have some competition on almost every level and some marquees, e.g. hyundai produces the hyundai and hyundai, which some may say are luxury car, but the dealerships dont pass the litmus test of a luxury dealership. neither do chrysler dealerships. especially if one uses lexus as the benchmark.maybe this particular thread has outlived its usefulness due to the changed landscape of the auto world. "
graphicguy,April 2012," kd....outlived its usefulness? not so certain about that. the names may have indeed changed. but, the market segment is still alive and vibrant (luxury sport sedan/coupes).nyc....bmw does indeed discount their car pretty heavily....especially with lease subsidies. i think i got $7k+ off on mine (including a hefty $2,500 rebate). you got almost as much off with the addition of favorable money factors and residuals.this is not dtoyotaressed merchandise. they are ""best in class"" vehicles. that blunts things as far as making that financial commitment.that toyota, if i was staring at a ~$50k 12 bmw, with a 4 cyl, with little to no discount, id be moving down the road into something else, for certain. ive tried to warm up to mercedes a few times, both c and e class. i can not do it. for the life of me, i cant see the appeal....especially for the price. they dont do one thing thats better than the competition.to add insult to injury, you can get a chryslerc, which has a honkin hemi, that rides and handles about the same as an e class with a 6 cyl. and, it has better tech features. so, maybe the 300 does belong here. "
wireless,April 2012," ""ive tried to warm up to mercedes a few times, both c and e class. i can not do it. for the life of me, i cant see the appeal....especially for the price. they dont do one thing thats better than the competition.""i bought a 12 c350 in november. drove other ellpss. the mercedes was the clear winner. im a car enthusiast for many decades, read c&d, and know bmw reputation. was quite surprised how much i didnt like the bmw. interior was bad, very bad, looks the same for the past 10 years. driving was nothing special, the salesman encouraged us to drive very quickly around his route which included a traffic circle as well as interstate. just didnt do it for us. the mb handled much better and rode better and was better in every regard. we would have bought an audi well before a bmw. its really personal preference. we got the c350 for $43k out the door with 18s, keyless go, no nav. most features are standard on the 350 such as upgraded sound system. i do like the way bmw look. there are way too many on the road now - i see more of them than honda. the interior and driving toyotamics - not so much. "
nyccarguy,April 2012," hello wireless! welcome to the bmw 3 series rules the universe, i mean entry level luxury performance sedan board. congrats on your c350. im glad you are enjoying it. it is a beautiful car. its also got a ton of standard features. so much so that i dont know why anybody would consider a ""loaded up"" c250 because it gets to the same sticker price very easily.just curious as to where you live. in many of our necks of the woods here, we like to have our ellps fitted with some sort of awd system. mb only offers the c300 w/ 4matic awd. which 3 series did you drive? did you drive the c250 & c350?thanks for sharing about your c350. "
andres3,April 2012, been seeing and earning a lot of black dots lately. 
qbrozen,April 2012, what does that mean? is that a cr thing? 
dino001,April 2012," yes, full black dot is ""significantly below average"" in a given category (they have aroun 15) for a used car of a given year. "
sweendogy,April 2012," lesson learned, pay heavy premium get the free maintence progdodge for 4 years, enjoy the ultimate driving machine, but trade it back in before warrantee is up or it will be the ultimate repair bill. "
qbrozen,April 2012, so what do they show for an 08 335/135?  
kdshapiro,April 2012, bmw sells a lot of car. maybe their target market doesnt read cr.  
wireless,April 2012," yeah i know what you mean about a loaded up c250 - they have those in the dealership for just shy of $50k. beautiful car if you wanted loaded up everything and i think the gas mileage is a little better. personally i wouldnt mind the smaller engine as much as the turbo. just dont trust the long-term reliability of turbos. have heard bad things about the audi and volkswagens (""cripplingly expensive to repair""). my wife toyota get a powerful engine and, man, who could argue with that? i live in nc so no need for awd. i heard the c350 awd drive will be out soon though. getting ready to leave on an 8-hour trip in a few minutes... in the toyota michevroletn argggggggg!!! "
qbrozen,April 2012, i only know i dont.  
graphicguy,April 2012," kd....never been a cr fan. their flaw is they tell their readership what their reliability should be, and they respond hondaingly. thats why honda have been at the top of their ltoyota for so long. on top of that, they only grudgingly took lexus/toyota off of their ""recommended"" ltoyota when they were going through the unintended acceleration fiasco. even though toyota was exonerated, cr had no reason to pull them from the recommended ltoyota, other than public opinion.so, if a bmw is thought to be problematic, regardless of the facts, cr rates them as such. perception is reality is crs world.i agree with you. i doubt cr sells many subscriptions into the bmw market.for decades, they put different values on car than those of us in here do. in crs world, everyone should be driving a toyota, toyota, honda or an honda.i havent read their mag in 15 years. when i did read their rag, i didnt find one thing about their ratings and opinions i agreed with. i just hear people in these sorts of threads talk about them. "
dino001,April 2012," even though toyota was exonerated, cr had no reason to pull them from the recommended ltoyota, other than public opiniontoo much conspiracy theory, imho. it is actually much simpler. besides acceleration fiasco, toyota was actually going through a quality dip during mid-to-late 00. it was related to their goal of being no. 1 in sales, catching a moderate case of gmnitis, absorbing too many new suppliers too quickly and attempting too aggressive pricing cuts to meet the points (and sales quotas). the acceleration thing was just the apex of the process. regardless whether the issue was real or imaginary (pedal was real and they kicking and screaming admitted it, electronics may have been imaginary) , cr simply noticed what people did - their new spanking camries and lexus (lexi?) were not as reliable as the previous ones. they had no choice, but take them off that ""automatic recommendation"" ltoyota. btw automatic recommendation really meant that if a new model tested well enough to get positive review, they would not wait for the reliability data to recommend it, as htoyotaory of previous models had a constoyotaent track record of good reliability. toyota simply lost that streak. there are plenty of models that have good reliability, but are not recommended due to lower score in tests and vice nissan - good score, but reliability below average, or ""new/no data"". it is all constoyotaent. one can dispute their ratings (they tend to ford things that enthusiasts simply dont care about and other items that are very important to the enthusiasts get low weight in their score), also their reliability survey method can sometimes be disputed, as well. i just dont exactly believe in conspiracy that the results are predetermined. bmw bmw is usually ""in or out"", depending on the year, point in the cycle. they usually get top ratings in their category (so even cr likes them as ellps), but the recommendation is occasionally withheld, when the survey data shows constoyotaent issues with significant repairs, regardless whether paid by the owner, or in warranty. btw, honda is going through similar crtoyota today as toyota did in late 00. it is not related to reliability, but to overall design/quality feel. the new honda is such a flop (not in real terms, vs. expectations and competition progress) that honda decided to accelerate the refreshing cycle. "
dino001,April 2012," for decades, they put different values on car than those of us in here do. in crs world, everyone should be driving a toyota, toyota, honda or an hondathat is not entirely accurate. they place vehicles in different categories. it just so happens that small and midsize sedan are most known and followed by people, hence toyota or toyota. they have other categories, too and occasionally test them. bmw bmw constoyotaently wins its own class (sporty upscale sedan) in terms of points, it even sometimes gets recommendations, which it can later lose due to reliability data. same often happens to volkswagen - it very often is on top of the ratings, but it does not get recommended due to reliability. then toyota/honda step in, as being half-notch below, but with better record. they do not say ""you should buy ..., period"". they say, ""if you want a familly sedan below $30k, you should buy..."". big difference.in other words, their criteria and values are not as different as yours, but they use a two-stage evaluation process. step one is the car merrits, as what pertains to its category. you score above certain threshold, you become a candidate. step two is reliability data. it just so happens that those darlings of ours also happen to be more prone to failures than those more hum-drum offerings of others. "
flightnurse,April 2012," sweeny to set record straight in a posting that was pulled by the host, i responded why i asked your age. "
m6user,April 2012," i havent read their mag in 15 years.yeah, im going to take your perception as reality. got any proof that people filling out their surveys are just lambs led to slaughter and who cant seperate fantasy from reality? gimme a break. "
Kirstie_H,April 2012," cr isnt for enthusiasts. bmw drivers tend to be enthusiasts; therefore, cr isnt for bmw shoppers. i doubt anyone wondering whether they should or shouldnt get a bmw bothers consulting cr.its more for items where there isnt a wide array of difference in performance and options - say, toasters. toasters have one job - to turn bread that isnt toast into toasted bread. some may do it a bit faster or more evenly, and may last longer, but thats about all there is to rate. "
flightnurse,April 2012," kd interesting point, however, hyundai has an interesting approach when it comes to the hyundai. if you want to look at one and are serious, the hyundai dealer will bring the car to you whether it is at home or the office, so you dont have to walk into a dealership. if and when it comes to service, hyundai will come and pick up the car from you, with a loaner car. hyundai knows that if they want to be taken seriously they have to play different. i also like the fact that the hyundai owners manual are on a ipad that comes with the car. again, thinking outside the box.i believe the hyundai is a luxury car, for hyundai. for the size, equipment and, price they have a great product. give then another year or two and i truly believe they will be a big player in the luxury car market. people laughed at acrua, lexus and infiniti when they started and today, we have people who do nothing but praise them like they are gods. "
ivan_99,April 2012," i dont think there is any proof that people are filling out cr surveys as lambs...but there is no proof they are not.i think cr and even jd powers is about as good as we can get trying to determine reliability.which isnt very good...lets say you have two car mb e class and kia rio. i would suspect that if both experience 5 minor problem that mr e class would note every single one. there is an expectation that once you spend a certain amount that everything should be working correctly (i also subscribe to this theory). the rio guy didnt see the, fictional, power window switch not working as a problem...because hey...it didnt leave me stranded...and they fixed it under warranty.i would also suspect that once you start adding in ""free"" maintenance it skews the results.then i have my couch theory that relates to demographics. give the same couch to college dudes and grandma. after 3 years which couch is more ""reliable"". what if grandmas really liked a particular couch (wonder why buick is so high on jd powers...). or why, for some reason, the lexus gs and is had worse than their ""normal"" reliability rating; answer: because they sell those to people like me (drive it like you stole it).speaking of jd powers. a while ago i compared the long term reliability from two separate periods. conclusion: a new audi is as reliable as a toyota from 5 years ago...the new toyota is even more reliable...but if 5 years ago you were ""happy"" with the number of problem per 100 vehicles...you could justify a new audi  "
m6user,April 2012," interesting point of view. how would you explain that different brands and models within change in the cr results from model year to model year? wouldnt the people owning them have the same attributes and be reporting similarly. a mb owner wouldnt suddenly become complacent about the 5 problem and the kia owner wouldnt suddenly become more critical. probably no real way of ever determining and it probably works on a curve anyway. oh well, this discussion has strayed way off topic and im sure people want to move on. "
dino001,April 2012," a mb owner wouldnt suddenly become complacent about the 5 problem and the kia owner wouldnt suddenly become more criticalactually, they potentially could, very much so. it is a game of expectations. doesnt mean this is the only vhondable, but it is important one, often not taken into account. i would add, i dont care much for jp powers methodology. there were several times, when i read results of their surveys vs. what i knew about the car, it became evident to me there is a lot pretending there. case in point - subaru subaru. since 2005, it had three dtoyotainct levels of trim with totally different engine performance. while standard four cylinder is so-so, the gt trim turbo is a beast, one of the fastest in the group. yet, jp powers would allow you to choose specifically ""gt"" trim and would still assign lower than average acceleration to it. i suspect, the surveys were not properly sorted, there was probably not enough data for separate gt trim, but jp powers would not admit that - theyd rather give you garbage data based on averaged low-end trim line and pretend it also pertained to the higher one. once i discovered that, it became clear to me these guys know much less than they are pretending to do. not to mention their choices for categories, like ""harsh ride"" somehow becomes part of a ""quality"" in their ""initial"" or ""long term"" quality studies. pure ignorance taken to extreme. "
cdnpinhead,April 2012," with cr survey methodology is that its a self-selected cohort. the people who take the time to fill out the multi-page survey (imho) are either really upset or extremely pleased with their vehicle, or worse yet, have an axe of some sort to grind (pious drivers, anyone?). run-of-the-mill people who have better things to do with their time arent included.its anythiing but a stattoyotaically-valid survey, but no one seems to care, and here we are.plus which, a flaw that causes the car to stop running isnt differentiated from one thats an inconvenience or a minor annoyance in a system that 99% continues to function. "
flightnurse,April 2012," wireless i havent read many personal reviews of the current c class from owners, i like the coupe though but the price i cant warm up to. i was a big mercedes fan many years ago however, i have a secret desire for a e55 wagon. the design of the current mercedes doesnt do it for me, however it is typical german in its design, something that bmw and audi are not. we all have our likes and dislikes, this is what makes the world go around.fn "
kdshapiro,April 2012," lexus, acura and infiniti set the bar in terms of dealerships. there is a toyota and lexus dealership in my neck of the woods, right next to one another. i cannot image the toyota dealer selling an ls 460 out of its showroom, which is akin to hyundai selling the hyundai next to an hyundai.not that that is bad. but american buyers, imo, expect the dealers to walk the walk and talk the talk when it comes to luxury vehicles.im not sure i would be happy to have these service guys drive my car back and forth the dealership. my ex-bmw dealer had that option, but i decided not to avail myself of that particular service. "
sweendogy,April 2012," ""cr isnt for enthusiasts"" - bold statement - i subscribe to cr and own a car in this class- and i shopped bmw, and continue to cross shop the class. i take what they say along with what other mags have to say as a good barometer for what my next purchase should be- its not set in stone but its a guide- they are not a ""rag"" and have no support other then subscribers so i take what they say seriously - unlike other mags that are tied to certain product lines.(not directed at host) i love when people argue about what consumers are saying about the bmw - mind you these are people who bought (or leased) a car and are just posting an opinion so other consumers know what to expect. toyota argument - nice try but really? "
sweendogy,April 2012, it must of been a real kick to the shins - rock on 
flightnurse,April 2012," kd from what i have read the person who comes and picks up the car is a concierge type person, so in theory one would never have to step into a dealership at all. "
stickguy,April 2012," now that sounds like my kind of semi-retirement job!much better than working the front door at walmart.actually, all the honda van drivers at my honda dealer are retired gents that do it for pocket money (or to get away from their wife!) "
nyccarguy,April 2012," hyundai for doing what lexus did way back in the day. i can see how the hyundai works, although i dont see any in my neck of the woods because they do not offer awd (awd is expected here in the northeast). im not sure who the target market for the eqqus is. my parents are 66 & 64. they both drive car that cost what an eqqus costs (2011 cayenne v6 & 2011 chevrolet ltz). i can tell you that theres no way either of them is setting foot in a hyundai dealership. they also tend to like the firm ride of a german car. "
flightnurse,April 2012," once again this is why we have choices, for me i dont care about the dealership experience, as long as i can drop off my car, and get out in a reasonable amount of time im happy. now i like the idea on not setting foot in a dealership as all to buy and get my car service sounds great. i think the buying process is horrible, but bmw, mb, audi, lexus, acrua, infiniti have it right, have a nice clean dealership with a very relax atmosphere it the correct way to go.

fedlawman,April 2012," thanks nyc!1995 c4. one owner local car.funny, it just occurred to me - i got both the 911 and the 318ic for about the cost of a base bmw...  "
nyccarguy,April 2012," those 95s are what made me fall in love with the 911. i didnt particularly care for the styling before that. i thought they looked like a squashed bug. i was a 944/928/968 fan. ever since i first laid eyes on a 95 911, i immediately added it to my ltoyota of dream car! how many miles are on your c4? howd you find it? why was this guy selling it?im starting to dip into my bmw performance potential. first and foremost im so impressed with how well the chassis is balanced. it pours itself around curves. the entire car is very fluid. i used to say that id only want a rwd 3 series with a sport pkg & frowned upon bmw for only offering a cosmetic sport package with awd. not anymore. im so happy with how well my 328xi drives. i dont feel the need for anything sharper & a bit lighter (sport pkg & rwd). i dont feel the need or want for anymore power.when i drive a car, i always try to pick a theme song for it. something that suits the car perfectly. my honda theme is ""sunshine of your love"" by cream.for my 328xi, since im leasing it and have to give it back in 2 1/2 years, i picked ""stay with me"" by faces. ""yeah ill pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne, just dont be here in the morning when i wake up."" "

flightnurse,April 2012," nyc, growing up in socal porsches were everywhere, there was a mix of 911s and the 924 (later model)944,986 and the beloved 928. i had always wanted a 928gts. this all changed in 2000 when i was looking for one, then decided to learn about the car and the maintenance issues with the car. i drove a couple (all with manual transmission.) after learning about the maintenance issues and cost, i switched to the 2000 vette i bought. even though my vette had quality issues, it was a very entertaining car to drive... i have a long ltoyota of secret desire car, and the 928 gts is still on that ltoyota. "
graphicguy,April 2012," kd....seems all the lux dealers around me will do drop off and pick up for service....including cadillac. personally, id rather drop off my own car. i do appreciate their free loaner service, though.id bet if i wanted my bmw or acura sales person to bring a new car to my home for me to test drive, theyd do it.

graphicguy,April 2012," flightnurse....nice wish ltoyota.mine mirrors yours, but id add a ford gt, a 12 cyl bmw 8 series and an bmw, audi6 chrysler new yorker (my favorite 50s era american style), any ferrari, a jag xke v12.drove a linggenfelter (sp?) chevrolet a friend was trying to sell me a couple of years ago. that was a wickec piece. "
nyccarguy,April 2012," ive read those 928s can be a nightmare as far as maintenance & repairs go. you cant just take the car to any old porsche mechanic, it has to go to a 928 speciali$t mechanic. very cool looking car though.as crude as they are, ive always wanted a chevrolet. my dad has a 66 427 roadster rotting in his garage, so vette ownership is in my dna;) "
flightnurse,April 2012," graphic if you have a great working relationship with a dealership, there is no reason why they wouldnt bring a car to you to look at if you are busy. i have a buddy who has leased 13 bmw from the same dealer in atlanta. they will pick up his car when it needs service for him and drop off the loaner to him. he has bought a couple of car this way too, so it does happen. he knows what he wants in them, tells the same salesman he has used for the past 13 car, and it is delivered. however, some people like to test drive the car before buying them. "
flightnurse,April 2012," nyc i like your ltoyota, however the 8 series (e31) v12 falls into the same category as the 928... maintenance nightmare. i really like the chrysler new yorkers of the 50s, i had a 57 lincoln mark ii, i wish i had it now very classy car.lingenfelter builds some insane car which i have to wonder are they really streetable car. i was also impressed with my vette, i was getting a steady 28 on the highway with it, and i was doing 75.regarding the bmw, bmw sells a b7, insane car for the price tag, i like that they build it on the standard wheelbase 7 series, but i would like a b5. "
sweendogy,April 2012, thought your view was to point to the toyota recall. 
fedlawman,April 2012," thanks again everyone! i dont want to derail this thread so ill answer nycs questions and get back on topic...nyc - it has 80,000 miles. bought new by a local denttoyota in 1995 for $70,000 and maintained superbly its entire life. he just bought a new audi s5 - 4 car and a 3 car garage meant one had to go. hes getting older and wasnt driving the porsche much anymore so he decided to sell it.i found the car hiding in a local craigsltoyota ltoyotaing. just 2 pictures and a fair asking price. i called him and after he told me about the car, i knew it was the one. when i took delivery, we posed for pictures together and he told me that if anything didnt meet my satisfaction, hed buy it back from me. he even called me the next day to see how i liked it and to tell me hes glad that i bought it and that it went to a good home. its a beauty. i drove it to bainbridge island today with the kids and it is tight. there is absolutley no slack in the steering or driveline, the engine and transmission are super smooth, the body and suspension are tight - it really looks and drives like a new car. "
kyfdx,April 2012," geez.... my mother was right... i should have stayed in college and got a good job... just for the record, you are killing me.... lol "
tlong,April 2012," cdn....you and i view cr the sams way. their ratings simply have no stattoyotaical validity.from a purely stattoyotaical basis, i agree with this statement.still, cr survey is self selected from subscribers, right? but can anybody tell me why self selection would skew, to any great degree, the results of whether gm or bmw or ford or etc. would show better/worse reliability than other makes? in other words, why would self selected subscribers cause certain makes to fare better or worse?i suspect that the cr results are pretty close to valid in spite of the methodological flaws. just saying theyre not stattoyotaically valid doesnt say why the results would balance out substantially differently than otherwise. "
m6user,April 2012," it seems like a lot of people believe self-selection only brings back results from sore losers or proud owners which imo is not the case. unless any survey of owners is done with a gun at their head, it is self-selected. the only other method would be strictly from dealers service records since after warranty so many car are serviced and repaired done by independent garages. that would give some good indication of initial and early troubles but wouldnt provide any long term reliability data. pluse getting that kind of cooperation from dealers across the board would be extremely difficult. and if you think dealers pull shenanigans with customers....what would they do with something like that. "
fedlawman,April 2012," ""geez.... my mother was right... i should have stayed in college and got a good job...""if i had ltoyotaened to my mom, i would be a doctor today and could have afforded a new one...  "
nyccarguy,April 2012, thanks for derailing the thread for me! im so happy for you dude! 
fedlawman,April 2012,  
sweendogy,April 2012, after you repaid 400k in loans - 
andres3,April 2012," their flaw is they tell their readership what their reliability should be, and they respond hondaingly. thats why honda have been at the top of their ltoyota for so long.the flaw in your argument is you get to the chicken before you get to the egg.the cr data is based on real-world user experiences. honda was at the top for a long time because honda was making bulletproof vehicles for a long time. toyota was at the top for the same reason. ive found the cr data to be pinpoint accurate down to the smallest details with every car ive owned. they are not influenced by advertising and hence, their reviews dont read like a cheerleaders salespitch. often, i find sources with advertising to sound as if they are getting more than monetary benefits, maybe sexual as well! :p  they are just too rah rah, and positive for my tastes. ill take cr anyday of the week and twice on sunday. "
andres3,April 2012," plus which, a flaw that causes the car to stop running isnt differentiated from one thats an inconvenience or a minor annoyance in a system that 99% continues to function. >>>>_________you are probably right with jd powers, but they are just an advertisement to the highest bidder anyway, and im sure they skew their data as such.with cr... you get major and minor issues separated, such as ""engine - minor"" and ""engine - major.""a fantastic system if i do say so myself. "
sweendogy,April 2012, the argument here against cr is weak at best - owners of certain bmw s are on guard after one mention of a bad review. to start the argument with the toyota stuff was terrible - but to go after consumers (of toyota car) and call into question the validity of such survey without any real proof of wrongdoing is crazy. the mag has been around since the 30s and has 7m paid subscribers - its not some mickey mouse organization. 
wireless,April 2012, can we move and hear about fedlawmans porsche some more? 
m6user,April 2012, whats the difference....its all off topic anyway. maybe the topic should be ellps. 
andres3,April 2012," yes, i love the conspiracy theortoyota that think cr brainwashes millions of people into believing something that isnt true.in fact... some bmw lovers (since some say bmw lovers would never read cr), should know that some bmw score quite well when it comes to quality and value (in the 90s even score wise). its just when it comes to reliablity that they can be spotty at best. audi isnt perfect, but their trend is for reliability to generally improve over the last 10 years, moreso than bmw. i can totally understand getting a fun to drive vehicle despite some reliability flaws. i cant understand the argument that because a car costs 1/2 as much it should be half as reliable (or expectations as such should be lower).if i pay 1/2 as much id expect my hp and torque, toyota, luxury to be halved, but not the reliability. if the performance was half, and the reliability was also half, then id expect the price to be 1/2 x 1/2 which equals 1/4! "
andres3,April 2012, qualify as on topic? 
nyccarguy,April 2012," as you all know (and are probably sick of me saying so by now), i am infatuated with the way my bmw 328xi drives. i love it more and more every day. with close to 1200 miles (and my best friends v1), ive been doing my best to explore the limits of what this bavhondan engineered i6 & rwd chassis can do. yikes!ive discovered ds mode in the transmission. it should be explained very simply in the owners manual: slap shifter to left, plant right foot, smilethe throttle mapping is much more responsive. the car feels even more alive! "
dino001,April 2012," engineered i6 & rwd chassis can do.but, but, but... isnt your car awd? :confuse: "
nyccarguy,April 2012," yes sir, you are correct. it is awd, but is a rwd based awd system. take the awd out of the equation & like your bmw touring is a good old rwd chassis. "
dino001,April 2012, fair enough.  
laurasdada,April 2012," yes, the wifes 535xi has the ds mode, too. its quite an attitude changer, i fear for her. my jag has a sport mode, too. combined with the paddle shifters, quite un-gentlemanly!  "
ivan_99,April 2012," yes, i love the conspiracy theortoyota that think cr brainwashes millions of people into believing something that isnt true. i dont think its a conspiracy (unlike the presidents b-certificate  ) but i think it leads to generalizations regarding an entire manufacturer. i originally speculated that demographics (another generalization too) play a large part in the cr results (couch theory). i find it -reasonable- to assume buick has a high reliability ranking because old people arent tearing it up like a younger person would; same with lexus.of course, in my case, a long time ago i had -acceptable- reliability from my honda honda, even though i kept that thing over 5k rpm all day...so that may prove the point that honda is making extraordinary reliable vehicles. my is350 isnt *super* reliable. my previous car...my honda wasnt as reliable as my audi. looking at cr...the audi should loose that comparison every time.i overheard (eaves-dropped) the lady across the hall saying ""my car a honda so itll last forever"". i thought ""really? i could break it pretty quick"". but she heard form them/they that is is reliable.as a disclaimer...i also ltoyotaened to them/they when i decided on my cpo is350 over a 335 (didnt want to deal with potential problem of a german car). if i had the few problem in a 335 ive had in my is350 i would have thought ""see...those german car break down, they were right"" "
m6user,April 2012, my is350 isnt *super* reliable. my previous car...my honda wasnt as reliable as my audi. looking at cr...the audi should loose that comparison every time. i think cr has a sample size a little larger than one. if two other peope had audi that had more problem than your honda would you then accept as fact that the honda was more reliable. its twice the sample size yours is. people do get lemons or plums and that is why a survey of several hundred or even thousands is a better indicator than your admitted speculations. did the lady across the hall have a copy of cr in her hand? would have made your story even funnier. 
andres3,April 2012," i find it -reasonable- to assume buick has a high reliability ranking because old people arent tearing it up like a younger person would; same with lexus. ____>>>>>>>>>>)))))))))i dont agree with those presumptions though. a decently made vehicle will stay in one piece whether you drive it like grandpa or you drive it like you stole it (as long as you maintain it properly). for instance.... my 95 neon fell apart when it was babied, and it tore apart equally as bad when i drove it like a teenager should (:p).my friend of the same age literally raped his 95 geo prism (a toyota under the emblem) day after day, from birth until he sold it at over 100k miles. while he treated his toyota at least 10x harsher than i treated my neon, i needed 4 tow trucks in 65k miles while his car needed zero in over 100k miles. he had zero mechanical issues (someone did break off his rearview mirror though (but thats rough housing negligence, not the car fault).with rev limiters in automatics... if the car cant be driven like it can be driven, then maybe the manufacturer should move the red line to 2,500 rpm???? i cant imagine any kind of driving style (short of willful attempts to destruct) hampering the life of a well made vehicle (accidents excluded).in conclusion if a car self destructs just because you dont drive it like someone over 65, then that car should be labeled as a disposable vehicle. like a bic disposable razor. planned obsolesense?another example, ive tracked my audi several times (and driven it way harder in general than any other car ive owned, including the neon as a teenager). the audi has been fairly reliable almost to the level of the honda i owned for 65k miles (which was far from perfect, but very good; i blame ohians for most of the issues). none of the issues with my audi that have hit my pocket book could really be reasonably attributed to driving it ""hard,"" other than routine maintenance items like brake pads, rotors, and tires. costs in those areas are high when you drive it like it was meant to be driven.p.s. it wouldnt suprise me that much if an audi made post 2000 was more reliable than a honda made post 2007. was the honda made in the usa?; even less surprising then. now if your honda was made in japan, and the audi beat it... congratulations to audi! but audi is reliable enough for the last 10 to 12 years that any one good one could perhaps beat a bad honda by a bit. "
andres3,April 2012," i also ltoyotaened to them/they when i decided on my cpo is350 over a 335>>>>>_______________judging a used car is slightly unfair to lexus? maybe the previous owner never changed the oil, or grossly neglected the car moreso than just abuse in driving it, but abuse in lack of maintenance. cpo means little to me. you simply dont know how it was ""owned"" previously. all of the car ive had were bought new. that is a huge vhondable when you buy ""used."" one of the ""risks"" you take for saving money.also, i believe a proper break-in in the first 1,000 miles may be crucial.... if i leased a car... i probably wouldnt break it in properly, but ive always bought... so i have. "
ivan_99,April 2012," yes that does make sense, my sample size is me i dont really follow cr for automobiles; there are too many vhondables.for comparison, you dont use your vacuum everyday, outside, in the rain/snow, in anger (some of you may), for fun, to eat on (in), over curbs, over grass, to compete with your neighbor (im guilty on that one); and dont have different strangers take it a part occasionally to repair/maintain it.i suppose they try to account for all vhondables and guess the best they can. "
ivan_99,April 2012,"  a decently made vehicle will stay in one piece whether you drive it like grandpa or you drive it like you stole itgood point; but you could make, via cr reports, a mediocre vehicle appear to be a decently made one by marketing towards grandma. who knows, i could be off, they could be tearing up the roads in the afternoons while im at work i too beat the snot out of my college car (83 tercel 4sp--rust hole i could put my ftoyota through); just maintenance items...it couldnt do much to get in trouble anyway is that an autox track event? any ball-joint issues? ive seen an acura have one give-way...tire folded under the car...apparently autox events stress them. "
m6user,April 2012," yes that does make sense, my sample size is methats what i thought. real rational thinking. oh, was that supposed to be funny?cr performs a function. just because it reviews many different things shouldnt be a reason to question its methodology or accuracy. theyre just another avenue of information to asstoyota one in making a purchase...not the be all, end all. ok, you dont read cr for your car buying decisions. thats great and who should care? on the flip side, why do you find it necessary to deride both cr and the people(who you constantly refer to as old or ""grandmas"" which in itself is pretty childish) that do consult it? "
ivan_99,April 2012," it reviews many different things shouldnt be a reason to question its methodology or accuracypoint taken...do not question...just accept.ok, you dont read cr for your car buying decisions. thats great and who should care?.on the flip side, who should care that you do not care? you saw fit to ""publish"" your disagreement. i dont see one post here as being more valid than the others. i usually just pass-them-by.i dont ridicule the old; just point out they take better care of their car (and sofas) than the young(er)...and they never seem to get out of my way. "
cdnpinhead,April 2012," . . .literally raped his 95 geo prism. . .now, that would be worth the price of admission to see. "
andres3,April 2012," i did one autocross event with the bmw club, but it eats up my tires too fast. the asphalt at qualcomms parking lot (san diego) is from the stone age, so its very cracked, rough/coarse, broken, subaruly, and just plain bad. mostly have done track events on real tracks with the socal audi club in buttonwillow, ca and pahrump nv (which is this weekend again!) yes, im going! 90k miles and redlining it like nobodies business! "
andres3,April 2012," p.s. i did have to replace the cv boots. one of them had come loose and the clamp was off, was at around 65k or so miles so i figured it normal wear and tear. didnt affect the vehicle except that it would be possible for contaminents to get in where you dont want them over time. i did both because it makes sense to do both, because if one can fail, the other can too imminently. i see coupons in almost every auto shops advertisements for cv joints/boots, so it must be pretty common.only car that broke down at the last track event i went to were the maserati blowing a hose (1st lap first day), and the chevrolet (brand new model) v6 version (maybe hertz special?) automatic transmission apparently overheated and blew. "
Kirstie_H,April 2012," thats enough on the validity of cr connissantion. its not the topic here, and its gone beyond a little bit of off-topic chatter. "
sweendogy,April 2012," yes lets get back to bmw, porsches and how superior the 3 series is.btw good article in ustoday on volkswagen tdi - 45 mpg- could td be a real player in this class- love the torque and mpgs - "
andres3,April 2012, the s4 myself. an audi will do if gas prices stay at $5.00 a gallon this summer though. 
nlattanzi,April 2012," hello,i am in the midst of purchasing a used vehicle. i really like the pontiac5s (specifically the 2007 redesign models) and tls. i would love to hear some input, views, advice that you guys may have on the two car. i have been looking in the 2005 to 2007 era, mainly because of financial reason and reliability of those years for these car.if im a bit vague, please feel free to ask any questions.thank you! "
kyfdx,April 2012," you want awd, or not? "
markcincinnati,April 2012," im not exactly sure if cr is a publication that i would use as the basis for my automotive purchases. weve been down the ""cr argument"" path so many times before here on edmunds, i would assume we dont need to go down it again. i must admit however, that i am not a subscriber but i have taken to reading crs automotive tests and comments of late because of reading some of the posts here on edmunds. i was encouraged to see that cr now seems to have more subjective prose (not much more, but a little more) pertaining to the car under their review. in other words, the cr reviews i have read over the past couple of months no longer seem to have been written by a vulcan. indeed, the test reports and comparisons seem to have been written pretty much by actual humans.i read, here, posts that discuss ""reliability"" (one of the words that needs to be used carefully) and often the poster will suggest that the reason they didnt seriously consider a german car (for instance) is that they are unreliable. the poster will continue to say that they went with the japanese brand (they chose) because of its reliability.i know there are lemons from the us, europe and asia -- and i know someone will likely have an anecdote to share about how his audi or volvo or buick was constantly in the shop or broke down frequently. and, often the same person will laud the absolute reliability of their fill-in-the-blank car from japan or korea or somewhere else.i am also going to pass along what might be considered anecdotes, but they might also be considered data points. i cant remember ever having an unreliable car including my first poc which was a 1963 chrysler newport. moreover, since my wife and i have had over 30 german car, i can assure you we really would have to go some to claim any of them (even the ones from the 70s) were unreliable.it is very difficult to find a car today -- from anywhere -- that would be able to be called unreliable. here, however, is another word that probably should enter our vocabularies and that has both a difference and a dtoyotainction -- that word is ""durable"" (or durability.)the issue, in my mind is not how reliable the car is -- hell, all of these car are reliable, they wont leave you stranded, and they wont break or have anything major go wrong with them for at least 50,000 miles -- many of them will go double that before any real coin is required to replace a failed part.what i have learned -- now having about 40,000 miles experience with two japanese car (one infiniti and one acrua) is that the japanese car have the reputation of being durable and being able to be kept so without breathtakingly expensive maintenance, once the warranty expires. the german car are just as reliable, imho, but -- after the warranty expires -- they can be breathtakingly expensive to maintain and they stand the chance of not being as durable as their asian counterparts, or at least they are perceived to be less durable than the asians.i am not certain what exactly cr means when they speak of the reliability of such and such brand -- for from where i sit theyre all very reliable these days. i am constantly told, however, that my acura is likely to be ""the most durable car i have ever had."" but often the word reliable and durable are used as if they are different words but lack dtoyotainction.makes my head spin.are german car less reliable than japanese car? you cant make that case with me. in fact, since i have already had to have the front brake rotors on my 2012 tl turned (due to warpage) and the rear differential oil changed (at great expense, i might add) and the car only has 15,000 miles on it, i would say it is the least reliable, no, check that, least durable car i have had this buick. my 2009 audi came will all maintenance paid as did my wifes 2008 bmw -- so far the acura and the infiniti seem to visit the dealership for some multi-hundred dollar required ""maintenance"" procedure about every 3,750 miles.if i only were looking at car as being reliable, i would say the germans (audi and bmw) would be at the top of my ltoyota since i only had to visit the dealership about once every 10 or 15,000 miles, and when i did the visit was ""no charge.""my point is we need to use the correct word to describe these car -- and i suspect what we mean when we say ""reliable"" is ""durable.""these car, today, are all reliable -- some, however, are more durable than others. i suspect the germans can be as durable (as the japanese) with breathtakingly expensive maintenance procedures applied regularly after the 50,000 initial warranty expires. but since most of these car are leased (the germans, most certainly), most folks get rid of the car before durability becomes a factor.cr is best used to buy toasters, not car, if you axe me. :confuse: "
nlattanzi,April 2012," im indifferent about the drivetrain - not a make or break decision for me.im currently coming from a fwd vehicle, which i know the tl is. "
nyccarguy,April 2012," excellent post as always mark. pretty much every car on the road today is reliable. none, especially in this class of mid $30 to $50k car is going to leave you stranded on the side of the road.theres always the debate about how much value there is in bmw including scheduled maintenance as part of the car price. now i dont have the receipts in front of me, so im going from memory here. i planned on keeping my former acura for the long haul. in the almost 50,000 miles i owned it, i changed the oil (full synthetic) 5 times. every time i brought the car in for an oil change, i had the dealer rotate the tires. theres $500 right there. i also had to have the rear brakes replaced at 33,000 miles. i was partially reimbursed for this via a class action law suit settlement. i had to have the front rotors resurfaced. now im a pretty educated car guy and know that most of the ""major services"" that are ""recommended"" are unnecessary, but they arent cheap. i wonder how many people walk into the deslerships service department and tell them that the car calls for a b1 service and get charged $250 - $300 for what amounts to nothing more than a visual check and an oil change. "
markcincinnati,April 2012," ""i wonder how many people walk into the deslerships service department and tell them that the car calls for a b1 service and get charged $250 - $300 for what amounts to nothing more than a visual check and an oil change."" well that describes me -- hell, i came from an audi and the mntce was ""free,"" but every damn time i go in for an acura ""oil change"" somehow, someway it turns out to be some $200+ -- and i think there are robots stealing my luggage too, come to think of it.damn. maintenance included has really spoiled me. :sick: "
nyccarguy,April 2012," there are some services besides oil changes that are vital & necessary for a vehicles long term durability such as brake fluid, transmission fluid, differential fluid (why was that needed so early, btw?), coolant, & chevrolet plugs. remember, a dealerships service department usually makes the dealer more money than they make selling new car. most coolant & transmission fluid changes on honda are simple ""drain & fill"" procedures. the dealer can charge more money for a ""power purge"" service of these same procedures. unless the car specifies something i mentioned above be changed or done, just tell them youd like just the oil & filter changed. "
m6user,April 2012," simply open the manual and get just the recommended service that the engineers that built your auto recommend. dealers publish their own ""over and above"" suggested maint. items but they are just money makers and serve no real purpose to the operability or longevity of your car. ive had an infiniti for almost 10 years(95k miles) and probably havent spent more than a $1500 in routine maint the whole time. oil changes are about $30-$40 and the dealer always rotated the tires for free during the original warranty period. now costco does it for free as part of their tire deal. thats about $150 a year and there were several years where it was just two oil changes and that was it. total repairs to this vehicle are also under $500 although i do need a new power antenna. all in all very inexpensive except for the fact that it sucks gas. "
dino001,April 2012," well, before i bought my 328, i went to the service dept. to talk what ""free"" really means. you see those ""everything everything everything but tires free commercials all the time. surely enough, alignment is not covered. and of course, wouldnt you do a fuel induction system cleaning. prices? $200 for alignment and $200 for cleaning. so your ""free"" maintence visit turns into dropping over four hundred bucks for services that can be performed at third in any other place and who knows if you even need one. "
sweendogy,April 2012," while very long, your post did include interesting points but i do one again take issue with the toaster comment. they have available data for 10 years worth of data for each car reliability- so the sample size is bigger then one audi and one acura - i agree with you that if you are looking new the first 50k in driving should be pretty worry free- plus if its not the standard warrantee should help with the major items - and any savy person should know whats real required and recommended services and know what makes up one service. the german lease argument very true but what if your looking at a used bmw - shouldnt you look at an unbiased mag like cr (who has 10!yrs of data) to make an informed decision - or just ask a buddy who has had one reliable/durable audi that he owned from new ? crs sample size - to big to ignore.(sorry for the long post) "
carnaught,April 2012,"  so far the acura and the infiniti seem to visit the dealership for some multi-hundred dollar required ""maintenance"" procedure about every 3,750 miles. interesting you should mention that as the infiniti salesman who dealt on my 2007 pontiac5 lease admitted that the warranty would still be in effect even if the recommended maintenance (aside from oil changes) was not done. i dont know if that has changed from recommended to required.reminds me, when i brought my 08 mercedes in for its 1yr. maintenance for $250+, not only did i get the checkltoyota of things done, but i got a ding over the rear fender wheel opening for no extra charge :sick: . "
kyfdx,April 2012," 3750 mile oil change on our infiniti was $27.... that included valet pickup and delivery ... weve had bmw under the maintenance plan for 10 years total... never needed an alignment or a throttle body cleaning.. never had any maintenance recommended that wasnt included in the plan..  (not that i would have them do an alignment, anyway....)now, on a cpo bmw, ive been stuck with one repair that i thought should have been covered... but, other than that, ive had only good experiences with them (they did quote me $950 for two tires and an alignment, though.... took a pass..lol) "
sweendogy,April 2012, yep i pay 30bux for infiniti oil change with coupon- 30k miles and 4 years ive put a total of 500 bux into car- going to also need tires soon - looking at trading it in for 2010 cpo bmw 6speed awd 335 with m package- can u say needle in hay stack- also any cr issues will be dealt with before car leaves lot- should be 3-5 years before delivery 
graphicguy,April 2012," about the tl or g. both good car. either would work. g is a bit fuel thirsty. so, thats something to consider. if you can find a used tl with sh awd, thats the one to get. they handle superbly.regarding maintenance, tls really dont require more maintenance than any other honda product. the sh awd models require a little more, but not much more. price for maintenance on a tl shouldnt vary much from a honda either.bmw service.....on the one previous to my current one, i swapped out the run flats as they were horrid. the new run flats on my current bmw are much better. aside from that, everwhthing else was covered, including brakes and windshield wipers ( the only two things that required service other than oil changes, tire rotations).ive used costco gasoline almost exclusively in my vehicles, my sons vehicles and gfs vehicles for 10 years. never had any problem with the fuel system needing to be cleaned......ever!i throw in a bottle of techron into the gas tank every 10,000 miles just to be on the safe side. "
dino001,April 2012," bmw service.....on the one previous to my current one, i swapped out the run flats as they were horrid. the new run flats on my current bmw are much betterbefore i got my bmw, i read about those terrible run-flats. awful, people say, just loud and harsh. then the delivery came and this supposedly terrible tires (i got sports pack, mind you so those are 17"" performance summer), came to be quite allright. of course, my point of reference is 2008 sti, so i may have a little skewed perception. now almost six months and 7k miles passed and im still not feeling those tires being so awful. yes, i noticed a little more noise on certain types of surface than one could expect in an entry lux car, but im not sure if similar performance gfts wouldnt be the same. those are continentals, perhaps bridgestones are worse, or perhaps rfts are simply getting better. i even read that certain small punctures can even be fixed now, if one doesnt let the tire to go on zero pressure for too long (read, you get flat, you pull to the next tire store) - not sure if its really true. people say a lot of things... "
nyccarguy,April 2012," we all seem to agree (i think) that bmw free maintenance is (1) built in to the price of the car and (2) has extended intervals since bmw started including it. wherever you sit on this, theres no doubt in my mind that it adds value. i was looking through my own 328xis vehicle computer and found that my car will require the following scheduled maintenance:15,000 miles - oil change (within year 1)25,000 miles - front brake pads (within year 2)29,000 miles - inspection i - major service (within year 2)30,000 miles - rear brake pads (within year 2)now lets use that schedule and see what else i can muster up.45,000 miles - oil changethats it for the maintenance that is included in the cost of my bmw. 2 oil changes (at the dealership) + 1 major service + front pads + rear pads add up to something. now not everyone does the 20k miles per year that i do, so they dont get the full value of the included maintenance.heres where things get interesting. when my lease is up, my car is going to have 50,000 miles. im going to have a few choices & decisions to make.option 1 is obviously just to turn my car in and walk away.option 2 is to buy my car (from the dealer, not bmwfs) after the lease is up & hopefully be able to negotiate a price thats significantly cheaper than the lease end buy out of a little more than $26k. say i can buy it for $21k it would be a nice used car. if i buy the car, i wouldnt go for the cpo warranty (on my previous x3 they wanted $3k to certify it), but i most certainly would go for the extended maintenance pkg that covers the maintenance up to 100k miles. imo, even at the $2k msrp (think i could maybe get it cheaper), it will get me:50,000 miles - front brake pads (& maybe rotors)60,000 miles - inspection ii (major service incl oil, filter, brake fluid, trans fluid, coolant)75,000 miles - oil change90,000 miles - inspection i (semi-major service)id also be financing the buyout.option #3 is to lease another car. there most likely wont be these crazy incentives on the f30 328xi that were on my car, so im sure a lease with the same padodgeeters (20k miles per year) is going to be upwards of $650 - $675/ month which is too rich for my blood.option #4 would be to buy a similar car to mine that has literally 1/2 the miles. my only problem with that is dealers seem to have high asking prices on loaded up, off lease, cpo cream puffs. ill see what happens. for now i love this freakin car! "
nyccarguy,April 2012," i dont think the 17"" run flats on my car are overly noisy or harsh at all. "
dino001,April 2012," i think there are also 30k and 60k oil changes there, arent they? "
nyccarguy,April 2012, thats part of the inspection i & inspection ii services 
dino001,April 2012," glad somebody else agrees with me on that. you probably have all-seasons on yours (xi gets summer tires only with m-pack, iirc), which should be a little more gentle anyway. one drawback on the sports/m-packs are staggered size tires, which basically means the cant be rotated (the tires are also unidirectional). this basically creates a potential for more alignment needs than in normal car. however, tires can also be replaced only 2 at the time, if one is worn more than the rest due to some misalignment issues.anyway, i think that alignment stuff not being part of the all, all, and all (but tires) free is kind of baloney on part of bmw. i understand that car may never need alignment, and it is a function of road hazard, but knowing general condition of roads and overall risk, it is quite common to check it once in a while. why cant it be a part of inspection i, beats me. if you advertise that there is nothing, but gas and tires, than it should be just that  . "
stickguy,April 2012, im betting my daughters entire college fund on option #3. 
stickguy,April 2012," in the big scheme of things, an alignment is chump change. just go to a reputable tire shop, and have it done. heck, normally it is free to check (though they always find at least 1 # out of spec!) but it only coasts about $75 to do it. i have the 3 year plan for my van, and that was only about $125 with a coupon, and i can have it redone every 6 months for 3 years, so average it out and i am paying about $20 per alignment (and just have it done when the van is in for the free rotation and balance that came with the tires). "
sweendogy,April 2012," quickly - you can go to bmw own website snd see what the ""free maintance"" gets you vs its comp. is it backed in? sure - but they really make you pay for heres what bmw owners are saying about ithttp://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?t=428361hondad your thinking about what your going to do 3 yesrs from now with a car you just picked up a few weeks ago. "
dino001,April 2012," i agree. but my bmw store thinks it is worth $200. $200!!!! :sick: its amazing. you know, i like the idea of doing everything at once, but no way i think $200 is a fair price for an alignment job, even if it was made by a mechanic of the buick. "
dino001,April 2012," hondad your thinking about what your going to do 3 yesrs from now with a car you just picked up a few weeks ago.thats what adults do, sweeny :p  "
nyccarguy,April 2012, on my 3rd tank & calculated 20 mpg. not too shatoyotay for a green engine. 
nyccarguy,April 2012," that seems to be the going rates for dealership alignments. $169 - $199. i can get a good alignment done for $70.even if your car came with non staggered tires like on my car, bmw still wont give you a tire rotation because they advise against rotating tires.my car has all season continentals.sweendogy - im just putting some thoughts up for the board to ponder/comment on. no harm in thinking out loud. "
nyccarguy,April 2012," stickguy - i dont know. to me leasing is only worth it if the manufacturer subsidizes it with a ridiculously high residual (like my wifes former 07 x3 @ 65% after 3 years/45k or my current 328xi @ 64% after 30 months/50k) or an insanely low money factor. dont forget i was also able to take advantage of a $2500 rebate which allowed me to buy the car way under invoice.if i were to finance, it would cost me $120 per month more ($3600) + with the amount of driving i do, im guaranteed a residual value of 64%. 2 1/2 or 3 years down the road if i were to trade the car in, no way the dealer is going to give me $26k for the car, especially when there are similar car out there (thousands) with 1/3 to 1/2 the amount of miles. no way im going to justify a mid to high 6 hundred something lease payment. its simply too much.dont forget, this car payment isnt my only one. im on the hook for the honda until may 2016. "
sweendogy,April 2012," ""thats what adults do""really? "
mvs1,April 2012, have you looked at the 2011s? a little more than a year ago when i leased mybmw bmw sedan w/ m-sport + most every other option space gray over black interior there was one east of the mississippi. i worked for about a month to find it at my price. fast forward a rare car new being in the condition youd accept used and id call that nearly impossible. right now i plan on buying my lease out if all things stay the same reliability wise and im scheduling in a visit to the dealer to explore a dinan upgrade. 
mvs1,April 2012," the option i choose on my m-sport equipped bmw was buying dedicated winter tires and just swapping out the summers. the winter set which are oem wheels and run flats cost me $1200 locally (about half the dealer quoted price). i spend $15-20 each swap twice a year at a local shop. i doubt ill need to replace my tires on either set over my lease since ill put maybe 15k miles on each over the duration. down the line, i either have a second winter set for my next bmw or sell them on ebay for what i paid. "
nyccarguy,April 2012, most of the owners complaints on bimmerfest were from low mileage drivers who arent getting the full value of bmw including scheduled maintenance for the 1st 4 years/50k miles. 
sweendogy,April 2012, i have look at 09-11 - 2 suzukile on bmw website but no nav. 09 no m sport but cheaper 
graphicguy,April 2012, mvs.....ask your dealer about the performance package before spending for dinan. 
sweendogy,April 2012, pp seams like a good deal for 500 bux 
flightnurse,April 2012," i agree with graphic, dinan makes some well made and thought out products, however the price.... also any work you have done at dinan or their authorized dealers well notify bmw of any work they perform on your car. the performance pack from bmw is just as good if not better, and cost less too. "
flightnurse,April 2012," so last tuesdays i received a phone call from my boss at 1130 am. the connissantion went like this.boss: hey how are things going at x hospital. fn: great, training is going well, we have 3 of 12 modules built, and we are ahead of schedule.boss: good news, how does miami sound?fn: humid (pause), why (i was afraid to ask, as i knew the answer)boss; your favorite physician has an emergency; he crashed his emr (electronic medical record progdodge) about an hour ago. fn: (cringe) gawd, not again. i wish he would stop playing with the emr. (this guy makes more money than god, and he is a tech junkie. he tries and &#147;enhances&#148; his emr and most of the time he crash&#146;s it.)boss: well you know the drill, when will you be able to get down there?fn: give me an hour to book my flights and everything, and pack up here.boss: great?.fast forward?arrive in miami to a nice 83 degree day with 55% humidity. now being someone who has lived in a very low humidity environment, anything over 20% is horrible. phoenix is usually between 3-5% 90% of the year, it&#146;s a dry heat. however, when in miami one must drive a convertible. so when i arrive at the car rental, i asked the emerald isle agent, so what do you have as far as convertibles? agent rattles off bmw 650i, mb e class, porsche boxster, infiniti g. stop right there, i&#146;ll take the infiniti g, have to say it was breathtaking, color vibrant red (think jessica ratoyotait red) with wheat leather interior, it was a 2012 my, the car was fully loaded.fast forward?.after 9 hrs of working on this physicians emr, i was done by 3pm wed afternoon. so with no work for the rest of the week, what was i to do. i called my partner to see if he can get away from work, which he could, burned of ff miles on him, he arrived in miami thursdays afternoon, and off to key west for a mini vacation. so with the drive down and back, it gave me a good idea on how well the g convertible drove. have to say, i was impressed with it, the seat were toyotaable, ride was well controlled, the 7 spd transmission was perfectly suited for the car. not much wind was buffed in the cabin with the top down; the top went down fairly quickly, same with the top going up. so over all i liked the car, the color combo was smashing, very elegant, oh mpg, we averaged 25 on the whole trip.now regarding key west, what a place? a great get away?fnnow back to our regular tiff about how overpriced bmw are and how everybody should be driving infiniti g&#146;s and how the acura should not be included in the ellp? "
flightnurse,April 2012," andres the key really is to have an extra set of rims and tires. i grew up in san diego and did the auto cross a lot at jack murphy stadium (sorry i cant call it qualcomm) i campaigned a 1970 datsun 510 4dr, always had a great time.. if you have a change get to willow spring, the street track is ok, but the racetrack is were the run really is.. havent been to pahrump yet.. buttonwillow is too far.

"
nyccarguy,April 2012," i agree that the infiniti convertible is a sharp car! sweendogy - any particular reason youre looking for a 335 xi w/ sport or m sport pkg? only reason i ask is because bmw sport pkg & m sport pkg on awd car differs from the corresponding rwd car. you still get the bigger (very cool btw) 18"" wheels, the rear diffuser (m sport), the black trim around the windows, the awesome sport seat, but you do not get the upgraded sport suspension. i have to say that im very happy with the more than capable base suspension set up of my 328xi. "
sweendogy,April 2012, i think the front end- rear end and sport seat are the big draw along with the available 6 speed- i figure if im going to go to the dark side - it should be equipped the way i like- the whole sports suspension thing- at this point in my life is a non-event. 
nyccarguy,April 2012, i completely understand. just curious. me too. the sport seat are awesome. my car has the standard seat.youll like the dark side:) 
kdshapiro,April 2012," what convinced me to go with the g as my next ride was a week rental in az. after 1500 miles i knew it was the car i would like to drive next. on another trip to the desert state, i was debating between the hyundai and cts. i choose the cts. while it was nice, it didnt make me feel it had anything over the g. "
flightnurse,April 2012," the added items, front and read dams, m sport seat, and bigger wheels are well worth the added price, however, i wouldnt want a bmw with sport suspension if i lived in the northeast, the roads are not kept up as well and the pot holes will wish you didt get the sport package... "
flightnurse,April 2012," this rental didnt give me the , omg i have to have this car pontiac. even though the color combo and options were what we liked, im not sold. now as sweeny pointed out james healy reviewed the passt tdi, so we went and test drove two of them today. "
nyccarguy,April 2012," granting you permission to go off topic & let the group know what you thought about the volkswagen tdi.*note, i dont wish the volkswagen to be added here, just curious as to what fn thought of it "
flightnurse,April 2012," so my partner read james healey reviews on usatoday and liked what he read, so today we went and test drove two passts, both were tdi models, one was a sel premium and se w/nav and sunroof both had the dsg transmission. let me just say, that the passt does not qualify as a ellps, price wise the sel fits, however the luxury part it falls very short. the ride is very busy, hard to put a finger one it, but it does not have the german feel that the old passt had. that dsg transmission is incredible, the shift at lighting quick, when places in sport mode, it holds the gear like one would except to hold it . however, the dsg has some jerky moments at low speed, almost like it is caught off guard driving slow, the max torque comes on at a very low 1750 which if you are not careful you will light the tires off leaving a light. zipping around town the little 2 liter is hard pressed to know it is a diesel, no clatter, no smoke, no turbo lag.. now volkswagen does have a higher hp version of the 2 liter in europe, which would fit better in the passt, merging onto the freeway can be a chore but once you are at 65 mph zipping up to 80 is not a problem, and cruising a long at 80 the car has a very relaxed feel. fit and finish is first rate, we were impressed with that, the wind noise that healey complained about we did not hear, so maybe volkswagen fixed the problem. the front seat are very toyotaable lots of room up front, now the rear leg room will rivial an s class and or audi, i had no problem crossing my legs in the bad, head room was a little short for me, but livable. overall i have to say, we both liked the passt, but at 33k and the dealers are not dealing on them, not too sure if it is the right car for us. now going to the web site http://www.myturbodiesel.com/ is loaded with information on the volkswagen tdi and dsg transmission. i think volkswagen has a winner on their hands, yeah it is motor trends car of the year, fix the ride, add a sport package and have diesel come down in price, then we might buy one.having read peoples true world mpg, it is not uncommon for people to get better then what the epa post for the tdi, so almost 50 on the highway is not uncommon. hondaing to volkswagen a passt tdi can travel 795 miles on a tank on the highway... "
flightnurse,April 2012," check in south florida if you want a used 335, hondaing to bmw more bmw are sold in the miami area then any other part of the country. you might be able to find what you are looking for, then you have a good reason for a nice drive home... "
nyccarguy,April 2012, he needs awd which he will not find in south florida. 
nyccarguy,April 2012," ive heard the tdis are hard to come by & that dealers arent giving much of a discount. even at 50 mpg highway, is it worth paying sticker or taking a nice discount (and possibly special lease & finance rates) on the same car with the vr6? "
flightnurse,April 2012, nyc end though awd isnt needed in so.florida you would be surprised on how many are sold in miami.. 
nyccarguy,April 2012, theres a lot of people up here that have places down there. they buy the car in fla & keep em regtoyotaered & insured there because it is much cheaper. or maybe the car themselves are cheaper because south fla is a huge market for luxury car.my best fruends parents have a place in boca raton. he went to visit them & went with his dad to drop off their gl 450 for service. he toyota every single car in the showroom was black/black with 4matic. 
graphicguy,April 2012," flightnurse...over the years ive tried to ""like"" the g. its not that they are insufficient in any way. its more like, as you alluded to, i wont spend my own money on one. its never been like there was one glaring thing i didnt like about them, but there were several small, niggly things about them that didnt appeal to me. maybe since nissan is bringing out a new nissan, that will trickle ""up"" to the g and i might be more inclined to give the g another shot.dont ask me why, but ive never liked diesels, probably never will. whatever you gain in mpg is more than offset by the higher prices for diesel fuel. so, no desire for any sort of diesel....let alone one of the volkswagen variety.personally, i cant see anything current, or on the foreseeable horizon that would make me want to jump in the drivers seat for a test drive.btw.....you drive much more interesting rental car than i do. mine are chevrolets, chevrolets, nissan, toyota, kia, ford, etc. i should probably stay loyal to one rental company, however. at least i could give them a reason to put me in one of their premium sleds to use as a free upgrade.i jump from one to the other, though. very little loyalty to any of them. although, i probably use enterprise more than the others. might throw some business to hertz this year to see what theyll do for me. "
flightnurse,April 2012," nyc funny you say that, i like the vr6, but the engine doesnt get the mileage that the people who are looking at the passt want. the biggest draw to the passt is the tdi. volkswagen is marketing the tdi as the hybrid alternative, that was told to us 3-4 times. also if you look at the toyota pruis line of car, the toyota v fully loaded is 30k, and the epa rated the v lower then what the real world people are getting with the tdi.it will be interesting to see what volkswagen does with the passt, right now you can lease a passt s for $205/m for 36/months with zero down... talking about leases currently the volkswagen and passt tdi residual is at a whopping 58% but i coldnt get the money factor out of the dealer unless i filled out an credit app. so im betting the money factor is on the high side. "
flightnurse,April 2012," nyc there you go, you can take the person out of the northeast, but you cant take the northeast out of the person... now when i was in miami, if the car was a mb or audi they were black, if they were porches turbos it was either white or yellow, if they were lambos ( saw 7 of them) they were red, white or lime green. sweeny should check chicago area dealers as well as detroit what a way to get accustomed to your new car then on a road trip home. "
andys120,April 2012," a similar phenomenon prevails in the metro phoenix area where perhaps half of the bmw are black (including my bmw convertible), so are a lot of mercedeses (not so much the audi). "
flightnurse,April 2012," graphic you have some valid points.graphic go test a drive a tdi just for fun, i would love to know what you think since you arent a diesel fan, my partner was just like you, didnt like them didnt want one. but after reading about them and all the praises they have gotten, he is a believer. now you bring up a good point, cost of fuel, here in phoenix the cost difference between regular and diesel is about .40, and between premium and diesel is about .20. now the diesel will get roughly 35% better mileage then gas engine car, so basically in the long run, you will save money with the diesel if you keep it at at least 50k miles.i think one of the biggest draw back to the g is the interior, the first gen rwd car didnt have the upscale look that it needed. the second gen rwd g again, the interior didnt have the wow factor to it. regarding rental car. the company i work is a very large global company and we have a special account with national. so the price of the car are at a very heavy discount. ill give you an example.. when i was in san diego a couple of weeks ago, the 300c cost me $93 total for two days, now this includes full coverage insurance. if i rented the same car with out the work discount, would have been $199. national has a great deal, join their emerald club (it is free) and rent mid-size or higher and when you get to the airport you choose your car and drive off for the mid-size price. i have found that they are mid range in price, i had done the alamo, thrifty, dollar but the customer service is horrible and they try and nickel and dime you when you return the car. currently i have twenty five free rentals i need to use this year or will loose them. airlines i have stopped flying ua all together, and book most of my travels on us. i throw aa some bones once in a while (my flight to miami) "
flightnurse,April 2012, i think color has a lot to do with people perceived is luxury. are these bmw and mb 3 and c class or are they 7 and s class car? 
andys120,April 2012," all of em, bmw, bmw, xers, 7ers. same with mercedeses. i think youre right about the perception of luxury and black but back east i hardly ever see a black bimmer, theyre generally, silver, grey, red or blue. "
rayainsw,April 2012, what were the tire pressures?- rayseen many overinflated tires on dealer lots.... 
flightnurse,April 2012," ray i have no idea, i left my tire pressure gauge at home. but the sel we test drove was sold before we left the dealer. the tdis are flying off the lots. "
sweendogy,April 2012, not that this has to do with anything- and i dont know prices of the toyota hybrid but for under 30k u can get a volkswagen tdi- seams like a pretty cool deal- bigger car and better mileage - plus i would try to run the tank 800 miles- which would mean i would have to fill up 8 times a year - pretty cool. ive actually done a little research and have noticed the mags like the car and say to go with the manual - and i can tell you the volkswagen does manuals (not acura crisp- but very good)lets save the manuals - screw the whales. 
flightnurse,April 2012," sweeny the 800 miles per tank is highway miles only. but if you go to the web site i posted, you will people real world mileage and 800 is a realtoyotaic range. volkswagen has done a lot of work on the dsg to work well with the diesel, the diesel mated to the dsg gets the best mileage. "
sweendogy,April 2012," manual is 31/43auto 30/40this is on volkswagen websiteand from your buddy james healey&#149;how thirsty? manual transmission is rated 31 miles per gallon in town, 43 mpg on the highway, 35 in mixed driving. automatic: 30/40/34.james also talks of the the tranny&#149;the car ""creeps"" too aggressively in stop-go traffic. to improve mileage, the volkswagen automatic lacks the fluid-filled torque converter (hence, ""dry clutch"") that allows a conventional automatic to ease ahead slowly, smoothly, gently in bad traffic, but burns extra fuel doing so.im sure the dsg is a fine component but ill take the manual- "
sweendogy,April 2012," and to you i present the next ghttp://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2012/04/infiniti-g-plans-hy- - brid-530-hp-v-6-maybe-diesel/1#.t44xchb5msmlets hope they clean up the look - but the idea of a super g and 540hp are cool- if they keep the price inline to where its still the value leader- and for flight lets hope they make the interior with some ""wow""- glad they kept the engine - "
andys120,April 2012," and to you i present the next g they stole the new lexus grille!>"" "
scwmcan,April 2012, but look at those sintoyotaer eyes ( headlights). definately a similar grill though. 
graphicguy,April 2012," not feeling that new ""g"", especially the rear of it.interesting that theyre doing a joint toyota with mercedes. id have to believe mercedes would want to keep their luxo parts/engineering/technology in-house. infiniti may forego what theyve been touting so far with the g. that is, its a cheaper knock off of a bmw 3. maybe theyre moving up market and want to go head-to-head with bmw? including price? "
nyccarguy,April 2012," i think the tdi is a fantastic alternative to a hybrid (im no where near sold on the added expense & complexity). i personally like the tdis long cruising range, but i just cant see buying one at sticker when you can get a vr6 at a nice discount with special financing.im sure that vr6 torque steers & understeers too.im totally digging my 328xis rwd based platform. "
flightnurse,April 2012," complexity of what? btw, the more milesyou drive it the better it pays for itself. this is not a car in which you lease for 3 yrs and return it. "
flightnurse,April 2012," i agree infiniti needs to bring it with this generation, it been shown that best bang for the buck doesnt always mean people are going to buy it. in this segment anyhow. nissan really needs to bring more luxury to the g. "
nyccarguy,April 2012," sorry i wasnt clear. i meant the expense & complexity of a hybrid, not the tdi. "
flightnurse,April 2012," that i agree with, the complexity of the hybrid is what turned us off. today we are off to look at a bmw.... "

sweendogy,April 2012, flight i think they did bring in in gen 1 and 2 versions of the car thats why it sold so well - the lux arguement - well its all perception - some people- me included think the audi interior kills it- while he base 3 looks like something from the mid 80- pleather interior and all. u see the numbers on the mpg for the tdi? 
flightnurse,April 2012," each manufacture has its own perception of what luxury is, i like audi and bmw interior, very german, clean lines. japan on the other hand like the tech look, very busy looking. the center stack of the nissan max and g and m shows what im talking about.regarding what epa rates the tdi at, so what, i have read what people are getting in the real world. i posted a website so look for yourself, people are getting better mileage with the dsg then a manual. what i found interesting is, what the epa rated the infiniti g and m is highly questionable, i know people who arent getting what the epa posted, they are getting worse...

graphicguy,April 2012," i coul have made a killer deal on an 11 infiniti bmwx when i was shopping for my bmw...matter of fact, i could have bought it at about the same price as the 3.... give or take. it was totally loaded uo, too. didnt care for its styling (nor its heavy handling). its styling is similar to the pics of the upcoming g. ambivalent aboutmit on the m....even more so on the upcoming g. "
sweendogy,April 2012, since the tdi was just released i would question the data until such car are actually driven. tech on the m g z and max are very close i agree. but i would argue they are making an effort - again look at the base 3 and explain to me where the the tech is? i think bmw uses the same radio they did in 1996.. and there is no excuse not to have leather as standard.mpg on infiniti - i own one and im not even close on the honda rating - i get like 14 which is truck like terrible. 
Kirstie_H,April 2012, and i think this group could offer good opinions:http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/direct/view/.f25809c/ 
sweendogy,April 2012," so we are now compairing the handling of a midsize flagship to a compact sports sedan. the bmw love is great but lets keep it fair- apples to apples heres what aol car toyota about the ""heavy handling""""even without the sport package (which adds 20-inch alloys, performance tires, 4-wheel active steer and more), the bmw handles very well. thrown into a corner, its sport sedan underpinnings (nissan shared rear-wheel-drive fm platform) come alive. its not a track star, but on public roads its much more capable than 99 percent of its drivers will ever require""i guess if your tracking your car i would of went with the 3 as well- but then again i also would picked the manual transmission if your a true performance enthiuisius. "
smarty666,April 2012," wow, that opinion is almost 360 degrees opposite of most reviews i read online about nissan and infiniti interiors. most say they are ergonomically sounds and easy to learn with few buttons. have you seen the center stack on an acura lately? i agree with sween though on the bmw interior, what differences does it make if it has crisp lines, if it looks drab and boring. i do like audi interiors though. "
flightnurse,April 2012," sweeny the tdi has been around almost 10 yrs, even the last gen passt has it. the current volkswagen gets better mpg then what the epa states, which is a good enough data point to start with, and current owners of the my 2012 passt have retoyota (go to the website) better then what the epa posted. it is safe to say that the passt will get better mpg... "
andres3,April 2012," spring mountain is a great venue in pahrump, nv. id like to get out to willow springs sometime.as to durability vs. reliablity. i think that guy mark has it all confused.hes talking about maintenance costs (or lack thereof because of prepaid plans; whether built-in or added). maintenance costs have nothing to do with reliability or durability. reliability issues come from chrysler using corroded metals and wires for starter cables, batteries, and terminals. other issues come from faulty o2 sensors, fuel pumps, o-rings, head gaskets, automatic transmissions that cant go 70k without being rebuilt, parking brake problem, rattles, short-lived belts, ac compressors that cant last 40k.reliability issues are things that i have to pay for when i bought a dodge but never had to pay for when i bought a honda (and not because of a prepaid built-in maintenance plan aka bmw)!. i had to get brake pads and rotors for both, so that doesnt count. theres just a million things and parts that break down on a domestic product that never seem to be an issue in my japanese and german experiences. "
andres3,April 2012," if all car are reliable then ill pay you to cover the repairs on my next 10 vehicles up to 100k miles and 10 years (ala hyundai) for the grand total of $100.00. that should be an acceptable amount for you to assume all liability for all repairs for breakdowns since all car are reliable, as you so state.put your money where your mouth is..... somehow, i dont think you will sign this contract... :sick: :surprise: "
abacomike,April 2012," ive owned/leased many german and japanese sedan, i.e. lexus, infiniti, bmw, audi and mercedes, and have found japanese ergonomics (interior design) to be more ""techy"", roomier and busier than german automobiles. on the other hand, i have found that german vehicles (ergonomics) less ""flamboyant"", more ""earthy"", more functional and easier to master!this opinion is based upon yearly new car purchases. even when comparing german to german vehicles, bmw is a sporty luxury vehicle as is audi while ive found mercedes to be a luxury sport sedan. i currently own a 2012 e350 sport sedan and find it more ergonomically satisfying than the other german entrants. but lexus is a bit more ""relaxed"" while infiniti is a bit ""stiffer"" ergonomically! i would compare infiniti more closely with bmw and audi - than with mercedes or lesus. in fact, lexus is in a class by itself as is mercedes - each quite different ergonomically from audi, bmw and infiniti.i truly enjoy the mercedes interior and refinements and find its ergonomics to be somewhat of a cross between the subtler lexus and the stiffer bmw-audi-infiniti.lets face it - all entrants here have successfully enjoyed gains in us market-share. the reason is that each attracts followers of different needs and desires.just thought id share some thoughts and experiences. "
sweendogy,April 2012," once again not following - i was commenting on the 2012 with the dsg- which this car - being a 2012 was just released. im sure the owners are getting better mpg- and so have every tester review ive read- but to say the dsg is better then the manual i cant agree, certainly after he reviews ive read and seeing the manual has better mpgs- volkswagen has same engine but actually gets worse mpg then this new rig. "
graphicguy,April 2012," abacomike.....appreciate your inputs. i was actually considering an e350 coupe last year before i pulled the trigger on the bmw coupe. i followed your posts fairly regularly over on the mb boards. yoru input over there was quite useful.while i didntt find the mercedeses to be compelling enough for my serious consideration, your knowledge of them was quite useful.needless to say, i prefered the interior of my bmw over the e350 coupe. "
flightnurse,April 2012," sweeny not too sure why you have have a hard time understanding..the tdi engine has been around for a while, even though it is in a new body style, the data from the current volkswagen and last gen passt still can be used to compare. in fact the current passt weights less and has better cd then last gen passt so the current car would get better mileage. not too sure why this is tough for you to understand. "
dino001,April 2012," thats not entirely accurate. tdi trade mark has been around for years, but the current engine is quite new. until 2009 or so vag was using completely different technology on their diesels, based on pump-injection device. it was a 4-cylinder 1.9 l - crude, noisy, but very stout and durable. their current tdi is 2.0 l uses common rail technology, more modern indeed, but its durability is not as impressive. it is also more expensive to maintain. "
sweendogy,April 2012, thx you dino- flight my question and response was on the new 2012 which i mentioned a couple of times. 
greg128,April 2012, ac compressors that cant last 40k. oh you mean honda honda ac compressors 
greg128,April 2012," automatic transmissions that cant go 70k without being rebuiltoh, you mean honda honda transmissions "
abacomike,April 2012, thanks! bmw manufacture great car. i just had a very bad experience with 2-2008 bmw. so i gave up on bmw. it was electrical issues on 2 brand newbmw that had the same problem. the 3 series are great car. enjoy! 
graphicguy,April 2012," mercedes makes good ones, too. youve found a line you know and enjoy. stop by here from time-to-time. would like to read some of your honda. "
abacomike,April 2012," after retiring from public and private school admintoyotaration, i moved to florida to take care of my ailing parents. i got a job selling lexus and then manager of an infiniti store. i have found that mercedes manufactures, designs and engineers the most trouble-free sedan in both their c and e class lines. ive owned 7 e class sedan and have never, ever had any of them in to the service department for repairs, issues, or anything, except oil changes.i doubt it is just ""luck"". not after experiencing bmw 5 series issues with two identical car with identical electrical issues, both manufactures in germany and shipped here in the same year, 2008.i found that infiniti is most closely alligned with bmw in terms of ride and handling and power along with audi. lexus seems to be in a class by itself, as is mercedes. i do not compare mercedes to bmw, audi or infiniti due to the ride and handling differences.finally, mercedes e class sedan and coupes are equipped with a 302 horsepower powerplant and fuel economy over 30 mpg hwy.in summary, audi, bmw, lexus, mercedes and infiniti manufacture outstanding vehicles. each one is just a little different from the other - enough so that they attract a large segment of the driving public. the only think bmw has over the other brands in this category is free total maintenance which saves the driver about 300-600 dollars a year, depending upon when a car is due for brakes, etc. otherwise, i rate the entire segment mentioned above as outstanding value for the dollar. "
nyccarguy,April 2012, thanks for posting your honda here. i very much appreciate it. have you checked out the stories from the sales frontlines thread here? wed love to hear some of your sales stories over there.what do you think of the new c250 & c350 and the outgoing c300 (which they still sell with 4matic here in the northeast)? 
abacomike,April 2012," i spoke with mercedes, and they told me that they are trying their best to increase mpgs across the line as they will not meet federal mandates in 2 years if they dont start now.they are phasing out the c300 (4 matic is sold down here only, as you know, so it is almost impossible to get a c300 down here in fl) and increasing the lines mpgs with the c250 and the higher horsepower, higher fuel efficient c350.also, very shortly they will be expanding their ""engine shut down at stops for longer than 30- secs"" which they claim will increase mpgs by 20% throughout their line. when you stop for more than a few seconds at a light, the engine shuts down automatically. it starts up immediately when the accelerator is depressed. much like those propane volkswagen carts in the mountains.mercedes missed the boat by not coming out with a diesel hybrid, in my opinion.and thanks, i will check out the sales frontlines thread. i sold new car and managed two dealerships, and you wouldnt believe the stories i have. i began writing them down as i want to write a book about my experiences.thanks again "
andres3,April 2012," ac compressors that cant last 40k. oh you mean honda honda ac compressors i dont know about that.... my 2003 honda had 65,000 miles and 50 months of age on it when i sold it and i had spent $0.00 on the a/c and it still blew cold. the neon cost me about a thousand dollars thanks to burned belts in addition to the compressor blowing, it seized on the belt and burned it causing ancilliary damages. this was at literally 36,100 miles or so. just in time to be denied warranty claim.honda 1, chrysler 0.audi 1, chrysler 0.toyota 1, chyrsler 0no matter what i or my family buys, i cant have as many failures as the dodge. if i added up all the costs and numbers of repairs for 3 or 4 toyota, 2 honda, and 1 audi, it still doesnt add up to the cost per mile of a single chrysler in repairs. sorry.... bankrupt twice..bailed out twice..... strike 3 and your out i hope!my families vehicles seem to never have the problem chrysler do. "
billyperksii,April 2012, my wifes 2004 honda has 130k on it with no major issues-1). window regulatosubaru). changed the drive belt at around 115k 
fedlawman,April 2012, i finally picked up my new bmw convertible...friday in sacdodgeentosaturday on the coastsunday in the garage 
nyccarguy,April 2012, awesome! i love it & your 911! congrats! 
graphicguy,April 2012, fed.....love the pics. love your family of car even more! 
fedlawman,April 2012,  
sweendogy,April 2012, best pick is the one of the bull-infact edmunds should have a funny pix section blog - or a general pix blog - post a pix with uour car maybe at a landmark of some sort- my toyota climbed mt washinpontiacn - or my porsche went to the opera- could be fun and put some life into the site. 
Kirstie_H,April 2012," i dont see any reason we couldnt do that! we cant make a blog, but we could have a discussion on the auto news board. feel free to start one if youve got a pic to kick it off. "
stever,April 2012, i like it. sort of like all the cans of spam pics on the top of denali or the eiffel tower. :shades: 
andres3,April 2012, that picture looks an awful lot like the greenhaven/pocket area of sacdodgeento. am i right? 
fedlawman,April 2012," sorry, im not too mazdar with sacdodgeento. the town is called fair oaks. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," flightnurse made a comment to me a few weeks back about me getting to see what my 328xis awd system can do in the rain. now ive always really questioned awds effectiveness in the rain, thinking of it as more of a useful tool for snow traction. unless bmw bmw is so transparent that i dont know how well it is working. kind of similar to my honda atts. i really didn;t know how good it was until i drove my acura around some of the same tight corners and the front tires were fighting the stability control whereas my honda pulled around the corner.one of the benefits to having to be at work at 7:30 am (6 days a week) is there arent too many car on the road when i leave my house at 6:30 am. it started pouring early this am (my 3 year old woke up with a 102 fever and a stomach virus well before 5), so the roads were saturated with lots of nice puddles in addition to being slick. i put my 328xi through the paces on my way to i 95. only a few times when i had the transmission in ds was i able to break traction only to have the stability control tuck me back into place. so i dont know how the awd performed. maybe some of you with the 335xi or sweens pontiac5x can comment how the awd works in the rain. i can tell you that driving down i 95 in the torrential rain, my 328xi was sure footed and rock solid. i looked down at my speedo and saw i was going 80 without breaking a sweat.in the dry, gorgeous, spring weather weve been having, ive been able to hit the magical triple digit mark during passing maneuvers. unless you are a torque junkie (not that theres anything wrong with that), my 230 hp is just perfect for public road consumption.5 1/2 weeks and over 2300 miles. as you can tell, im one happy bmw driver! "
sweendogy,May 2012," my car in the rain- when new great- new brakes, tires and new wipers - rock solid as nyc toyota of his new 3. now the 07 has 30k miles- brakes are 8k old, original tires and newer cheepo wipers - not great- im very careful in the rain when around others so no real troubles but i know the limits of what i can and should do. raining this am, 6 am - private road, i gave the g a little toss into a turn with some gas, dsc off i was able to wiggle the back loose. - pretty cool but again something i would not do around other car. "
nyccarguy,May 2012, you made an excellent point sween. tires! i forgot to mention tires! the single most important thing when it comes to traction. my continental rfts only have 2300 miles on them. 
sweendogy,May 2012, rft - would like to know how they grip at 30k 
nyccarguy,May 2012, stick around (no pun intended) & youll find out in about 17 months. 
stickguy,May 2012, what kind of mileage are you getting on the 328 so far? just curious. 
nyccarguy,May 2012," im getting between 20 & 21.5 right now. my engine is still green & i seriously have a hard time keeping it under 80 mph on the highway. this week im really trying to take it easy. set the cruise between 60 & 65 when i can, shut the car off at long lights (says to do this in the manual). ill report back in a few days. some of the 335 guys have been reporting better mileage figures because even though their car are more powerful, that power moves the weight of the car easier. "
qbrozen,May 2012," ive gotten as low as 23 (well, ok, was much lower than that during my track days) and as high as 26 in the 135 thus far. "
graphicguy,May 2012," q....not tracking my car, but my mpg has settled in the same range, although im closer to 22mpg in town. probably a low of 20 mpg ate one point, but that included nothing but driving in congested honda traffic.got 30 mpg once on all interstate over easter. but, thats with cruise on 70 and no traffic.usually, im right around 26-27 mpg with interstate driving. who needs a 4 cyl? "
billyperksii,May 2012, people who cannot afford a six. 
stickguy,May 2012," whats going on with this string of replied to names? annoying!anyway, we stopped at the bmw dealer saturday (next building over to the acura dealer where we drove the acura), and there was a nice 128 on the apron out front. medium blue (deep sea blue? something like that) that i had never seen before, with tan interior. must have been relatively base, since the sticker was only 37k! "
dudleyr,May 2012," ""usually, im right around 26-27 mpg with interstate driving. who needs a 4 cyl? ""people who want to get 36-37 mpg.  "
rayainsw,May 2012, wow [ ltoyota of 10 respondees ? ]my i6 turbo is averaging 23.5.- raynot driving for maxumim mpg..... 
nyccarguy,May 2012, deep sea blue is absolutely gorgeous! i averaged 21.3 mpg on my last fill up. 
graphicguy,May 2012," one other thing, the mpg computer in the bmw is really accurate. its usually within + or - .1 mpg of my manual calculations.ray.....i never drive as if im trying to maximize mpg.given the mpg im getting plus the muscle car acceleration my 3 offers, im real happy. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," ive actually noticed that too. the mpg on the trip computer is very accurate. on my former acura, the trip computer was always more generous than my actual mileage (same with my wifes honda). "
nyccarguy,May 2012," is on everybodys mind. im sure most of you guys are the car gurus of your circle of family, friends, co-workers... like i am. we all drive performance oriented vehicles. people used to say: ""wow, that thing must be a rocket"" or ""hows it drive?"" now people are so obsessed with gas prices, the first words out of their mouth are: ""is it good on gas?"" or ""what kind of gas mileage do you get?"" "
sweendogy,May 2012, agree - $4 bux a gallon will do that 
sweendogy,May 2012, 335 m pack for 2011 was that bundled with the performance pack? if not can you add the pp to extoyotaing car thru the dealer / if so cost? 
graphicguy,May 2012," m package is seperate from performance package. one does not include the other. performance package is only available via the dealer. but, ive never asked any independent shop if they could do it. "
graphicguy,May 2012," i have 9k miles on my bmw bmw. through one fall, one winter, and now one spring, i really havent noticed bmw intervene once. and, im constantly flinging my car around in the wet, and none too slow either.i consider that a good thing that i dont notice it.i think i only had sh awd in my previous tl intervene twice. both times it was wet. both times i was pushing the limits.while im still not a fan of rfts, the current ones (continental) are worlds better than the ones on the 06 330i (bridgestone). "
stickguy,May 2012," i think in my volvo, the performance pack upgrade would involve switching to a bigger squirrel for the treadmill. "
qbrozen,May 2012, or trading for the t5 you should have bought in the first place. :p 
stickguy,May 2012," no turbos for the kid. shell be enough of a lead foot most likely when she is soloing (they all are!). so better off in a car where if you want speed, you need to work for it!now, when i replace it with something for myself? different story!the volvo though is not a speed demon, but it does cruise along just fine. "
flightnurse,May 2012," my 2011 im getting 22mpg combined, my 05 im getting 22 combined also. now on the freeway, my 05 gets 29. now remember that the zph car have a close ratio 6 spd tranny and lower read gears. i usually set the cruise at about 75. i havent taken the 2011 on a freeway trip yet, heck i only have 4k miles on it too. "
flightnurse,May 2012," ok so last weekend we test drove two bmw, both 2011, one was new, one was a cpo, the cpo had 7k miles on it. the cpo was fully loaded, the new one mildly optioned. first off, wow, it has been a while since i have had 400+ lbs of torque. i can see having to replace the rear tires often on it. the bmw drives like a typical 3 series, sure footed, solid feel, vault like. the cpo had the sport package, so the rear tires are wider then the fronts. over all very impressive, both car drive well, of course the non sport packaged car road a little smoother, but nothing to deter us from not getting it. over all, very impressive, the mpg is better then my 2011, not too sure if the added price is worth the mpg difference. now on a side note, when we came back from the last test drive there was a couple looking at my 2011 (thinking it was for sale.) it seems the guy been looking for a bmw with the m sport package with a manuel and he cant find one. now if bmw would bring the 3.5l d in the 5 series, then we would have been sold on the car. "
sweendogy,May 2012, 328 m pack with the manual- very select car in sedan form. 
nyccarguy,May 2012," well, after driving 340.6 miles using just over 15.5 gallons of premium i averaged just over 21.9 mpg. this is using the cruise a lot to keep the car at 60 - 65 (feels like its crawling), and shutting the car off at long lights. tomorrow am it will be back to driving the bmw like i only have it for another 28 1/2 months:) "
sweendogy,May 2012, are you the same guy arguing why thr acura should be in this category a few months ago? 
nyccarguy,May 2012," yup, thats me:)the acura was a mighty fine automobile, but my bmw is just on another planet. besides my brief drive in a infiniti (which was very entertaining to say the least), i havent driven anything other ellps lately. its like trying to put trevor hoffman & mhondano rivera in the same category. "
dino001,May 2012," really? i get 23-24 mpg not even trying to hard on my daily commute (65% highway at 60-80 mph, 35% honda). on interstate at 75-85 mph i get 28-29 mpg. even in germany, going 90-100 mph (normal cruise speed there if you dont want to be pushed to trucks lane), i got around 23-24 mpg. it is really amazing how they were able to achieve such high mileage on the highway with that six.the mileage admittedly plummets to 18-19 mpg if i do all-honda driving. this batch you drove must be a lot stop-and-go, if you got that trying so hard. btw, im glad you like deep sea blue. i do to, i got one  actually, it was my third choice. i wanted crimson red, but they discontinued it for 2012 wagons, so they did with montego blue (a little brigther). but when i saw my car on the pedestal in munich, i immediately fell for it and forgot about my first choices. one downside - you can see every dust particle on it . i dont like washing my car this frequently, my previous car were less susceptible to show the dust than this one. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," dont forget my 328xi sedan (awd automatic) is hauling around some extra weight compared to your bmw sports wagon (rwd manual). i think even in dry conditions, my car is sending 5% of its power to the front wheels. my car is only rated at 25 mpg. your wagon also has the sport suspension which lowered ride height helps with better mileage.youve got excellent taste in colors. my wifes (2 car ago) 2007 x3 was montego blue. it was gorgeous. she got tons of compliments on it. it did show every little spec of dust, almost as bad as a black car. every time we see a montego blue x3 or 3 series, she gives me the ""hmmmph"" and ""the look"" because her acura acura was black followed by her honda which is polished metal metallic (the bali blue only came with grey leather on the honda nav).if i were to factory order my car from the factory id most likely get deep sea blue. the crimson red & kia red are nice colors too.with my 328xi, it was a leftover & i was more concerned with options (xenon nav) than colors (as long as it wasnt black). "
graphicguy,May 2012," actually, not to be misleading, but the performance package (bmw) can be set up at the dealer....or, if you order from the factory, it will be delivered with your car already installed.it was like that for the 11s. not sure about the 12s. "
sweendogy,May 2012, poor mhondano 
nyccarguy,May 2012, the great mo rivera will be back. throwing his cutter & breakin bats! 
kyfdx,May 2012, doubtful.. 
flightnurse,May 2012," dino the euro car are geared differently, or was this your personnel car on the euro delivery? when i did the euro del on my 05, the best i got in germany was 18. i was not going to have a opal pass me on the autobahn.. "
flightnurse,May 2012," what does the performance package constoyota of? since the twin turbo 6 in the 6 series and 7 series makes 315hp, will the 3 series w/ pp make the same hp? "
dino001,May 2012," it was euro delivery. my overall mileage over 2k miles or so was 21-22, but highway at 90-100 mph was better. "
sweendogy,May 2012, http://www.insideline.com/bmw/bmw/2011/2011-bmw-bmw-performance-edition-pa- ckage-priced-at-550.htmledmunds answer on the ppother bmw news they are working with the makers of the excel on engines.http://www.insideline.com/bmw/bmw-hyundai-retoyota-in-engine-sharing-talks.html 
sweendogy,May 2012," lookimg at a used 14k mile 2011 335 x manual with all the bells and whtoyotales - car is on a used car lot - car fax suggesd the car was serviced multiple times with tires being mounted 3x times, oil change and a replaced transmission - car was then sent to auction where this dealer picked it up. a transmission replaced at 12k miles is huge flag- thoughts from you guys would be helpful. does bmw warrantee transfer full and complete? "
stickguy,May 2012, run. fast. 
flightnurse,May 2012," yes it does, is this car at a bmw dealer? if not, take the vin # to a local bmw and have them print off the service htoyotaory for you, it will give you the dealers name in which the car was serviced at. you could ask the serving dealer why the tranny was replaced at 12k miles. i find it interesting that a transmission was replaced it could be a fluke since they are not the weak spot of the car. "
flightnurse,May 2012," thanks for the link, however you comment on the webpage makes no sense, why cant you get a pp on a manuel, awd bmw? the article doesnt say it not be had...on a side note, those who bought a bmw, shouldnt be too happy since these are the same hp and torque # as the bmw. "
dino001,May 2012," the difference is bmw has smg, which would make big difference vs. traditional automatic. "
sweendogy,May 2012, yeah my comment was from last nov -ive re-read it since- thanks for pointing it out thouguess i was thinking about those leader ads you liked to mention at the time- got me sideways 
sweendogy,May 2012, not a bmw dealer- just a used car dealer. i called the bmw dealer where the car was bought and serviced - they would not give details as i am not the regtoyotaered owner. 
robbieg,May 2012," so, are we going to replace the cts with the ats when it arrives? just saw the prices. too close to the 3 series for me. the base engine package seems to compete with the acura. rightly or wrongly, if i was buyying a caddy instead of a bmw i want a big discount. to me caddy is closer to acura in price than it is bmw. "
sweendogy,May 2012, i dont know the specifics on the ats and its pricing but i agree some discount needs to apply if they are going to be a real threat to the 3. would love to see what fully optioned out car would be- the maxed out 335 gets to 55k pretty quickly- 
flightnurse,May 2012," ah, i was not aware of this, yes the smg would make a big difference. "
m6user,May 2012," if you dont know the pricing, how could you say some sort of discount needs to apply? :confuse: the v6 with 300+ hp starts at about $42000. now if it is decked out with much of the stuff that is optional on the 328 like leather, etc, etc, etc. it may already be a value proposition. the base starts at about $33000 and only has the 200 hp. this is probably going to be for people that like a small cadillac but dont need all the go-go. again, how decked out ""base"" car will be is the question that hasnt been answered by gm yet. if a 270hp 2.0 ats has enough standard it may still undercut bmw(apples to apples options) so heavy discounting may not be necessary.no real test drives have been done either so if those turn out to be very good and the pricing is right it may be very competitive. since we dont have any idea of the standard equipment that goes along with the different engine price points its kind of silly to be making definitive statements at this point in time.

sweendogy,May 2012, well if both car are equipped the same at the start - and they both are around the same price then bmw would win because well its a bmw- and since caddy saying this is a 3 series fighter they would need more for less. see pontiac5-infiniti- similar performance 10k diff in price. if they were priced the same infiniti would sell fewer car - pretty simple if you ask me.the details for pricing on edmunds - posted today do not include any options or standard features - so we have no real clue on how to compare these car. 
m6user,May 2012," so we have no real clue on how to compare these car. \ummh, that was my point. how can one say the ats would have to be discounted until we do know the details? the base ats may have standard that which you might have to pay thousands for on the 328. i agree, bmw has the pinache and htoyotaory, so if they were very(youre never gonna get exactly) similarly equipped the ats would have to be at a lower price point or be discounted like you toyota. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," as much as id love to have you as part of the bmw ownership brotherhood on our board here, im sure whatever they are asking for that 335xi with the new manual transmission isnt exactly cheap. so id pass on this & keep looking if i were you. "
sweendogy,May 2012, thx you. i have decided to pass- maybe ill look at the ats/  
flightnurse,May 2012," gm needs to get the ats right the first time for it to be competitive in the market it will compete in. it will be interesting to see what happens, it took the cts 5 years before it was close to bmw. i hope for gn sake they do get it right. "
flightnurse,May 2012, walk away from that 335.. 
flightnurse,May 2012," one could say, the ats should be priced lower then the cts, so a base price could be speculated. a base cts is $36k a base bmw starts at $35k, so one could say the ats should start at about 30k or even less. gm at times seems not get the pricing game correct, if they want to sell the ats then they need to get very aggressive on the price, mid level ats should be priced at about $33k make it less then a bmw enough for people to think twice about spending more money on a car then they need to. "
graphicguy,May 2012," dino....granted, ive only driven a 3 with the smg trans once, and it was only on a brief test drive. but, i came to the conclusion bmw smg trans isnt nearly ready for prime time. maybe its something you get used to. but, the one i drove was in a new bmw. it wasnt remotely smooth, nor was it particularly sporty.again, could have been i wasnt used to it. but, i knew it wasnt for me within a minute or two of driving it.flightnurse.....ive heard rumblings on some of the other bmw specific forums when the pp first was announced that the bmw folks got the short end of the stick, considering what they paid to get the ""is"" version. "
flightnurse,May 2012," graphic i drove a bmw with the smg and didnt like it, this was the last generation bmw ( i beleive) and i hoped they have gotten it right, but i guess not. too bad, since porsche,audi and volkswagen sure has. i would consider a new bmw with a smg if it worked as well as volkswagens... "
nyccarguy,May 2012," i know a guy who has been a die hard stick driver his entire life. he had a 997 911 c2 (6 speed manual). he got rear ended at a light and the car was very badly damaged (he was in the hospital for 2 months). the car wasnt damaged enough to be totalled, but he toyota it never drove right after he got it back. he immediately began searching for a new car. his 1st stop was a bmw dealership. he nearly walked out when the salesman toyota they didnt have any 6 speed stick bmw in stock for him to drive. the guy practically begged him to drive the dct equipped bmw. he drove it and absolutely loved it. he ended up buying an bmw convertible with dct. "
stickguy,May 2012," i have not driven a stick since my honda was sold back in february (my volvo is an at, and the other car in the family is a michevroletn). i still occasionally push at the imaginary clutch, or reach to shift gears, but overall have not missed it. just driving around town of course, so no big deal, but did get stuck in nyc traffic on my trip to li!and my dd had been a manual for all but 3 months since i got my first car at age 17, which is many, many, many (sadly, i just had a milestone bday) years ago. "
flightnurse,May 2012," ok boys, hondaing to the detroit freepress the ats will start at $33,990. too high in my book.http://www.freep.com/article/20120508/business01/205080328/cadillac-unveils-ats-- pricing-it-s-the-new-kid-on-the-block-enjoy the reading... "
fedlawman,May 2012," and when is the last time anyone paid msrp for a gm car? when the rebates come (and theyll come quickly), youll be able to buy an ats for $29,500.heres to hoping it isnt ugly... "
fedlawman,May 2012," and if i havent toyota it yet, i think the new car to buy right now is the e90 bmw - while they last. "
flightnurse,May 2012," well when i bought my 2000 vette there were not rebates on it, of course they do sell everyone they make. the size of the car is important, since the ats is smaller then a cts, not too sure how they is going to play out... the 2012 3 series is a bigger car then 2011, the audi is about the same size as the 3, and the c class now has livable back seat. this is going to be interesting. "
sweendogy,May 2012, a similar article was on edmunds earlier in the week- i dont think its the starting price but the options prices and standard features that need to define if its a player -i think we need further details before totally dismissing a non-bmw. the article did point to the fact you can get the bigger eng 6 with some technology for 42k - which in a 3400 lb car could be interesting. 
kyfdx,May 2012," of course they do sell everyone they make. i think thats true of every car model, eventually... "
nyccarguy,May 2012, thank-you for the compliment my friend:) 
fedlawman,May 2012, i had you in mind... i think you made a smart move. 
nyccarguy,May 2012, i know i made the right move:). i enjoy every single mile i drive it. 
fedlawman,May 2012," would you believe that i am even rethinking my position on awd? at least, certain applications of it... "
flightnurse,May 2012," you are correct, however, in the case of the vette, you wont see the past year model linger in the showroom very long. not like other gm models.. "
flightnurse,May 2012," sweeny im not dismissing the car at all, what im saying is, for the ats to be a home run, gm best get it right the first year. since the ats is being billed as a 3 series fighter, they will have a problem to start with, its size. it is smaller then a 3 series, audi and c class. yes, the ats will have the 3.6l di engine but that doesnt mean it will be a good car... "
graphicguy,May 2012," flight....nyc....just goes to show, an opinion is worth what i charge for it  .i didnt like the smg in the bmw. others may like it quite a lot.over the last several years, ive strayed away from manual transmissions. i think the automatics have become so accomplished and efficient, i dont think i can match the performance of a good automatic. the 6-speed auto in my 3 is great. i know i couldnt match the shifts if i were driving it with a manual.....and im pretty good with the left pedal.some car just cry out for a manual....like muscle car.....or a porsche. everything else, a good automatic will net more performance 9 out of 10 times.someone mentioned 3 series diesel car a while back in here. i was in manchester u.k. for business a few weeks ago. my company has a couple of car for those of us visiting to use. i think they lease them as they change every 3-4 years. they put me in a diesel jaguar. not a bad car, at all. they dont understand our (meaning u.s.) affinity for ""petro"" car. but, gas is about $9-$10/gal there. so, diesels are very popular. "
flightnurse,May 2012," graphic when it comes to the argument for and against a manual transmission i would place bmw and vette in the category as must have. growing up i have had only three car that didnt have manual transmission. 65 ford, 57 continental mark ii and a 1970 datsun truck that had a buick v6 in it. however, after driving the volkswagen dsg car, i could live with a good dual clutch transmission car, but bmw has not built one yet. i do see the future going in that direction when it comes to performance car.when it comes to prices in the uk and the eu the price for petrol and fuel (diesel) are about the same, this is why diesels are so popular. btw, it was me who talked about the bmw. "
robbieg,May 2012," i think that regardless of the actual transaction price the ats has to be priced less than bmw if for no other reason than frequently people look online to check out a car. i would think that if they are priced too close together no one would even take a hard look at the ats at which point they might discover the discounts. sometimes the ""discount"" doesnt appear quickly and it turns people off. or in some markets, you have dealers that dont discount as heavily as dealers in other markets. "
sweendogy,May 2012, flight the 328 you ride is it manual or auto? 
markcincinnati,May 2012," i have now reached 15,000 miles on my 2012 acura tl advance sh-awd. i have had two oil changes and at the second change the sh-awd ""fluid"" was changed (very expensive.) the tires have been rotated twice.i keep the tires cold inflated to: front 37, rear 35. i decided to stick with the somewhat crappy oem tires that came with the car, since they are all-season uhps and i wanted to go through winter (very light even for cincinnati) with the oems kind of to allow me to ""testify"" about the oem selection.i added 4 suzuki guards and the backup sensors -- otherwise the thing is bone stock.i bring my own oil -- mobil 1 -- for the changes, and all service has been performed by the dealer, lindsay acura, columbus, oh.this is one boring car from a service perspective. it did, however, seem peppier after the second oil and ""fluid"" change -- in that respect it reminded me somewhat of my experience with audi -- they feel more powerful at 5,000 and again at 10,000 miles.i am not used to paying for service (audi and bmw spoiled me in that regard) -- so $230 oil changes including tire rotations are painful. but in fairness, the reason for the expense on the last one was the sh-awd fluid, which wont be changed again for a long time.this car seems almost freakishly unfazed by miles and time. there are no rattles, no wear and tear (inside or out) tells that could give away the car age (in miles.) most of my german car -- my 2005 audi audi 3.2 audi being the only exception -- have always started to either feel or (upon examination) show their age by this point.the last two bmw developed rattles in a similar time / miles situation. the audi seemed to be a dirt magnet -- and i wash my car twice weekly (including vacuuming the interiors), so it is not due to some change in my auto-hygene regimen that i tell you the acura at 15,000 miles feels totally new, looks new, drives new, etc etc. the only difference is it gets somewhat better mileage now and it has a bit more pep in its step.yet the tl remains a compromise car -- it is ""in the ballpark"" with the germans i have been used to (and by in the ballpark, i mean broadly: features, content, power, price, etc.) but it is about 9/10ths. now considering its value quotient, perhaps it is more than 9/10ths; but, when i push it hard through a curvy back road it makes me think, ""this is soooo close, but just not quite there."" of course my lease payments are $100 per month less than the outgoing 2009 audi 2.0t audi sport and the acura still feels the same as it did (as noted above) the day i got it. the audi, on the other hand, at 15,000 miles had already gone through a set of tires (and very expensive ones at that) and just seemed a bit more worn.i have come to a conclusion, perhaps incorrectly so, that like the hyper expensive tires that came with the audi and pooped out young (they turned to powder in an effort to make the car feel as if it were on rails), perhaps the german car perform better for a shorter period of time. the japanese -- perhaps -- dont perform as well from the get go, but they ""take a lickin and keep on tickin"" with minimal fuss and care.the sales manager of the acura store came from an audi store and he remarked that the germans make the best performing car, period, but that they require the owner to take much more of an active role in maintaining that ultra high performance standard.i have a sheltie -- very low strung, very low maintenance (groomed about every 8 weeks and thats it) -- perhaps the sheltie analogous to a japanese ellps or lps car. now, then, there are some other breeds which seem to be high maintenance, but win a lot more ""best in show"" awards -- perhaps the german car are like a high strung high maintenance dog breed.beats me -- the acura certainly has been superior at one thing, though: not aging. :surprise: "
kyfdx,May 2012, why does markcincinnati get his car serviced in columbus? 
carnaught,May 2012, mark: thanks for the report. happy to hear your acura is not showing the interior wear and rattle problem i had with my previous generation tl and my two other acura. 
nyccarguy,May 2012," 15,000 miles is literally nothing for a honda product (nor should it be for any car at this price point). my 10 year old (146,200 mile) honda is extremely well screwed together. im still on the original shocks.thanks for the 15k report. im glad you are enjoying the car (the 9/10ths of it anyway;) & the $100 per month in your pocket.you are bringing your own oil & still getting a $231 bill for an oil change? your dealer seems to charge an awful lot of money. "
sweendogy,May 2012, ive had a car for 30k and i dont think ive spent 231 bux total on oil changes and i use oil the dealer puts in. 
markcincinnati,May 2012," i bought the car using carwoo.com -- the columbus dealer gave me a 13% off sticker price.i drive to columbus twice weekly, and i am always in columbus on either saturday or sunday. the time between cities is 100 minutes.when the change oil reminder comes on, i call the dealer that i bought the car from and make a saturday appt. i ask for the car i want as a loaner, an acura or zdx, etc and i get to test drive that car for the day whilst the car is being serviced.the $230 oil change was due almost entirely to the fact that at the second oil change the sh-awd fluid has to be changed -- and it is very pricey.while 15,000 may be ""nuthin"" for a honda (which is another reason the acura is only 9/10ths), an audi with 15,000 miles on it is middle aged. i have kept one german car more than 50,000 miles. the german car drive great, perform great, look great and their features and functions are the standard by which the other guys measure themselves (or so i assume.)yet only this car feels new at 15k miles -- the german car seem to begin the aging process by 15k miles.now give me the choice of the acura or the audi and get rid of the price issues, well, at this point i would still go with the german despite my belief that it will age faster than the japanese car. in fact i am starting to believe that an american car will also age more slowly due to the fact that we americans think nothing of making two round trips to columbus ohio from cincinnati per week, whereas a german would take a train for such a dtoyotaance if at all possible (which it almost always is, in germany and most of europe.) another example, i do business in chicago -- 275 miles from cincinnati. i used to fly. now the 5 hour drive to chicago is about identical to the time it takes to make the trip on delta (all things considered.)and i can drive there in an enterprise rental for a fraction of the cost of a plane ticket. these days i am probably putting 18-20k per year on my car because it is more prudent and pragmatic than the currently available alternatives.in any case all of these things seem to support driving car that think 15k miles aint no thang. "
billyperksii,May 2012," mark- just say ""rear differential fluid"" not sh-awd. "
markcincinnati,May 2012, will do -- i was just quoting the dealers lingo. 
jeffm5,May 2012," markcincinnati, i find your posts very well written and informative. i just bought a volvo volvo. it will be a 2013. i will not take delivery until july. my recent car have been toyota and subarus. at 15,000 miles those car still felt like new. in you opinion, will the volvo be showing signs of aging at 15,000 miles like the german car? thanks. "
flightnurse,May 2012, both of my 3 series are manuals. 
nyccarguy,May 2012, flightnurse - thats awesome! 
graphicguy,May 2012," mark.....youll find that your tl wont require much in the way of maintenance at all. i still have a soft spot for the one i had. they really are very good car. what people lament is that they arent the ""outstanding"" car that their acura predecessor was. that doesnt change the fact that tls can stand in their own spotlight.keep us posted on your ongoing experiences.flightnurse....the diesels ive driven have varied from very nice (the jag), to painful (an old mercedes). still, id have a hard time making a case for one in this country....unless, as is true in the u.k., diesel prices = gasoline prices.it seems the u.s. is going with plug-in hybrids or chevrolet type vehicles rather than diesels. i havent heard any hydrogen updates in quite some time. i dont even know if any of the major manufacturers are still developing them. "
flightnurse,May 2012," mark i fully understand why you go back to the same dealer for service, this is what i have done with my 05 330 and the bmw. building the relationship with a dealer makes the whole dealership experience worth while, like you when i take my car in for service, i normally get the loaner i want.want to talk expensive for service, nissan cvt transmission fluid change, my partner has a nissan rouge and at 45k miles service the cvt fliud needs to be changed, $450..... that is just for the fluid, and not the other service items. his 45k mile service was over $500... like you, i am spoiled on bmw free service. "
andys120,May 2012," youre entitled to your opinion but audi and bmw ive owned have barely been ""broken in"" at 60k miles and ive never bought a brand-new one. a well-cared for example can easily break six digits with no major problem. "
flightnurse,May 2012," graphic when you talk ""old"" diesel my father bought a 79 peugeot wagon new and let me tell you, my grandmother could walk faster then that car could go. i had a 86 mb 300sdl (ok i lied i had 5 vehicles that had autos) and was impressed with the power of that car, it was quieter then the peugeot but not as quiet as the volkswagen. now i can only speak for what i have seen, in phoenix the price of diesel is less then premium that we german car owners but in our car. here on island island the price of diesel is roughly 30 cent more then diesel. so getting a diesel wouldnt make sense. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," the shell station i fill up at mostly right off i95 in stamford, ct had 93 octane & diesel at the exact same price. "
flightnurse,May 2012, nyc is that is the case then a diesel would be a better choice... 
flightnurse,May 2012," check this article out, this couple drove 1600 miles on a single tank..http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2012/05/84-mpg-couple-drive- s-volkswagen-volkswagen-diesel-record-chevrolet-chevrolet-/1#.t6vlo-tdn2b "
markcincinnati,May 2012," i couldnt even begin to answer your question. htoyotaorically, volvos live very long lives -- and are expensive to maintain and repair like their german cousins.today, i would expect, any car (virtually any) to make it to 150,000 miles with normal maintenance and a few repairs.now then, the issue is what is the definition of normal maintenance?my wifes last bmw (a 2008) could only have an oil change (that was free) when the car toyota it needed it -- once this was at 19,000 miles. since the car was leased, we changed the oil and did the other things when the book called for it. to me bmw service recommendations arent ""normal,"" since the miles between service intervals seems impossibly long.audi want oil changes every 10k miles -- and there is no computer inside that is determining when the maintenance should really be performed. i would think that would make a used, late model, audi perhaps less prone to the wear that a bmw might have with its very very long service intervals.i repeat, i have no clue how soon it will be -- in miles -- before you will notice your volvo isnt ""new"" anymore. i turned in my 2009 audi 2.0 with just under 55,000 miles on it -- it needed new tires (what would have been its third set) and the sport suspension seemed to be a bit ""worn"" feeling. also it used a quart of oil every 2,000 miles, which seemed excessive, although the dealer told me there was a tsb on it that essentially cured that issue.of our 29 german car, only my 60,000 miles young 2005 audi 3.2 still felt ""young-ish"" after 30,000 miles. the difference in the german car is they drive like no other -- so what you get are car that ""die young and leave a good looking [driving] corpse.""one more time, for the same money, id still take the german car even though i believe it will be breathtakingly expensive to keep young. :surprise: "
flightnurse,May 2012," mark i like reading your post, however, im not getting this ""young feeling"" you talk about. my 05 bmw feels better today with 47k miles on it then it did when i picked it up in germany in 05. when i slide into the 330 the feeling i is like visiting an old friend, everything feels right. i havent gotten that with my 11 yet, since i have less then 4k miles on it. i do know that the german car get better with age and miles. now my 330 i have gone through 5 set of tires, and yes, i have taken it on a couple of track days, but it is the price of driving my bmw to 8/10 when i can. the biggest difference between the japaneses and german car is personality the japaneses car lack personality. they are great appliances.. "
billyperksii,May 2012," the guy owned 29, i think its fair enough to value his opiion. "
flightnurse,May 2012," no one is arguing that, but for he most part, the german car age better then others, that is all im saying. i tend to keep my car longer then mark, and drive them harder, my 05 bmw has no rattles at all, and having about 4k hard track miles on them im impressed with that. "
andys120,May 2012," the difference in the german car is they drive like no other -- so what you get are car that ""die young and leave a good looking [driving] corpse.""tell that to me 12 y/o bmwa with 140k, or my 11 y/o bmwwith 80k, both car get compliments all the time and drive like new. "
jwilliams2,May 2012," the difference in the german car is they drive like no other -- so what you get are car that ""die young and leave a good looking [driving] corpse."" my experience is different....ive always gotten great service and longevity from german car. starting with a 55 volkswagen that i bought some 50 years ago. ive also had an audi, some bmw, and several mercedes. i always keep my car a long time, generally 10-15 years and always go over 100k. my 86 mb 300e went 245k, and i sold it maybe 10 years ago to someone who still drives it. my current mb is 15 years old, and has 136k on it. it is absolutely the best car ive owned, and looks as good and is as tight today as it was when new. none of my car had major problem or cost more than what i consider reasonable to maintain.just something about driving these car that makes them stand out. i cant imagine driving an ""appliance"" car, as i would probably be bored to death. "
carnaught,May 2012," i turned in my 2009 audi 2.0 with just under 55,000 miles on it --................... also it used a quart of oil every 2,000 miles, which seemed excessive, although the dealer told me there was a tsb on it that essentially cured that issue. nupe....my 2011 audi goes through a quart of oil 1500-2000 mi. apart, changed at audi expense (one of the times im happy its leased). "
sweendogy,May 2012," japanese car lake personality- someone in an honda blow you away at some stop light at some point? another small dink at the japanese - im sure your bmw with 47k miles is great and rock solid-but please spare us with the german car age better - ask a mechanic what ages better. i am glad you drive a manual - even thou your comments at times make zero sense ( see november comments on leader ads , and comments saying infiniti infiniti will be new for 2013) save the manuals. "
flightnurse,May 2012," i have read many peoples post regarding the oil usage of the 2.0 turbo 4, i also read there is a tsb on it also. "
dino001,May 2012," well, blowing somebody at lights is not my concern, but if wanted to my previous subarus would do just fine. i also would rather take a car without personality than with a bad one. the aging argument on german car depends on what we are talking about. the chassis, main mechanicals, as long as maintained and not abused are probably fine for long. however, i would not be so sure about electrical system, motors, switches, etc. i think at some point germans could not restoyota replacing $20/50000 hrs with one for $5/8000 hrs (just example, not real numbers) on false calculation of short-term ownership by first owner and they are slowly working back that lapse of judgement. there is also their high maintenance-high complexity culture that has been present for decades (their war machines were like that, too, e.g. panther tank required fully equipped shop to replace transmission and it had to be taken apart - allied/russian tanks could have field tranny replacements; even its staggered wheel pattern made it more difficult to field replace the tracks on the field). every design has it objectives and constraints. at some point, getting closer to objectives (more performance in a car, better performing armored battle vehicle) comes at price of maintenance, complexity, which in turn can adversely affect the primary objectives in long term. in simple words, while working the machine has no equal, but to make it work can be cost prohibitive and even small setback has a potential becoming a major problem. "
dino001,May 2012," as i mentioned, in engineering there is a point of diminishing returns, where gains in primary objectives are being offset by increasing costs, both direct and indirect and unintended effects.i would say the main difference between japanese and german car is germans are willing to test that limit going beyond it and are able then sell the product to willing people, like me. japanese are asking different question, basically at what point it is good enough and not affecting other paralled objectives. that may be defined as lacking soul, but i dont think that is fair. it is matter of different objectives. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," mileage update: last fill up = 19.8 mpgdino - you are right, there are quite a few evenings that i sit in heavy trafficsaw a bp station here in the bronx where super was 4.25/gal & diesel was $4.49/gal "
graphicguy,May 2012," flight....in europe, i can see the appeal of diesel car. here, where the vast majority of the time, diesel fuel is normally sold at a significant premium over gasoline, i cant see it catching on with passenger car.that toyota, i keep meticulous records on my 3. i have every fill-up recorded. im averaging about 22 mpg, overall. lowest i got was 19 mpg. highest was 29 mpg. lowest price for gas i paid over the last year was $3.19/gal, highest was $4.01/gal. thats almost a 30% swing....with no supply disruption, with worldwide demand either flat, or declining. tell me that traders arent manipulating prices.japan vs german.....well, i think my former tl was built as well as anything i ever owned from germany (essentially, 3 bmw). that toyota, the cts coupe i test drove was as solid as anything ive ever driven.i had heard that the audi were oil hogs, from more than one person. but, sounds like they may have a ""fix"" in the works for that.my 2nd choice over my bmw coupe was either an s4 or an audi. at least locally, none of the ones they had in stock appealed to me. the two local dealers had all of 2 s4s in stock, and acted like they were made of platinum, or convertible audi (again, i wanted a coupe).so, neither got into my check book. "
flightnurse,May 2012," sweeny im not the one looking for a bmw bmw w/ sport package and manual that would be you, if the mighty g is all that and more why would you give up a wonderful car with only 30k miles on it?btw, i do not race on the street, i leave that to the track. my opinion is that japaneses 4 dr car have no personality when driven hard. this includes the might infiniti g and m, lexus is, and the new gs. for me they feel like an appliance. im not saying i am correct, but this is my opinion. "
flightnurse,May 2012," graphic for about 4 yrs i kept track of my mileage and how many gallons i used, but that stopped. i do however, have all my receipts for everything ever done to the car, tires, brakes, suspension upgrades, exhaust, black box re-flash, etc... i even have the original german plates from when i pick it up. the audi audi, excellent car, if i was going to get a audi it would be audi or the audi.

sweendogy,May 2012," now your talking- thanks just wanted a little clarity on your statement- we now understand why they have no personality - fair comment.for me i have a couple of reasons why i would love a 335 x drive or an audi s4. 1) they would have a warrantee- my car is no longer under the infiniti umbrella. sure its only been driven by me, is in great shape but those tiny little gremlins in the dash could strike any day.2) stick shift, save the manuals - i for one think the modern manuals are better then automatics,why? well they make you become more engaged with the car and more aware of the other drivers- you are constantly monitoring speed- making sure you are in the right gear to pass- or to slow. i think its a better way to drive period. i know 95% drive autos- but to me they are not driving - they are being driven. you can talk about dct, automanual, cvts- sorry they dont do it for me. volkswagen tdi article that flight mentioned about a couple that got 80mpg is a good read- best part about it? it was done with a manual transmission "
markcincinnati,May 2012," there are plenty of resources -- both subjective and objective -- that discuss the german car personalities or that decry the japanese for making appliances.all the ""did too"" ""did not"" that we may throw out here can also be additional data points -- there are so many of us were not just relying on anecdotes, that is.virtually all car have improved in reliability and durability -- but for whatever reason the japanese car (regardless of where they really come from) certainly seem to win the durability sweepstakes while the german car typically win the fun to drive contest but pretty regularly are written about as being less durable.my rattle free tl or my wifes rattle prone bmw certainly cant be assumed to represent all acura or bmw and certainly shouldnt be assumed to represent anything other than themselves.the surveys that are availble, however, regularly and frequently conclude that a japanese car family (fill in the blank) will often far outlive a ""similar"" german car family (also fill in the blank) insofar as durability is concerned. and of course there is the matter of the expense of keeping any car beyond a certain point.one of the folks i work with has a 13 year old lexus and a 10 year old bmw -- both with well over 100k miles on the odometer. both car are paid for -- yet the bmw is often being driven in so that it could get the latest $1,100 repair or replacement part -- never has the lexus required such an outlay, hondaing to my buddy.on the other hand, another co-workers bmw required new rotors and pads at 50,100 miles and his service cost almost the day out of warranty was over $1,800.now i wouldnt say the bmw was non durable due to the service costs the day the warranty died -- it just seems odd that would happen so young. the japanese car, have earned a reputation for long long lives -- we, here, are not the cause of such reputations, but perhaps there is something to it.the european car -- germans in particular -- do not enjoy such reputations, no matter what we argue here. :surprise: "

nyccarguy,May 2012," my wife got a flat on thursday in her honda. i dropped the honda off at the tire shop thursday night, which means she gets my 328xi for the day on friday, & ive got to drive the honda to work (cue the violins, we should all have such problem). jumping back into the bmw this am, i immediately noticed how much it weighs compared to my (3042 lb) honda.toyotamically, like ive toyota my 3 blows my former acura out of the water. my acura stereo gets major points as compared to the base stereo in my 328xi.

flightnurse,May 2012," when i read the post i figured it was a typical post to stir up the pot, it wasnt worth it. "
sweendogy,May 2012, i like when people stir the pot- why do you think this is edmunds most popular forum ? 
graphicguy,May 2012," so, i know this has turned into something of a bmw love fest. but, i have to admit that the paint on mine is outstanding. i detailed it saturday (once/spring, once/fall). not one chip....even after a year of driving it. still looks great, too (black metallic). impressive! "
andys120,May 2012," still looks great, too (black metallic). impressive! take care of it and that paint will look great for years to come. my 2001 bmw is black (sapphire) metallic and still gets compliments after 11 years and 80,000 miles.  "
sweendogy,May 2012," i would hope it would look outstanding, its a year old- dont know how impressive that is but congrats on no chips-and its a bmw lovefest for sure- people love everything about, only thing people question is price- see new guys post - oh wait that was deleted. "
qbrozen,May 2012, mine is that black metallic/sapphire but doesnt look so great after 3.5 years and 48k miles. plenty of stone chips and a few scratches. the po wasnt nearly as caring as you. :sick: 
kyfdx,May 2012," yeah... i think the previous owner of my 06 model lived near a subaru pit... he had touched up the chips with the wrong color red... i had a body shop clean them up and re-touch up with the correct color.... still... not that great..other than that, the paint looks fantastic.. (so, squint and only look towards the rear.... of the car) "

nyccarguy,May 2012," speaking of bmw love. my wife had a training day for work so i took the day off to watch my kids (good thing my dad is my boss). so by default, i got the honda for the day. my wife took my 3. at dinner tonight she asks: ""so do you want to take the honda to work tomorrow?"". me: ""so you like my car then? ill let you take it once a week. i havent driven it since saturdsy, so im taking it tomorrow.

graphicguy,May 2012," nyc....i have used zaino for years. im thinking its time to get an orbital buffer, even though the zaino is easy on and off.how do you like that griot unit? is it the big one or small one?andys....i do take care of my car, in and out. q...is your a midwest car? "
nyccarguy,May 2012," i have the bigger (6""?) griots random orbital. it does not swirl. i have a pic on my phone of my former (black) acura hood after i waxed it with the orbital. you can see the clouds reflecting from the sky clear as day. all the griots products ive ever used work as advertised.

andys120,May 2012," q...is your a midwest car? nope, my bmw is an arizona car. the ultraviolet can really play havoc with paint out there. i cant take credit for the condition of the paint since i just bought the car this winter.ill take the credit for the great paint on my e39 bmwa which i keep in nh. ive had it for 8 yrs and the steel blue on it is in great shape thanks to frequent detailing and regular waxing. despite living on a dirt road, there are hardly any chips.

billyperksii,May 2012," graphic, iam die hard zaino user and i dont think that i will ever use another product. the orbital you mentioned, is it just for applying and removing the polish? i have seen the products you use adverised in car and driver but was not really intrested because the zaino polymers are just in a class by themselves.

graphicguy,May 2012," nyc.... shoot an email to me at my edmunds user name at yahoo.billy.....ive kind of settled in with zainos aio product. i used to do all the mixing of additives, using different zaino products. now, i get a really good shine, and really good protection using their ""all-ihonda"" product. one coat usually gets me about 6 months of ""beading"". bmw paint responds really well to it, too (black sapphire metallic).q...in all fairness, my vehicles are garaged. so, i think that adds a lot in keeping the finishes in better shape. that toyota, i think this is the first car ive owned where the paint doesnt show one ding, one chip, one scratch....after a year. this bodes well (not like i keep any car long enough for the finish to get worn to begin with :shades: ).

rayainsw,May 2012," i have been out of [ internet ] touch for a week and a half, or so. in scanning through recent posts, i have seen reference to the bmw bmw [ i am at 8,000+ miles on a lease - a 2011 coupe with dct ] and references to the smg trans.i drove an bmw w/smg trans. once. several years ago. not smooth, i agree. the dct, i find to be incredibly smooth under almost every driving circumstance, amazingly quick in up & down shifting &#150; and for me, it works extremely well with the tq of the &#145;overboosted&#146; n54.i chose the bmw for several reasons. and i am quite happy with my choice. compared with the bmw performance power kit for the n54 engines, the bmw overboost provides 370 tq, for long enough to get into a heap of trouble. the ppk offers 317 tq w/dct. [ below quote from bmw. ] the dct was not available in the &#145;regular&#146; bmw. the stock performance exhaust on the &#145;is&#146; is a nearly perfect compromise [ for me ] between interesting and obnoxious volume &#150; and i find the sound at wot to be absolutely intoxicating. oh, and i really liked the style of the 18&#148; wheels on the &#145;is&#146;. [ style 313 ]- rayfwiwtorque is increased to 332 lb-ft (when equipped with an automatic transmission) and 317 lb-ft (when equipped with a manual or dct transmission). "
nyccarguy,May 2012, ill have a chance to sample it later this summer or early fall. a friend of mine has a new bmw on order (with the dct) & ive already been promised a test drive;) 
rwoller,May 2012," i love my active cruise control on my 2006 series 3. i was thinking about buying a new e30 version, but there is no active cruise. does anyone know what happened to it? is it available in europe? is it in the cards for the future.if this is in the wrong section, im sorry. i couldnt find how to create a new section.raymond "
sweendogy,May 2012," ray right section- nothing but bmw experts here, ex me- answer being researched right now by one of them - would also point out infiniti has this as part of a tech pack - plus there are 3k deals off car right now from the manufacture - "
flightnurse,May 2012," raymond the active cruise was offered on the e30, it will be offered on the f30 not until july. . "
flightnurse,May 2012," excellent, i hope that bmw got the dct right this time!!! of course it was called smg in the past... "
andys120,May 2012," my understanding is that the dct is a true twin-clutch set-up whereas the smg was a kind of bastardized auto-clutch hybrid of an automatic shift and a manual.there was no adaptive cruise con on the e30 (1982-93), perhaps you mean the f10 (current 5 series). "
sweendogy,May 2012," smg, dct, rmv - all take a backseat to a short throw manual. if you are buying an bmw or a 335 or a 335s or a s4/5 or a volkswagen for that matter and dont spin your own gears - why bother. here come the arguments about how far theyve come- better mpgs, faster to 60- sorry. if the car has a sweet manual available - its the only way to go. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," ill be the 1st (of many here on the board) to agree with you that theres nothing like ripping through the gears of a slick shifting manual transmission with the engine screaming towards its 7400 rpm redline (like in my honda).the traditional automatics have gotten better than the old 4 speed slushboxes of the 80s & 90s. they are just as fast & get better fuel economy. the double clutch auto manuals (dsg, dct, pdk) will shift faster than any human can around a race track.my biggest reason for buying my bmw in an automatic (besides the fact it was a leftover) is because it is easier. easier when my wife has to take my car 1 - 2 x per week. easier when im literally crawling in traffic on a thurs or friday afternoon on the cross bronx, the merritt, or conn turnpike (i 95). "
dino001,May 2012," i take another position - as long as any car that i may want can be had with manual, i will take nothing else. once it is not, i may look around. i dont care about ""deals"", waiting 3 months on the order, or what not. going to germany is only an icing on the cake for me, even if after flying back i had to wait almost two months to get it back (well, i chose to pick it up in the performance center, so they had to get me another time slot there, which probably extended the wait time by anothe couple of weeks).i understand i may need to pay more (dealer may be less inclined to discount a car thats not on his lot), especially if i also want unpopular body type (like that wagon - you wont believe how many people look at that and say ""i didnt even know they make them...""), or feature combination. i simply dont care - to me saving two or three grand on car that i dont really want, is not real saving. if im about to drop 45 grand (give or take), it has to have everything i want and nothing i dont, be in right color, etc. couple of thousands less would make me feel better for just about a week - then i start picking it apart in my mind, which will inevitably lead to premature trade. it pretty much happened with sti - except it was planned. the car was a great deal (30 grand plus taxes on $36.5k sticker plus 0% interest), but because it was a compromise (in my mind anyway), i knew the moment i bought it that it was a transitional car (transition to my current 328). it was ok so no torture driving it, but there were some aspects i didnt care for. financially it turned out to be a deal of a buick: i sold it three years later for $22.8k three years later, which turns into less than 300/month depreciation, including full tax (i did not trade the car in). i know i wont get such depreciation on my wagon, but i simply could not wait to get it. in contrast to the sti, with my current 328, i can see trading it early (less than 5 years) only because it turned to be a money pit (some early failures raising red flags), or new offerings get me excited over the top (e.g. they come with bmw gt in bmw variety with manual tranny) and i have some new money lying around i dont know about. btw, im not so easy to excite when it comes to spending money.they just showed pictures new bmw touring (wagon). very nice outside - maybe even better looking. but id rather stay with my six-in-line. i love that engine, every day, every minute. doesnt matter it is not superfast, it just feels right. they can keep that four-cyl turbo for now.  "
qbrozen,May 2012,  if you are buying an bmw or a 335 or a 335s or a s4/5 or a volkswagen for that matter and dont spin your own gears - why bother. i dont understand the question. why bother with what? driving a car? :confuse: 
graphicguy,May 2012," fastest car ive ever driven was a lingenfelter chevrolet z06. it had an automatic and would embarrass just about anything else on the road. and no, it wasnt mine. the trans snapped off shifts faster than any human could do. acceleration was brutal and instantaneous, no matter where the throttle was, or what speed i was going (backed off at 137 mph). "
sweendogy,May 2012, why bother getting a performance car- stick to lexus es 
qbrozen,May 2012," thats just silly. so, in essence, you are stating that all performance car have or should have manual transmissions. im sure ferrari, lambo, and f1 teams, among others, would disagree with you.as you stated, the new transmissions are faster than manuals... so they are more performance oriented. i could argue, why buy a performance car if you are only going to hinder it with a slower manual?of course, i wont say that because i am a true enthusiast who appreciates capable car in all configurations. "
kyfdx,May 2012," that straight-line acceleration just isnt that important to me... i mean, all things being equal, ill take more power... but, that isnt a major part of my choice..my wifes infiniti infiniti will blow my doors off in a straight line.. 327 hp.. it is stupid fast... but, it is a bloated truck compared to my car... i wouldnt trade even up, if i had to drive it every day (and, its worth twice the value of mine). "
flightnurse,May 2012," i wonder how much longer manuals will be offered, with the way technology has advanced in the last 10 yrs, the dsgs of today that offer 6,7 and 8 speeds and that can fire off shifts faster then sweeny can start a flame war. one thing i like about the volkswagen dsg was, you could select any gear you want, but ifthe rpms were too high, the transmission wouldnt shift to that gear until the revs were in the correct shift point, a nice feature when coming into a corner and you want both hands on the wheel and motoring out of the corner without problem.for me, if the bmw dct is as good as what people are saying, i wouldnt mind taking a loot at it on my next bmw (if it is offered.)but of course, it is a personnel preference i use to breath manual transmissions only, but as im getting older, i like todays dsg and dct transmissions. "
sweendogy,May 2012," silly - like bringing labo and ferrari into this connissantion? just because they are faster, does not mean they are performance oriented. this idea that autos are better is one of choice, sometimes laziness. 95% of new car here in th states are autos - does that make them better? the acura is a perfect example of a car that equipped with a manual becomes a totally different car then the honda underpins would suggest.true enthusiasts choose manuals ( more often). let me know when you get the lamborghini and i will try out the dct. "
graphicguy,May 2012," kyfdx....i understand what youre saying, but that vette was something that i had never experienced before. now, if i were looking for something to go drive through the appalachians, that wouldnt have been my first choice. but, if i had to choose a car to get from cincinnati to chicago as quick as i could? that would have been my very first choice.like you, for my daily driver, i want a fast car, that handles and rides well, regardless of road. thats why i buy what i buy. im sure same goes for you.gf, on the other hand, loves driving my ford (which is a nice little handling car in its own right) and her avalanche. she just acquired a nice little subaru subaru, too. "
qbrozen,May 2012," just because they are faster, does not mean they are performance oriented.yeah... youre right. what was i thinking saying ferrari and lambo are performance oriented. :lemon:the acura is a perfect example of a car that equipped with a manual becomes a totally different car then the honda underpins would suggest.i agree. and thats because the slushbox attached to it sucks.this idea that autos are better is one of choice, sometimes laziness. 95% of new car here in th states are autos - does that make them better? i never once toyota it was better. let me know when you get the lamborghini and i will try out the dct. go down to the store and try one out for yourself. probably easier to try the pdk out at the porsche store, though. make sure you get one with the sport chrono pack. "
qbrozen,May 2012,"  i use to breathe manual transmissions only, but as im getting older, i like todays dsg and dct transmissionsim with you. although i dont want to say its due to age. partly, i blame my non-manual-driving wife. but i do also like the performance advantage. it is the same reason i chose the 1 over the 3 ... to lose the weight. the 3 would have been way more toyotaable and sensible, but i wanted all the bang for my buck i could get out of that n54 engine. "
dino001,May 2012," i actually have no problem with autos or auto-like transmissions on those 400hp+ supersport car. that makes sense, as true manual may burn through clutch in alarming rate and and it may be just too hard to drive even for more skilled drivers. it starts making sense to replace human foot with computer-actuated shaft to simply make use of all those horses. if its good enough for sebastian vettel, it probably would be good enough for me  - if i could ever afford it, which i wont. however, if we are talking entry-level performance car with 250-350 hp, especially on lower end of that range, i think id not get an auto, if manual were available - and i would look for manual availability in original selection process, i.e. lexus is350, mb c350 are out, infiniti infiniti, bmw 335 are in (and so on) unless there is something really special about those former ones (which my understending is, there isnt). "
Kirstie_H,May 2012," i laugh in the face of any accusation that failing to choose manual transmission is due to laziness, as its usually made by those who use dishwashers, clothes washers, dont change their own oil, etc. - all decisions that are generally made on the basis of effort:benefit ratio, commonly known as ""efficiency."" "
sweendogy,May 2012," the older arguement is very valid, part of the reason why autos will eventually be the only option as older people not teaching youth how to drive stick, sad day. im not that old, flightnurse knows my age, this is not a good trend as manual transmissions engage the driver - cell phones, nav systems alot easier to use with the right hand free to play. if you think your a better driver because your car shift itself to 60 quicker then a manual would, you are wrong. "
m6user,May 2012," if you think your a better driver because your car shift itself to 60 quicker then a manual would, you are wrong.and if you think you are a better driver just because you drive a stick...you are also wrong.being a good driver has nothing to do with driving a stick or not. i know people that drive sticks and they still manage to do all sorts of other things with their hands which probably makes them even more dangerous on the road. i also know drivers that drive automatics that keep both hands on the road and dont ""ecommute"" so to speak so that may make them better drivers. we really dont know who is the better driver based on the type of transmission they use. theres a lot of yahoos out there driving sticks that may think they are good drivers but are really just accidents waiting to happen. of course, that goes for those that drive autos too.  "
qbrozen,May 2012,"  if you think your a better driver because your car shift itself to 60 quicker then a manual would, you are wrong. ummm... i dont. i also dont think im a muskrat ... which has about as much relation to what ive toyota so far as the statement you just made. :confuse:btw, in case you dont realize, and just to point out, i have 3 car currently, and only 1 is an auto. the other 2 are sticks because that was the better performing option on those particular vehicles.the older arguement is very validof course it is. i never toyota otherwise. do you read my posts at all? or are we speaking different languages and im just not aware of it? "
graphicguy,May 2012," bmwuser.....you and kirstie make valid points.a humorous story, my best friend ordered and took delivery of a brand spanking new, manual transmission chevrolet convertible a couple of years ago. he drove it straight from the dealership to my house to show it to me.he had the top down, stereo cranked (i could hear it from the 2nd floor of my house). i went outside to see him sitting in the drivers seat beckoning for me to ""hop in"". i did just that. he gave the throttle a couple of blips, then let out the clutch. you know where this is going. he stalled it dead. i told him he better let me drive..... :p another....this happened to me last fall. why people think they need to race bmw is beyond me. but, some do.stopped at a red light on a 4 lane. guy pulls up next to me in a 350z.....arrest me red. he blips the throttle a couple of times, letting me know he was gonna, by golly race me stop light to stop light.light turns green. i pull away....no z. i look in the rearview.....he stalled it.last one.....this is when i had my tl sh awd. i was driving the backroads near amish country. there are great drivers roads there (must be careful of horse drawn toyotaages).this time it was a g that wanted to prove their prowess. long and short if this, he and i went back and forth, one in front of the other at different times. until, mr g must have hit 4th instead of 2nd, bogged down and stalled. he became a picture in my rear view.everybody has those stories, however. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," you make some excellent point (as you always do) about not compromising for whatever amount of money you choose to spend on whatever car. you buy your car for you and only you. thats the way to do it!i would have been more selective of colors/options/transmission choices, ect if i didnt have my honda. i also truly would not have been able to afford such a nice bmw had it not been for the insane incentives. right now ive got the best of both worlds. i get my stick fix in when i want (sat work commuter) & a more than capable (powered by a truly amazing inline 6) awesome commuter car for that i wont own out of the warranty period for every other day of the year. im not entirely sure whats going to happen when my lease is up. kyfdx convinced me not to buy the car out after the lease is up (hes a very bright, sensible guy & is a host afterall:) i dont think im going to like the new turbo 4 & electric power steering (part of what i hated about my acura) on the f30 bmw. it is going to be a more expensive car to buy (higher msrp when similarly equipped), i wont be able to buy it (or lease it) for the same amount unless i severly cut down some of the options, which would be a huge compromise im not willing to make.i could lease something much cheaper (for commuting purposes) and put extra money to paying off my honda before its finance contracts maturity date 4 years from tomorrow (it is a year old today). ive also got a mortgage & 3 kids to raise (and send through college). ive got my no compromises honda.i love the idea of doing ed, but it just doesnt work for me. i work 6 days a week & have 3 kids. my only vacation is the last 2 weeks of july every summer. "
sweendogy,May 2012, no need for the overbearing tone. stick shift you drive the car- auto the car drives you. 
dino001,May 2012," there may be reasons not buy your car up at the end of the lease, but im not sure, if i would rule that out outright just yet. if the car gives you no trouble over next three years, you like it a lot (so far you do) and whats out there isnt so great, the buyout price should not bother you. here is why: you should look at it from overall six (or so) year cost perspective, not just price at the buyout. you say you got some insane deal, which suggests you got both a good purchase price at the lease beginning, low money factor, and high residual. so you would be giving back some of that inflated residual - in a sense youd defer the initial purchase (which was at low price, i remind you and finance charges were not very high up to this point). so say, you leased for three years and you have to buy reminder of 50-55% of msrp (is that the residual?). granted, its a lot vs. real value, which may be more in 45%- area - but is it really? if you define your residual vs. trade-in value, it may be even less, but you have the advantage - you know the car. moreover, youd never be able to buy same car on the market for that much, dealers would mark them up and other owners would also want more than the dealers are offering. moreover, you havent paid much up to this point and you had a good initial discount. to get the total nominal cost (does not include other aspects of the ownership), add all the lease payments and initial downpayments, taxes and such, buyout purchase price and say 3.5%-4% loan for 36 months (can you do 24 months? - would be better...). if the total is still within reason vs. original car price and you like the car (and it has no problem so far), and there is still nothing else around youd equally like, why not do it? the alternative is you some hum-drum commuter on a lease that youll dread every day you sit in it and every day youll be thinking ""why, oh why i didnt take the bimmer""? "
dino001,May 2012," you buy your car for you and only you. thats the way to do it! exactly right - i remember i had several discussions with people, to whom i had to explain that concept. they all cited low depreciation as a main reason of them getting some car, to which i would always say - i buy a car for me, not the next guy. of course, it has its limits, e.g. if i had two otherwise equal (or at least very close) choices then i would look into depreciation. also, if some vehicle has abnormally high depreciation, it is a good indication of possible troubles with quality - not always, but quite reasonably inferred. however, i never really had a problem with high depreciation car so far - those did not appeal to me, anyway. it just happens that my latest choices, i.e. subaru, bmw have been close to top of the charts in their respective classes, but i did not chose those brands for that reason. when i buy it, i assume it will be ""forever"", even if it is not realtoyotaic. so far it served me well. will see, if the streak continues... "
graphicguy,May 2012," dinoo.....i know test driving an is250 right after test driving an is350 was such a big let down, theres no way i would have been happy with the 250. same went for driving a ""non"" sh awd tech tl vs a standard tl. i knew i wouldnt have been happy with the standard tl.im also in agreement that if youre spending 10s of thousands of dollars for a new car, get what you want. dont settle for a color you may not want, or for cloth if you want leather.i know i probably spent the better of two months looking for my bmw. there were plenty around. but, they were either the wrong external color, or the wrong internal color, or the wrong options, etc. i wanted what i wanted. it took two dealers, two months to find the only one in the country i wanted. both had to get it from the delivery dock and route it to their dealership. only one was able to do that. they got my business. "
dino001,May 2012," way to go, graphic.  "
qbrozen,May 2012," stick shift you drive the car- auto the car drives you.you obviously havent driven these new-fangled transmissions. you tell it when to shift, just like a manual. the only difference is that you dont step on a pedal to do it.overbearing? :confuse: i wasnt the one who stated all people without a 3rd pedal should be driving toyota/ess. i havent made any disparaging or confrontational remarks, but i cant say the same of you. "
sweendogy,May 2012," so your saying the new fringed transmissions - when in auto mode tell you when to shift? beginning this agreement (do you read all my posts?) i agree there are advantages to driving an auto- but in auto mode the driver is not as engaged as one would be in manual transmission- pretty simple agreement. my belief is and will be if you choose a performance car (non lamborghini) for your sporty car - it should come with a manual- if you drive 40 miles on the merritt during rush hour i cant argue the benefits of an auto, but then again you are prob looking at not just a performance car for this task.overbearing - for sure - btw the new es is here - new auto transmission you should check it out.save the manualshttp://www.caranddriver.com/features/save-the-manuals-official-headquarters "
flightnurse,May 2012," sweeny so a porsche 911 turbo with the pdk 8 spd is not a performance orientated car? or a boxster s ? btw, when this discussion was started i dont remember you saying it had to a ellp, you made a blanketed statement and people are proving that manual do not make the car. if this was the case then one could say that a volkswagen volkswagen with a 6 spd manual is performance orientated car. not "
flightnurse,May 2012," dino this is a personnel choice, there is no right or wrong choice here, this is the problem some people have. i would love to see how a pontiac5 manual and a volkswagen volkswagen with a dsg would pan out on the race track... would be an interesting match up. "
flightnurse,May 2012," sweeny is just string the pot like he always does, we all know that f1 car are not manual anymore, if a stick was better then all race car would have them, they do not. period... "
sweendogy,May 2012, figured you would jump in with another great post - one that shines no light and adds zero value- so we enter the flight zone-btw this is an ellps board right. who mentioned a volkswagen? i did say volkswagen. re- read my first post on the matter- or read it again for the first time. http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/direct/view/.ef0audi92/13977#msg13977 
flightnurse,May 2012," sweeny your argument has some weak spots, first it is ok to have a auto is you have a 40 mile commute on the merrit,so why not have the best of both worlds, the dsg/dct give the commuter the auto they need when commuting to work and the manual when they play on the track.sweeny when was the last time you took your g on the track? so have you drive it like 99% of people in america, to and from work and to run errands? are you the type that will play ricky racer from stop light to stop light? "
sweendogy,May 2012," part 2 of the flight zone: you read my original post yet? fully this time- whos talking about the track? i never mentioned tracking at all - stay on point. i do understand people getting autos for the simple reason of being in traffic for a large portion of a car use. comment above about f1, while they do use a semi-auto gears - key term is semi....... (wiki) automatic gearboxes, and systems such as launch control and traction control, are illegal, to keep driver skill important in controlling the car- they want to keeep the driver engaged at all times, basically my original point from the post i linked to you.staying in the flight zone--to answer your questions- have i tracked my g- no. do i drive it to work and run errands, no i have my butler jeeves run my errands - and since my ipo going public tommorrow i will not work again. do i blast from stop light to stop light, only when i see 45k bmw 328s (with autos) sitting across from me. sometimes i race these 328s for pink slips, i have a few for sale sitting in my garage.ive done various schools- from skip barber to team oneil - 8 different times on all types of tracks, on pavement, dirt and snow- not one of the car i drove - from bmw to subi to mazda 3 to chevrolet was an auto or dct or whatever the auto lovers call the computer that changes gears. "
markcincinnati,May 2012," you have made one probable misstatement in your post -- typically a car that is ordered and awaited for months can be discounted more than one that is already on the lot due to the costs associated with what are called holding costs.car that are ordered should be cheaper and will be exactly what you want. i find it amazing, confusing and, frankly, disappointing that dealers stock any car other than what can be used for test drives.on the other hand, i realize the near suicide this suggests for american car dealers. i was literally unable to order a car, the car, as i wanted it. the dealer gave me a 24 hour deal -- 87% of sticker on the only one that he had that was equipped as i wanted it, just not in the color combo i wanted.i have no idea how they did the deal, 13% is huge -- yes?i took the car, off the lot, with the worst interior color imagined by a human: black.and now i must apologize to those who think a black interior is a good thing -- despite the fact that it makes the car seem so much smaller inside, so drab and confining. anyway, typically (especially for european car) buying by ordering will get the best price. "
flightnurse,May 2012," sweeny i fully understand that to make you feel better about yourself you have to make other feel worse about themselves.when this whole talk about auto (dct/dsg) vs stick there was no talk that the car had to a ellp. when other talked about lambos and ferraris you dismissed them. doesnt matter what forum we are in, when you make a blanketed statement that only true performance car have a stick, this allowed people to bring in other car to show you were wrong. "
markcincinnati,May 2012," i am hondad at seeing yet another series of posts lauding stick shifts, suggesting or even outright saying that if you were driving a stick shift that everything would be better., there is no stick shifts are great fun, of that there is no doubt. i guess manual transmissions are also more economical and -- in some cases -- quicker.an argument can be made that you are a better driver if you drive a stick. likewise it can be argued that you can be make your car perform better if it has a stick-shift.but the reality is that most americans have no interest in stick shifts, hence the difficulties in finding them, unless your order one.stick shift car are, practically, not technically speaking, dead. even in europe they are dying.an 8-speed automatic european car is pretty nice to drive -- as is a 7 speed japanese car. even some six speed autotrans are good these days.ultimately, no one will offer a stick shift -- due to lack of interest from the market.no car maker -- like bmw -- will offer a car with only a manual transmission (other than their top of the line which will remain automatic) due to customer acceptance.live with it, i say.i ordered my last stick shift in 2003, knowing the direction would be more autos and few stick shifts as every day passes.where we are today is not the worst place we could imagine -- and frankly i wish we all drove automatics -- oh wait, were almost there already. "
dino001,May 2012," you are right and wrong at the same time. it is a matter of psychology. one one hand, it is true that car ordered should be cheaper as dealer will not bear storage costs. on the other hand, many dealers, especially those in smaller markets are seeing special orders as opportunities to play classic ""hard to get"" game - they see you as already committed, so why bother to be aggressive with pricing. this is especially true on euro delivery on bmw - dealers around my place dont even want to hear about discounting those. of course, a threat to get it in place hundreds of miles away may work, but you must be ready to make good on it. i saw that playing so many times that it is not even funny. there are also other factors, like monetary incentives to move current inventory, no holdback on some brands (iirc bmw, audi), allotments and general ""instant gratification"" culture. at least german brand dealers are used to people ordering, but in many other places you see those deer in headlights faces, when you mention special combination and order in places like toyota or honda dealership. but even there it may not go as smoothly - last year i made an order on 2011 and it did not go through, cause they already closed the allotments on production. lucky i got one a few months later.so many people would really have a hard time to understand why i would wait three months for a car, i had to explain myseld. the instant purchase is quite untoyotaue to american market - in many other countries people exactly order and wait a few months and think nothing of it, but here the market is better equipped to handle guy taking the blue one from bay 25 than one picking options from the catalogue. so, there is a difference between what should/could be and what really is in practice. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," again dino001 you bring up some excellent points. ""like it a lot"" is an understatement. ive proclaimed my love for my 328xi over and over. i got an excellent selling price (over $5400 off the $44k sticker), a low money factor (although not as low as the 0.9% apr for 60 months they were offering), and a high residual (64% for 15k per year plus 10,000 miles extra) of $26,406. i paid only a $795 bank fee, $350 for new ct plates, $72 1st months pmt, a $12.50 ny tire fee, & taxes on these fees. i made a $0 cap cost reduction & didnt pay a security deposit. at the end of my 2 1/2 year lease, my car will have 50,000 miles. will the car last longer? absolutely. i have no doubt that the inline 6 motor and the e90 chassis each in their last year of a model run will be close to bulletproof. yes i will know the car. i know there are literally thousands of similar 328xis that will flood the market in late summer/early fall 2014. private owners always think their car is worth more than it is & dealers charge insane amounts for loaded up, low mileage, creampuffs. my parents each had 2 modern era bmw (dad - 04 x5 & 07 x5, mom - 05 530i & 08 328xi) that both held up very well for between 10 & 30k past their respective warranties. even my wifes former 07 x3 was only at the dealer for scheduled maintenance for the 3 years/ 45k we had it.if i wanted to buy the car out at a nice discount at the end of the lease, i would wantr to pay cash for it. im not so keen on the idea of taking out a loan on a used car with 50k miles thats going to need tires and a whole slew of maintenance (i might go for the extended maintenance pkg).time will tell & we shall see. "
fedlawman,May 2012," if you can bring your car someplace with room to play, a stick shift can add fun to driving. and although having an automatic transmission on a twtoyotay mountain road might dilute some of the fun, i dont think it is fair to say that the mt is some kind of requirement for enjoying a sporty car.because in this segment, there are many things that dilute the fun of driving, of which the auto transmission is only one.if one is serious about enthusiast driving, then one will not buy a car that is needlessly saddled with hundreds of pounds of sound-deadening material, power/luxury items, and computer-controlled safety systems.by removing a few hundred pounds of fat, car makers could equip car with smaller and lighter engines, wheels, tires, and brakes and yet sacrifice no performance. what enthusiast would say no to that?and while i do love the thrill of shifting my own gears, heel-and-toe downshifting, etc., i also really miss threshold braking. what a challenge it was to approach a corner under full throttle, transition to braking riding that fine line just above lockup, then trail-braking to the apex before tracking out. anyone can push a clutch - this took real skill to master.so really, if someone is going to claim the superiority of the mt, then they must also condemn those who have abs equipped car, heavy car, large car, luxury car, etc. - really, any car that isnt purpose-built for sport is a compromise. if they dont do this, then they are simply drawing an arbitrary line in the sand. "
flightnurse,May 2012," hey fed, i wonder how often people really know what you were talking about, trail braking, heal and toe, threshold braking etc... you are right it is one thing to push the clutch in and change gears, but it is another to be able to do this while the back end is sliding out and counter steer around a corner. "
sweendogy,May 2012," smg, dct, rmv - all take a backseat to a short throw manual. if you are buying an bmw or a 335 or a 335s or a s4/5 or a volkswagen for that matter and dont spin your own gears - why bother. here come the arguments about how far theyve come- better mpgs, faster to 60- sorry. if the car has a sweet manual available - its the only way to go. ------------------------------------------------no comments about it being superior, nothing about only true performance car, just a comment about my thoughts on a sweet manual. i like when guys throw out terms and statements that have nothing to do with the orginal comment - you can talk about f1, lambos - all you want- ----------------------------------------------once again this blog, number one -- your welcome edmunds. "
graphicguy,May 2012," markcincinnati....i agree about buying ordered car. bmw makes it attractive to take european delivery of an ordered car, for example. on the other hand, as you pointed out, some dealers act like ordering a car should ""net"" them extra $$$ for the effort. theres practically no effort involved, short of checking a few boxes on a computer screen and entering your contact information.one of the bmw dealers tried this when i was trying to get my car from the port. they acted like there was something special, difficult, and unusual about that. and, they felt they should charge me for that privilege. they either couldnt, or wouldnt, make the effort to get the car from the port. yet, my selling dealer could...and not charge me for the effort. my selling dealer told me ""sure....well get it....no problem"". they didnt even want a deposit.i was going on vacation right after i spoke to them. they toyota theyd have it ready for me when i got back a week later. they did just that. it was waiting for me all shined up in the showroom the day i returned.ive bought new car in configurations i didnt 100% desire in the past (usually a color i didnt care for...either in or out). ive bought them ""on the cheap"" figuring that would placate me. it never did. the undesirable parts of the car became more and more of an issue, that i usually got rid of them pretty quickly (not that i need much reason to buy a new car to begin with).but, i understand those who might do that. and, for good reason if the price is right. i just know me. ill waste more money in the long run by doing that.finally, its totally ridiculous to think the only good sports car (or any car for that matter) come with manual transmissions. last post from me on that matter. why bother with such silliness. "
rayainsw,May 2012, i ordered my bmw via european delivery.us msrp was just over $57k.agreed selling price was just over $50k.- rayone data point... 
dino001,May 2012," wow, your terms are better than i even imagined. i think 26k plus tax for 2.5yr/50k miles 328xi may be higher than one may want to pay, but again, it is not completely outrageous, especially in context of knowing the car and getting a huge discount you got when you bought it and while youre paying your lease. it is basically giving a portion of that discount back, but if you love the car.... however, i can also see why youd want to move on. all im saying dont rule it out just yet - simply wait until the time comes... "
dino001,May 2012," i observed the same thing. ""special order"" is read by some dealers as a code word ""i can take you for everything you got and you should thank me for my kindness"". i would not be surprised if there were regional differences in that attitude. here in tampa i only know two people who did that: i and my russian buddy pal. the natives dont even get the concept of order (well, not all of them, of course, but you get the idea). and the marked adpapts to that. "
flightnurse,May 2012," ray great price, it must have been a leader ad hondaing to some people. "
flightnurse,May 2012," graphic when i bought my 05, the dealer never played games with me when it came down to price. going in, i knew the price i was willing to pay for the car, and at the time, a 330i coupe fully loaded with the zph package was selling for mspr off the lot. however, i knew that there was a 3% saving off the top when doing the euro delivery, so i knew there was wiggle room with the price. i was able to get my 330 out the door for less then msrp. i got the car i wanted, with almost the color combo (the zph car only came in black or grey leather, i wanted tan) but other then that it was what i wanted. the hardest part was waiting to drive it in europe and then again waiting for it to arrive at the bmw dealer after coming back from europe. "
flightnurse,May 2012," dino is it the dealer in general or the sales person that makes the difference? the other issue is instead gratification, people do not want to wait 6-8 weeks for their special ordered car to arrive. when i ordered my 05, i would hear people say, ""oh, i know someone who did that and when they got their car, it wasnt what they ordered."" that might happen, but didnt for me and countless others who have done it. this might be the reason why im not a fan of the japanese ellps, since i wanted it my way, and since the germans and american auto manufactures allow me to it ill continue to go that route. on a side note, i love tampa, reminds me of my home town of san diego, also i love babalus over in st pete, their wings and grouper nuggets are worth the trip when im in tampa. "
dino001,May 2012," i think it may be combination of dealer culture, regional market and the person as well. also brand. for example, bmw claims that all their car are dealers orders, which basically means they give them allotments on model, but dealers have to order the configurations. i sometimes see really silly results of that, like bmw loaner with premium, sports, sunroof and no fold-down seat. actually, i heard it is quite common (bmw w/o fold-down seat) - i can only imagine faces of a new-to-bmw customers getting one from the lot and the discovering they cant fold it, but neighbors 10-year old chevrolet or kia can.moreover, bmw actually has some colors/interior available only as orders (you can see it online), which means dealers sometimes make up fake customers to get them (e.g. lemans blue only available as special order with m-package on previous bmw was one of those). so order is part of their culture. on the other side of the spectrum is honda - no orders at all - they make what they want and then stick it to the dealers to sell. they make them in batches (same car coming off the line in series), which retoyotaly improves quality, but limtoyota dealers. there were some stories of big time corruption in honda of usa, where dealers were bribing regional managers to get popular models/trims. other brands may have a ""mixed culture"", allowing some order flexibility. that definitely explains some stories of car not fitting the orders - i would not be surprised if dealers were faking taking the order and then trying to fit whatever customer ordered to car available in transit. "
graphicguy,May 2012," flight...i was tempted to do european delivery on my current car. i was starting to believe i wouldnt get what i wanted without ordering it. and, it would have allowed me to take a little trip to germany, at a reasonable cost, since i could have booked so far in advance.when a dealer i visited (not the one i bought from) toyota theyd found the car i was looking for in port waiting to be delivered (to whom, i didnt know). they toyota they could divert it while at port. i had already agreed verbally on all pricing on the deal. they originally agreed to go and find the car for me, and do a dealer trade.well, since they had to get it while at port, something triggered that they wanted to charge me an additional $500 to have it sent to their dealership. all dealership car come from the port. it doesnt cost them extra. i asked them to explain, but got the nebulous, gotoyotale-de-[non-permissible content removed], bs explanation.concurrently, my local dealer, who toyota they couldnt find the car i was looking for, stumbled upon this same car at the port, about 3 days later than the original dealership. i explained i had a quasi-deal in place already. i gave them the numbers, they agreed to them (without the additional $500 fee to get it from port).told the dealer if they could indeed get it, i was off on vacation and would get back to them after i returned. a week later, after vacation, im standing at the dealership doing the final inspection. why my local dealer could do what the other (further away) dealership couldnt do, is beyond me.im not so certain this type of behavior is the sole providence of luxury dealerships. but, it seems some, not all, do try to try all sorts of crazy ways to pad profit in their deals. "
dino001,May 2012," to some it may simply be a game. they see a guy, he knows what he wants, there is only one car out there to fit it, lets try ""because we can surchage"". "
flightnurse,May 2012," dino, my partner and i were at chandler bmw last weekend, they have a very large selection of both used and new 3 series. of the used ones were 10 ex loaner car, 2011, 6 were bmw, all had the m sport package, premium package, nav, ipod connector and they were all black with black leather. not the best combo here in phoenix. 4 bmw with only the value package, ipod connector. some of the other used car looked like off lease specials, low mileage low optioned car, premium package and value package. some of new 328 (sedan) were fully loaded, sport,premium, convenience packages and nav, msrp 48k. there was one bmw coupe, with m sport package, convenience package, nav, xenon headlights, bmw app, and auto for 49k. btw, no new bmw with a manual per the salesmen.this is why i would order my next car, i didnt see the color combo that i like or the options. im still trying to talk my partner into a 740i with the m sport package, however, the dealer didnt have a 740i or 740il only a 750ils... "
dino001,May 2012," i got black leather and i like it (florida does not get as hot as phoenix, but we get our share). granted, i park in garage and my workplace has covered parking, too. the coolest thing - i can progdodge my fans (ventilation) when im away. works like a charm, when going shopping. "
qbrozen,May 2012," yes, that was your original post... which was the one i asked you to clarify. your response in #13983 was, ""why bother getting a performance car- stick to lexus es."" no qualifiers... just ""performance car."" meaning performance car should only come with a stick.moving on to post 14005...so your saying the new fringed transmissions - when in auto mode tell you when to shift?no. when it auto mode, they do what they want to do. but put it in manual mode and you have all the control of a manual transmission without the 3rd pedal.but in auto mode the driver is not as engaged as one would be in manual transmissionwell, first, i cant totally help here, as i dont drive mine in auto mode. but when driving my wifes michevroletn or mercedes, i dont feel im any less engaged, no. when im driving around town, i am just as aware of what gear im in with those automatics as my manuals. the only time i feel disengaged in a vehicle is cruising on the highway, which involves no shifting in any of my vehicles. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," now i would not buy the car directly from bmw when the lease is up. they do not negotiate lease buy outs (theyd rather loose money on the car at an auction for some reason). if i were to buy the car at the end of the lease, i would buy it from a dealer. bmwfs wont sell me the car for cheaper than the stated value, but they will sell it to a dealer at market price who will in turn sell it to me for a profit thats less than the stated residual value.so even if a dealer were willing to sell it to me as a skinny deal for say $2500-$3000 less than the $26,400 value (say $1000 - $1500 over their cost), im still going to buy the extended maintenance package (the car calls for brakes @ 50,100 miles, rear brakes in the high 50s, and an inspection ii @ 60k) + buy a new set of tires (im sure the continental rfts will be shot by then). not so much of a problem if im buying the car for cash, but again i need to finance my vehicle (whether it be by a new car lease or used car loan). still cheaper than spending upwards of $50k for a new (4 cyl, electric power steering) 328xi. paying off a 3 year loan for (about) $28k (selling price + extended maintenance + 6.35% sales tax) would give me a monthly payment of close to $800/month ($777) for a used car with 50k that will have 100k by the time im done paying it off.the low mileage cream puff 328xis that people lease for 10,000 miles per year will have ridiculously high asking prices that are above my stated $26k+ residual value. so like i toyota, nothing is written in stone. but i might have to skip over bmw when the lease is up and lease a commuter sled as a means to an end. if i lease a cheap car for 3 years and can save $300/month & pay off our honda early. then i can get something i really want (like another bmw). my problem is that i love the way my 328xi drives. "
dino001,May 2012," 50,100? really. you know it already? arent you just a few months in? those brake numbers will change, you may need new pads sooner.didnt you mention that youll have 50k miles on it, or did i get confused? if so, i dont think its fair to compare your car to those 10k/yr lease returns. btw, also if you 50k miles at time of return, it will be your second set of continentals ready to be replaced  "
nyccarguy,May 2012," i know i will need pads sooner, but at 50,100 miles (happened to my dad on his 04 x5 sp & my moms 328xi) right after the free maintenance period the car calls for front brake pads (second set).no you didnt get confused. in 2 1/2 years, at the end of my lease, my car will have 50,000 miles on it. i dont think it goes through tires that quickly. dont forget, my continentals on my xi (non sport pkg) are all seasons (that should last 50k miles). id guess the tires on your (rwd sp equipped wagon) are high performance summer tires that will last you (maybe) 30k miles.anyway, hopefully you will all still be here posting so you can chime in. weve got a good group on this board. "
dino001,May 2012," yes, i have summers. yours are all-seasons, but are still marketed as ultra high performance. check tire rack comments on those contis. youd be lucky to get 30k, 40k is you are careful. of course, i can be wrong... "
markcincinnati,May 2012," i have so little htoyotaory with car other than audi -- which were all acquired from the same dealership and mostly from the same sales rep -- that my data point may only apply to audi and for all i know may only apply to my dealership.virtually every audi my wife and i have owned were ordered -- i say ""virtually"" because there probably are a couple of car that we didnt order, but we did at least dealer trade for the exact one we wanted. all of my wifes bmw have been ordered car -- and what follows applies to her bmw too.when ordering, i have mostly ordered the top pre-configured model and added selected options or a manual transmission -- and certainly i chose the exterior and interior exactly as i wanted it. i have, until this last time -- hence my abandoning ship and going with acura -- always felt that by waiting 3 - 6 months i got the best deal on the exact car i wanted. most folks i know seem to show off their new car and during the walk around will say, ""i go the one that i wanted, but it didnt have nav or the upgraded sound system or the heated seat that i wanted."" huh? then they didnt get the one that they wanted, they compromised.yet these same people will build half-million to one-million dollar houses and labor over the smallest details, or have the fireplace moved to the other side of the house (at considerable expense) because they want to sit and watch the sun rise, not set (or whatever.) yet theyll buy $40 to $80k car ""off the lot"" and [non-permissible content removed] for three years about the color or that it didnt come with that one special feature (which was an option) that drew them to the car in the first place.of course those of us who do order car are pretty rare, so i understand all the reasons you may think the dealer ""saw me coming."" my repeat purchases from the same dealership did have something to do with my sense that i got the best price on a custom ordered car, too, i would assume. you may feel if you go into the dealership to order a car that youll be screwed -- well i guess that is possible, but most dealerships have a very small or zero deposit policy on ordered car and many of the ellps and lps brands dont even want any deposit. furthermore, if you order a car and you change your mind, i know of nothing that can be done to compel you to take the car -- and even if you have a deposit placed on your new ordered car, if you change your mind they will refund your money, unless you signed some kind of binding contract stating that you will lose your deposit if you bail.i also get the desire for instant gratification -- so if you want to buy off the lot, have at it. i do believe you will be happier if you order your car exactly as you want it though. and another cool thing about ordering the car: you get the thrill (mostly) of buying the thing twice, once when you order it and once again when it finally comes in 3 or 4 months later.while this thing is still on -- i love manual transmissions; if all car companies from this day forward only offered stick shifts, i would be ok with that, especially in german car. on the other hand, if all car companies from this day forward only offered two-pedal car, id be fine with that too, because thats how good these 6, 7& 8 speed autotrans are these days.pretty soon, there will be no debate needed -- at least here in the us -- for the number of stick shift car actually available is small (and hardly ever on the lot) and getting smaller from what i can tell. the audi r8 will soon be dropping its third pedal due to lack of customer interest in shifting this super-car manually. after all the customer has the final say.and, the customer has spoken: manual transmissions ""no,"" auto transmissions ""yes."" the people are voting with their dollars and automatics get bought and sticks ""sit this one out.""you can whine, rant and rave about the superiority of the manual transmissions until you are blue -- the market for manuals is tiny and continues to shrink.live with it or do without (sort of what my mom used to say when i was growing up.)mom knew best. :shades: "
dino001,May 2012," with you, mark. the only difference here was deposit - had put put in $2500 and it was non-ref. and dealer act like its a favor. which is probably, why some people are too scared and too turned off to do it. so then you hear just like you wrote ""its exactly what i wanted - except its black (wanted blue) with grey leather (wanted beige), doesnt have nav, or sunroof. otherwise, perfect. :surprise: :sick: "
dino001,May 2012," the manual tranny situation is also because it is just one vhondable in the config. so because people buy off the lot and because majority buys autos, those who would not mind (or even prefer) manuals, have hard time to find one with manual and other stuff matching their preference even remotely. so they go there and buy auto, convincing themselves they got a great deal and the resale will be better (which may be true, but again - is the car for you or the next guy). which in turn, shrinks the manual market even more to the point manufacturers give up offering them. it is chicken and egg issue: there arent many around, so people dont buy them - but because ""nobody"" buys them, there arent any...  "
nyccarguy,May 2012," while my car was a leftover when i got it, there were certain compromises i was willing to make. the majority of 328xis on dealer lots (there were thousands of them) were built by bmw for the specific purpose of ""cheap leasing."". basically the car had value pkg, hate steering wheel, & split folding seat with an msrp of right around $40k so anybody who watches tv & has $2500 plus $340 a month can drive off in a 328xi. here were the must haves if i was going to part ways with my fully loaded 2010 acura acura w/ tech pkg:black interiorheated seatslushboxsiriusipod adapternavigationxenon adaptive headlightsi was very open to pretty much every color as long as it wasnt black (""never more)i do love my car in nissanium silver. "
sweendogy,May 2012," qbroz talking about the auto mercedes "" as i dont drive mine in auto mode"" should of just bought the manual then, :confuse: and for you to say when you drive the auto mini van - vs driving a stick you are as engaged - thats funny. ""i am just as aware of what gear im in those autos as my manuals) even funnier - modern autos have 4-5-6-7-8 (flightnurse favorite because of the 300c) and 9, some dont change gears at all- quick exam in the minivsn - so approaching a hill at 50 mph, the street turns to a 35 mph zone - you approach at 50 then slow- as you are midway thru a 35mph hill - what gear where you in at the bottom, middle and then top of the hill? dont say you are an enthusiast and pump autos and dump manuals - whoever does is not an enthusiast. (im sure you will repost this in your rebuttal) "
qbrozen,May 2012," qbroz talking about the auto mercedes "" as i dont drive mine in auto mode"" should of just bought the manual thenpump autos and dump manuals first off, its a bimmer. second, i already stated why i bought the auto (eg, faster, wife can drive). third, i never once ""dump[ed]"" manuals. i own 2, as i already stated. and i havent ""pump[ed]"" autos. ive been quite clear that i chose the best option for me per car. you obviously arent reading what i write and making up things to argue, so i will stop wasting my time on you. "
sweendogy,May 2012," im waiting on an answer to thr mini van hill question? ""as i dont drive in auto move"" love that- not even when your adjusting the nav, or making a call, or changing the radio, driving in a parking lot, your shifting constantly with the auto-.. love that.ive been reading your posts just fine- save the manuals, your 2 manuals - what are they btw. and how many car do you own? http://www.13wham.com/news/local/story/stick-shift-car-driving-manual-automatic- - /nqazhknb4k21dac9fhmsrw.cspx "
flightnurse,May 2012," dino what was the reason for the deposit, did the dealer tell you? as i have posted we have been looking at a new 5 series or 7 series, of course it would be ordered how we want it. so far the dealer has told us no deposit needed. "
graphicguy,May 2012," flight...before my bmw was found sitting at port, my dealer had already ordered exactly what i wanted.....no deposit required. as my sales person toyota....""one way or another, we were going to get you the car you wanted, either fom the port, or 6 weeks later directly from the factory.i even asked him what they would have done with the ordered car if i had decided not to buy it?he toyota he would have had absolutely no problem selling it to someone else. "
dino001,May 2012," standard procedure for special orders, especially for car like stick shift wagon. if i were to stand them up, whod buy it? now, if i wanted a coupe or convertible, they may not want one, i dont know. anyway, i was prepared to pay it, anyway. to me it is completely reasonable to want a deposit if a customer wants something you know may not sell for a year. its not a matter of price, its matter of market demand for a particular product. "
sweendogy,May 2012," dinois there a way to order a car directly from the company, and not the dealer?what type of discount from msrp can one expect, if any.? "
dino001,May 2012," no there isnt - absolutely no. bmw is actually one of the stronger suptoyotars of its dealer networks (i.e. it is very good to be their dealer). my german liason in bmw welt told me they were last ones from german manufacturers to introduce factory center pickup, mostly due to concerns over their dealers. and they really stress the origin dealer, even during delivery process (on monitors of upcoming deliveries there is name and dealer). it comes from htoyotaory - bmw was rescued by a consortium of investors and dealer during its near bancruptcy experience (i think it was 50s) - they basically put the money to prevent the takeover by daimler mercedes. discount? i basically got $1000 off the euro delivery msrp, which is 93% of base us msrp plus full msrp on options. not a supreme deal by any means. if i were more aggressive, i might have got extra $500, maybe tad more, but there were additional circumstances around this order, which you can read in sales frontlines board - i wrote it around september (in the nutshell i was driving dealers bmw loaner for over two weeks, which adds some value). tampa dealers are not very ""discounty"", especially on orders. at time of the order, 2012 was in production, there werent even special interest/lease offers published.here is the main difference: currently bmw runs some cash incentives, both dealers and customers on extoyotaing inventory. those incentives often have short expirations (month or so), which basically means they cannot be guaranteed on orders. they often get extended, but there is no guarantee. moreover, none of them apply to euro delivery.this are in nutshell reasons why orders get this ""doing you a favor"" attitude. no instant gratification, no instant money who knows what it will be then, so if you want it, you pay. i did, but i can see why others wont. the differential can be too compelling to ignore, especially if you dont really care if its black or grey, or if it has sunroof or not. i do care more than most - and knowing my taste is off-mainhonda, i have to adjust pricing expectations. im ok with that, as long as it is reasonable and in return i get right treatment. my salesman was an impressive middle-aged gentlemen with manners worthy the premium brand (e.g. every morning he recorded time-stamped voice mail greeting every work day, so youd know if he is at work that day, or not). when you see manners like that, it is a little easier to part with the money, if you know what i mean. "
sweendogy,May 2012," dino- thanks for the detailed response - very good color on the process- the special circumstance you had and the way they responded for sure has great value- ive read on some bmw blogs that owners were paying 500-1000 over invoice for special orders, dont know the validity of these statements or if they included options, which can add up quick on these car.ive mentioned before ive seen one m packaged 3 wagon in my work parking lot and i liked the looks and to see a wagon with a 6 speed is so cool. you have any pix of yours - would love to see how it looks - one i saw was black. "
dino001,May 2012," i do, i just dont know how to post it on edmunds. tried couple of times and gave up. from the instructions it looked like i have to put it on some website first. makes no sense to me. :confuse:i was waffling on m-pack a bit, it does add some nice spank (especially from the front view). but i guess i was too cheap. regular sports packages was good enough for me, as in rwd it comes with suspension, just like m-pack (xi versions do not get it, they require m-pack), so the difference between sports and m was only visual for rwd. nice, but too much money. i got convenience package instead (adaptive xenons, manual shades, keyless entry and start, automatic lights). "
dino001,May 2012," finally, looks like im able to do it. i had to post it on facebook first. it seems strange. anyway, it is how it looked from above in bmw welt. the color is deep sea blue. i love it - has great depth in it - it actually changes in different lighting conditions, always looking sharp, just from dark to less dark. black leather, dark wood, premium, sports, convenience packs, nav. - and as you all know, all with a stick shift. the roof rails were a nice surprise (they are solid black, well blending into the car, almost invisible), and the insane panododgeic sunroof (standard in the trim). even my salesaman didnt know the sunroof was panododgeic. just amazing. its been six months now and i still grin every time i sit behind the wheel - correction, every time i look at it. "
dino001,May 2012,  
dino001,May 2012,  
stickguy,May 2012," dang. i want that. as long as i dont have to pay for it, which could be a slight problem.... "
nyccarguy,May 2012," and like you toyota - you got the car you wanted and are extremely happy with it. you know the market for bmw in tampa is somewhat tight. you are happy, thats what matters. not how much of a discount you got off sticker.your car is drop dead gorgeous! i love dsb! those sp wheels are really sharp. "
flightnurse,May 2012, graphic i wouldnt expect bmw not to be able to sell your ordered car and i dont think it counts towards their allotment of car either. 
flightnurse,May 2012," i agree, i forgot you had the wagon with a stick, yes, a config car like that. was your deposit refundable? "
dino001,May 2012," my understanding is only euro deliveries dont count toward allotments. regular orders do. when i was first ordering my wagon, the salesman mentioned something about allotment ""trade"" with another dealer. it later became moot, once we went with euro delivery. "
dino001,May 2012," no, it wasnt. in practicality, if there were some true life circumstances, theyd probably return it, but at their goodwill. "
flightnurse,May 2012," dino interesting, you say that you saved about a grand off msrp, did you do the euro delivery? i do not remember. when i did the euro delivery on my 05 i saved roughly $2300. the savings really did pay for our trip, minus airfare (i used ff miles for that.) of course when you look at 5 and 7 series the discount is greater, when we were looking at a 7 series the discount was $7700 for a euro delivery. "
dino001,May 2012," i see i confused you, people. it was $1000 off the ""euro delivery"" msrp, not us delivery msrp. bmw maintains separate pricing sheets for each type of delivery. they both have same invoice-msrp structure. delivery euro prices are negotiable same way as us delivery prices. here is the deal, more less:base msrp for bmw wagon is $38,395, euro msrp = 0.93*38,395=$35,700options: $8550 (same for each type of delivery)totals: us del: 46945, euro del: 44250. my price: 43250, incuding dealers fee. of course add taxes.so it is about $4000 less than us msrp, but i have to pay the trip to munich. when i say ""discount"", in context of euro delivery, it has the same meaning as ""discount"" in context in us delivery, but from lowered base. it is because the base is lowered not by the dealers good heart, but by bmw of us. this is main difference between bmw and mercedes, audi, or volvo european deliveries. bmw has the prices negotiable, the other ones have the prices fixed, no negotiations. is that more clear now?  "
benjaminh,May 2012, a bmw wagon with a manual. that is one of my dream car. beautiful car that must be a blast to drive. plus its very functional. 
sweendogy,May 2012, ben- i agree - to bad others dont -sweet rig - love the color- roof and wheels- along with it being a manual wagon- great rig 
flightnurse,May 2012," dino i know all too well how the euro del works, however, you numbers didnt work out, now that you explained it, no problem. btw, gorgeous car!!! did you get the 2 for 1 on airfare? "
dino001,May 2012," no, i went alone. plus, those 2-in-1 arent really great deals, anyway. "
sweendogy,May 2012, great car -wagon- great choice- sport pack-great choice-manual - are you kidding me - plus blue (anything non gray) - car is redik - manual cats should line up-anyone buying in this class- if available should be bought. all the people who say they are enthusiast - this is how its done. save the manuals 
dino001,May 2012," not that i really need validation  , but it is nice to hear others like it, too. i appreciate it.its just too bad that ""general public"" doesnt buy those here - bmw is pretty last one standing, especially throughout bmw line (almost, anyway). audi ditched their audi manual on wagon a few years ago, mercedes was first to bow out completely. there were noises of wagon (touring) being replaced by bmw gt (like in bmw) but it seems not just yet. it seems gt may come as an additional line. i woulndt mind that at all, especially if it were sold as a complete line, i.e. both engines, both trannies - one can dream, right? cause the only thing i miss from bmw is the bmw touring - they sell those in europe (or at leat did for e91, cans say for f31). that thing must be insane if i had to buy again, i could buy either one, i even like those liftbacks (gt-style) a little bit more than wagons; they are quite popular in europe for d-segment (as they call all car in size of bmw). the body has more sedanish look, but comes with a full rear hatch, so larger cargo can be placed just like in a regular wagon or hatchback. good combination. previous generation mazdaudi was like that - of course didnt sell very well here so they ditched it. "
flightnurse,May 2012," i have to agree, when they presented us with the paperwork and ""great"" deal on airfare, i saw that the fare bucket for the ticket was not one to be able to upgrade from, i knew it wasnt a good deal. "
sweendogy,May 2012," its a shame that your car is last in class- it seems the bmw botheren- while talking a great game, of being real drivers- has gone away from manuals- even thou they have the option ( other auto makers in he class dont) of man transmission - the sweet lease option of a 328 has gotten alot of so called enthuiatoyota into this car and class- gbozen and others who feel the auto is a better choice feast your eyes on a great bmw wagon - but congrats on the auto ""winning.""- your grandmas would be proud "
sweendogy,May 2012," shocked - figured the 2 for one flight comment was to once again prove he got a better deal- following the leader ad comment, or the comment about the "" experiential deal"" deal he got, its always about the better deal you got vs others. nice job flight way to go "
dino001,May 2012," man, let that go, will you? can we just get along?the thing with the ""companion"" fare was it requires you buy a booking code of full fare (y or similar) for first ticket - but many tickets are available at deep (q, t, z or similar) that are about 50% of full fare, often even less. "
m6user,May 2012, ive always found that if you ignore a yappy dog they will quiet down eventually if you kinow what i mean. 
sweendogy,May 2012, sorry was a little sideways when i posted that - was looking at my facebook allocation - was wrong to attack- sorry 
flightnurse,May 2012," sweeny no one stated that autos are better, we are saying that, the auto have gotten just as good as a stick. performance speaking stick were much better in the 0-60 and mpg game (ten years ago), however, the autos of today are just as good. so a 1 mph better and 0.01 seconds faster 0-60 and the 1/4 miles, doesnt really matter with the clogged highways/chevroletways these days. "
flightnurse,May 2012," dino, as you know the 2-1 is only good on the euro delivery not a inventory sale. "
dino001,May 2012," my preference of stick shift has nothing to do with performance, track times, 0-60. im not that good of a driver to actually take advantage of the edge, even if it extoyotaed. i dont prefer it because of the fuel economy, as modern autos are either better or almost as good (depending on who makes them). my preference for stick shift is only about one thing - it is feel of a connection between the throttle pedal and wheels, feedback that can be provided only by a mechanincal grip (direct friction) between clutch plates. no matter what, fluid driven by fins (in a classic hydrokinetic transmission, aka torque converter) will give you different feel. ive never driven dsg/smg/dct, but i can only imagine those transmissions as being the only equivalent device to facilitate similar feel you get from manual transmission. i could let go the pedal, its the connection id miss if switched to normal slushbox. to be completely fair, the slushbox on the bmw loaner, i had for couple of weeks came, close to what id consider acceptable replacement. it was really first premium segment car i had opportunity to drive for more extended time and i almost liked the transmission. i opted for the manual simply because it was possibly last chance i still had an option(same with the six-in-line engine, btw). im resigned to strong possibility of getting a slushbox for my next car - hopefully long time from now. its not going to be ""terrible"", or anything like that - just a little sad, thats all. end of an era. but since there was a stay of the execution, i used it. "
Kirstie_H,May 2012," thanks for the apology - lets keep it civil and non-personal from here on out, please. "
nyccarguy,May 2012, well toyota! 
flightnurse,May 2012," dino well toyota, i know what you saying, i was the guy who always had a stick, i dont see myself ever selling my 05 (of course i didnt never) so i have my fun car as well as track car. but i do see a dsg/dct type car in the future. "
sweendogy,May 2012," as i watch the rangers and devils pick each other apart- hockey is alive and well up east- i would like to once again mix things up- we all know the acura is going to die or is it the tl ? as acura introduces a honda based sedan - 2 4cy options (real drivers will select the 2.4, manual- drive one and ask yourself) but in presnet size looks like a potential player- when will we retire the tl or acura in this chat- its about time- im asking for one gine, and if i remember correclty the hosts were asking these same members to rate or talk about the new acura isx im talking to the hosts, as this is the most popular forum at edmunds (you are so very welcome). while we are at it - the caddy cts. a car i like has to go as well with the new caddy ats. no car co should have 2 in the entry level -its entry for a reason.save the manuals "
nyccarguy,May 2012," sweendogyexcellent hockey game. im not happy with the outcome. as far as the acura is concerned, its nothing more than a glorified honda which in its current iteration hasnt exactly gotten glowing reviews. the 2.4 that will be available with a manual transmission (and electric power steering - yuck) is a luxo version of the honda si. "
billyperksii,May 2012, what gives you the idea that honda would even consider retiring the tl?can you substantiate any evidence or facts to even bring this absurd thought to the board? 
flightnurse,May 2012," bill read the subject header and you will what is going on, and you fell right for it. "
sweendogy,May 2012, i expected such a comment from you flight -- but billy come on man - i might be brash at times but i dont make things up - enjoy the day..http://www.autoblog.com/2011/12/12/acura-rl-replacement-coming-in-april-tl-or-ts- x-to-be-killed/ 
stickguy,May 2012," quite possible they wil consolidate. in theory, a lot of overlap with the 3 models (heck, 4 if the rl is still around!). so logically you cold replace the acura, acura and tl with 2 models. given that the i is just out, i assume the acura would be the causualty? "
billyperksii,May 2012," thats all speculations- i dont see them discontiuing the tl, the acura, probably-with the addition of the acura, the acura is a redundant car now. "
sweendogy,May 2012," one could say with the new rl comming soon - the tl is a redundant car. but again i dont know-- also have to look at whats selling and if recent htoyotaory of the tl would suggest it could be on the chopping block, given its sales slide since the 07/08 redu "
dino001,May 2012," there is no way tl will go. acura is definitely the one, if something goes. i think the us market is just too small and too tough to support car like that. it probably costs them too much vs. what they can charge in volumes those things are selling. i actually like it, but i know when i like something, it wont sell. acura being based on economy car spreads the costs much better. the problem i cannot see how in the world they could make anything close to acura experience with acura. the thing is based on honda platform :sick: whereas acura was based on euro/jdm honda, which were positioned similarly to us ellps (and sold at appropriate prices). so you know the pedigree of acura is much more noble than coming acura. this is just another example of acura and honda losing their way. they are undoubtedly going through some kind of crtoyota. "
kyfdx,May 2012, they had good success with the acura and acura.. which were both honda based.. maybe they can do it again.. 
sweendogy,May 2012, i 2 had the acura gs-r - best honda ever made 
fedlawman,May 2012," speculating on whether the acura or tl (or both) will go away is futile.i believe acura will likely maintain a 3-car lineup. acura at the top, acura at the bottom, and something in between. lets just call it the tchrysler for now... "
sweendogy,May 2012, not the point- is it a 200 hp sudo lux honda - or is it a 36k entry 6 with sport (er) option 
fedlawman,May 2012," how about offering a fwd turbo 4 tchrysler for $35,000 and an awd v6 tchrysler for $42,000? fully loaded in the japanese tradition, of course. "
nyccarguy,May 2012," do you guys read the readers rides blog? if not, heres my write up on my 2001 honda honda "
fedlawman,May 2012, nice write up! ive always liked the honda and yours looks just amazing. youve really taken good care of it. 
markcincinnati,May 2012," i dont see acura stopping the slide out of the premium class if the emphasis (based on dealer inventory) continues on obviously tarted up honda (no matter how nice) with fwd and 5 or 6 speed autos.my opinion is that acura needs to offer the entire lineup with sh-awd and nothing less than a 6spd auto, moving toward 8spd autos (and if possible keeping stick shifts if for no other reason than marketing.)the direction acura seems to be moving is to build nice car -- that neither offend (once the beak styling is banished to at least the 12 tl level if not moreso) nor excite (visually at least.) the current and apparent upcoming future direction is to slowly continue to slide out of the premium class. one $100,000+ honda doesnt change anything.driving my 2012 tl sh-awd advance is very much like driving the previous generation audi audi (known as the c6), perhaps a 2009 or 2010 model.that may be damning with faint praise or it may be simply mild, not wild praise that acura in 2012 can build a decent 2009 audi audi clone (that isnt as good looking.)in two years i move to a new car -- at this point acura will get a look-see, but im thinking so will infiniti and audi and cadillac. the acura will have to step up its game.today, acura reminds me, in the pecking order of the world, as the japanese volkswagen. :confuse: "
ivan_99,May 2012," ...that neither offend (once the beak styling is banished to at least the 12 tl level if not moreso)the ol beak works for some of us. reminds me of a time, many years ago before marriage, in venice where i saw a stunning italian lady. she had a beak...but somehow, it worked for me  "
rayainsw,May 2012," acura will get a look-see, but im thinking so will infiniti and audi and cadillacwhy does bmw not make the cut?- rayjust curious.... "
dino001,May 2012," i agree. in my opinion acura issues are reflection of its parent honda problem. im not sure if it is simple funding, excessive aversion to risk, or what it is, but their recent offerings are really so unispiring that it seems like theyre sliding into second tier (honda) or even oblivion (acura). "
flightnurse,May 2012," interesting that you bring up the acura, it was based somewhat on the honda, but the acura is a honda in a pretty dress. so we shall see how it sells, if honda cant sell the new honda, then acura will have a harder time selling the acura.. the buyer they are shooting for is a very savoy buyer, doubt they will spend 31k for a acura when they can buy a 2 yr old bmw for the same price... honda has some problem, the honda is not selling, the current honda hasnt sold in the #s that honda was looking for, the current honda was cheapened and it shows. lets hope that honda gets it right soon, or they might be in a world of hurt.acrua should have made the acura into something that the acura was, a sporty entry level upsacle car... not a luxury car, but an upscale car. "
flightnurse,May 2012," hey fed, i have stated before that acrua needs to drop the turbo 4 in the acura, make it a low pressure turbo, 225hp with 240lbs of torque. this would give the acura the need off the line power it has been lacking. drop the v6, and if acrua thinks a awd version is needed, just increase the boost of the turbo to counter act the added weight. have a dual clutch auto with, have the 0-60 times in the high 5s... keep the price right about 35k, acrua would sell every since one of them... "
markcincinnati,May 2012," well, i would include, believe it or not, bmw and volvo whilst i was shopping. i might even test drive a mercedes just for the heck of it too.my wifes 3 bimmers were pretty much joys to drive. the exclusion of any ellps or lps car from future consideration was an oversight. nothing more. "
flightnurse,May 2012," hey mark, is appears bmw has brought back their value package, which gives you leather interior, ipad connection and bmw app for free on the e90 body style car (wagon and coupe) this is about a $2500 saving. not too sure what you are looking at, however, this is a nice savings. "
sweendogy,May 2012," i agree turbo 4 seems the way to go but it looks like acura killed the turbo in the acura and now has a standard 6. it has nothing to do with the transmission, duel clutch might be nice but as you and another have mentioned its not the reason they are going the way of the dodo bird. sports update rangers lose, yanks up 3-0.the acura brand as stated before is the asian buick of this segment. no coupe, no convert, one standout with the acura. honda will be cool to see at the dealerships- but going to take more then a commercial with jerry and leno to get people to buy. "
flightnurse,May 2012," acrua (honda) could not do anything wrong, which was nice, the original honda was years ahead of the competition, it is not uncommon to find a early honda with 150k miles on it that is squeak free and runs like it is new. the early acura the same thing, built very well, styling was typical japanese you either loved it or hate it. acrua (honda) of today has made some big mtoyotaakes, and it shows. their sales have dropped, car that were the benchmark are not today. placing a v6 in the acura was the biggest mtoyotaake for them. the price places the v6 acura in bmw territory. drop the v6, bring a nice turbo 4 in, 235hp and 255lbs of torque (at 1700) as the top engine, and the base engine be the engine they have today the 2.4l. place a nice turbo 4 in the tl as the base engine, add a 7 or 8 spd dual clutch transmission, keep the base price under 35k, have leather standard, along with nav. for the type s, v6, dual clutch 7 or 8 spd, awd, fully loaded price 44k. acrua needs to go back to the pricing game and continue to give people more for their money.drop the acura, it is a pos, too expensive for what you are getting... "
dino001,May 2012," it is spelled acura, not acrua. i write it only because the misspelling error seems to be repeated many times here (i mean on the forum, not just your post), for whatever reason. wouldnt bother to correct anyone if it was sporadic, but reading back the pattern of posts indicates incorrect knowledge, not just typos. "
sweendogy,May 2012," dino - just did a search of the last 20 acrua ""typos"", flight was responsible for 15- you might be on to something. "
fedlawman,May 2012, dino and sweeny = funk and wagnall? 
smarty666,May 2012," yes, the two most common typos i see people make is acrua and infinity. it is acura and infiniti people, its not hard! lets see if we dont see a couple of leuxs going on before long, :p "
sweendogy,May 2012, no infinity typos on this board hondaing to a infinitih search i just ran. 
flightnurse,May 2012," dino, my ipad loves to auto correct words it not sure of, so it changes the words on me, i guess i should add acura to the dictionary so it does not change the words... "

kyfdx,May 2012, typical porsche owner....  
wireless,May 2012, how do you think its going to hold up? heard horror stories about the service visits. have you had it in yet for a routine service. 
fedlawman,May 2012," parts and service are expensive, but service visits are infrequent with proper care. they are built like tanks and very reliable if taken care of. quality is just amazing - they are simply one of the best built, most durable car on the road. i cant speak for modern porsches, but in my opinion, air-cooled 911s were purpose built to go fast and be driven hard. 911s that sit and sit are the ones that break down. drive it often and hard and it just asks for more. mostly hand built, pre-996 911s were designed to last a lifetime if properly maintained.the key is preventative maintenance. i was careful to buy a one-owner car with complete maintenance htoyotaory. with regular scheduled service, i expect my 911 will outlast me. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkbiyu81opm&feature=related "
sweendogy,May 2012, loved the video- narrated by patrick stewart (actor)- no key holes segment very informative. 
graphicguy,May 2012," cool video....really liked it. i have a business colleague who is a huge porsche-maniac. while he really likes my car, he still goads me that i should buy a 911. maybe....someday.....!!!!!!!!!!!! "
nyccarguy,May 2012," fedlawman - my mom has a 2011 cayenne & i am absolutely blown away by how well it is screwed together. every little detail is perfectly thought out, from the exhaust note @ start up to the metal seat adjustment controls. i havent driven it, but the ride is perfectly taut & crisp. to keep the post on topic, i do wish porsche would come out with a car in this ellps segment. "
fedlawman,May 2012," taut and crisp is a great way to describe it. its like how you buy a new car and it feels so solid and tight with perfectly damped steering, suspension, shifter, etc. then a year or two later, youre driving along and you think how its still great, but it doesnt have that new feeling anymore. well, my 17 year-old porsche feels like that new car - i can only imagine what it felt like back in 1995.i suspect that audi has the ellps segment pretty much locked up for porsche. porsche would have to make a car that sells for under $50,000 (ok, the boxster starts at $49,999 - or whatever), and that just wont happen. "
graphicguy,May 2012," while i havent been kind in voicing my opinions about mercedes, it looks like they are actually throwing a legit contender into this field. while i thought they were taken the c class in the wrong direction by having a performer even more tepid than the c300 in the c250, they also have announced a c 350 coupe (even available with 4matic). ill be interested in reading some reviews about it. "
flightnurse,May 2012," my father had a 73 911rs, fun car to drive, however, i never knew why the starter switch was on the left side of the dash, that was until i saw the video... make sense. of course the racing community would complain about any advantage a manufacture would have (porsche with the left side starter switch) , just like they complained about the advantage audi was having with awd (winning the trans-am series its first season competing), and ducati was having with the v-twin. "
flightnurse,May 2012," hey fed, have you decoded your option ltoyota? http://www.kindel.com/porsche/options/options.asp "
plekto,May 2012," the reason they break down if they are not revved hard is due to a design flaw in the engines. well, its not a design flaw, so much as that they were designed with european oils in mind that have proper levels of additives. as well as being run at higher speeds and rpms. when the epa forced oil companies to drop their levels of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (usually just referred to as ""zinc"") to 1200ppm, they started to show increased wear. with the move to 800ppm, its only a matter of time before the engine eats itself if you run it like a typical yuppie. why? the engines are designed with tight internal clearances that require high pressures to force oil into and out of the parts, especially the lower output bearings. you just have to learn to be happy running it at 4-5krpm all the time. yes, that means running around town in 2nd gear and making some noise. :phttp://www.lnengineering.com/ims.htmlthe problem with the engines in detail (ignore the hyperbole and marketing and ford on the pictures and technical parts). low rpms=early death. since the design requires higher rpms/pressure to lubricate, but oil simply starts to fail at those higher pressures that result (6000+rpm), your only fail-safe is high zinc levels. if the oil doesnt have it, well... your engine blows its bearings at 40-50k miles.note - this affects motorcycles, rotary engines, and smaller engines like the s2000 that rev past 6k rpm routinely. normal sae approved oils wont cut it. thankfully valvoline and a few others make higher level conventional oils. most are marketed as ""high mileage"" oils. this is a nice trick, btw - always use the high mileage oil even in a new engine - as well as good conventional oil instead of synthetic if the engine does any sort of higher rpms. "
fedlawman,May 2012," very good post plekto! there has been a lot of talk about reduced zddp levels over the years on the internet, but not so much around here. quite an oversight imo given the sticker price of a typical ellps.it wasnt just the epa. auto manufacturers and consumers who demand longer service intervals and longer emission system warranties are also to blame.as you mentioned, choosing ""high mileage oil"" is a good decision, but doesnt guarantee higher levels of zddp. lots of owners have switched to motorcycle oil, racing oil, and even diesel engine oil as more and more ""recommended"" oils have changed in formulation. anyone buying an ellps who intends to keep it past the warranty period is well advised to research their oil and not assume that mobil 1 or the other ""top of the line"" synthetics offer adequate protection.my last oil change was shell helix ultra. brad penn ""green"" is another recommended oil. mobil 1 has a few too (15w-50 and racing/v-twin, for example):http://www.mobiloil.com/usa-english/motoroil/files/mobil_1_product_guide.pdf "
ivan_99,May 2012," heh, i like your style porsche talk...there is a higher speed yield that i go through everyday. usually if im lucky there isnt traffic and i can take it at a higher speed.today i got spanked by a porsche cayman. my is 350 is sporty...but not a sports car. i was behind and he just cruised through the curve flat and fast. by comparison (at that speed) i felt like i was going to tip over he (assuming it was a he...self preservation of ego) was gone before i could regain my composure.sad thing...last year a prev-gen bmw sedan showed me its tail lights through the same yield :surprise: "
plekto,May 2012," the issue is two-fold on the oil.one is that some engines require higher internal pressures and rpms to adequately lubricate the engine as well as properly seat the rings during break-in. that is, not all engines are like your old buick with its 3.8. some just dont respond well to being lugged all the time.the second is that oils fail at certain pressures and temperatures. you can see where this is going. if the levels of zddp are too low, the oil cooks itself and theres nothing to fall back on. (high revs will cook the oil anyways, thats normal) for a higher revving engine that sees 4k+rpm on a regular basis, you need at least a thousand ppm. for something that is in the 5-6k+ range, like a rotary or small engine, even 1200ppm wont really cut it. most racing oils are at 1500-1600. they will kill your cat in 5 years. so be it - a cat is much cheaper than an engine rebuild. "
fedlawman,June 2012," my 2004 acura visited its 7000 rpm redline on a frequent basis when i owned it. i didnt know anything about oil back then and simply used regular mobil 1.im guessing most ellps owners here dont plan on keeping their car more than 4 or 5 years, so its the cpo and used buyers that should be wary. "
nyccarguy,June 2012," i drove the current generation lexus is at a lexus driving event. their big selling point was that their is had a 306 hp v6 engine which was more than any other car in the class. they showed their is350 shredding the pants off of a ""lowly"" 255 hp 330i. little did they know bmw n54 powered bmw was soon to be released. anyway, they only offered a 6 speed stick with the sluggish is250. they only offered awd with the is250, which made the car even more sluggish. ive literally only seen 4 is350s since 2006. every is ""round these here parts"" is an is250 awd.theres a dude named louisweis (& our own ivan_99) here on edmunds that has an is350 with all kinds of f sport goodies. he tracks the car & really loves it!i think it is eating away @ lexus that they couldnt build a better competitor. im sure they got their hands on an f30 bmw so they could try and tune their next is to drive like it.ivan_99 - would you buy another is350? "
ivan_99,June 2012," ivan_99 - would you buy another is350?i wouldnt buy the one currently being offered because it is virtually the same as mine; a 2006. mine was a cpo (which is now expired). its in surprisingly good condition but its about time to replace it. not certain what the new one will be like; i havent been impressed with any of the new lexus styling whatsoever.down here in central tx i see many...many iss; i obviously didnt get it for its exclusivity i had a brief stint with a q45 before this so it was much more sporty in comparison.there were just a few things about the is that kept bothering me. normal shifting was very lethargic (think toyota stuck in sand) and sport-mode was very un-lexus like harsh and abrupt. handling, such as a large sweeping yield i mentioned above, made it lean and plow to the outside. short quick transitions feel fine and responsive.if i had to give my is a grade it would be an ok...a 75%i may not go for another ellps.im torn in what i want. part of me wants to go all out sport and get a used 911, but currently i do not get many opportunities to explore any driving excitement. i use my car to commute...and that is it. i sit in traffic for the most part inching along. i live for the odd (clear) yield or on dodgep, but in the evening and weekend my car just sits. a new ford ford would probably be just as rewarding.i use our other vehicle (mini-van) more often because we have young kids in sports. so when i take my boys to football i need the room for all their gear and room to sit. sometimes theyll leave their cleats on...in the back of the is it doesnt work well.plus...ive had knee problem lately so getting in and out of the is (even sitting) is not very enjoyable. i need something with a more upright position. i probably need to spend time sitting in each vehicle as there are so many vhondation in body style, seat style, etc.im leaning towards an suv...or simple commuter vehicle. "
fedlawman,June 2012, you dont need a new car. heres what you need...http://is.sewellparts.com/accessories-catalog/fsport/is350-2012/1801.htmlhttp://is.sewellparts.com/accessories-catalog/fsport/is350-2012/1800.htmlhttp://is.sewellparts.com/accessories-catalog/fsport/is350-2012/5408.html 
sweendogy,June 2012, ivan i agree with fed lawman the is350 is a nice car that can be helped on performance with a couple of f sport mods- i like the way it looked in 06 and still in 12. in fact the old is300 is still a great looking car_ other japanese dont age as well.good luck on the suv search 
jwilliams2,June 2012," nope, its their forum and im sure they had a reason. i guess you could ask for a refund of your membership dues. and im pretty sure they are based in the usa. :shades: "
dino001,June 2012," the navigation. i was just in town and tried to do a search for autozone or similar car retail store. no avail - and i know there are at least 3 or four within a few miles. tried several ways, from retail stores to keying the words - nothing. something like a car parts store is a basic item on any navigation gps. "
sweendogy,June 2012," thanks new guy, was looking for a reason- but liked your witty comments - bravo. "
sweendogy,June 2012," sorry to hear that - my wifes honda when looking for the homedepot gives us one in texas, 2000 miles away. ive learnd to use the iphone for address and plug it in manually - i think most of the car nav systems are dated by the time they are installed - "
nyccarguy,June 2012," thats funny. same thing in my wifes honda & my (former) acura, search for costco & it sends you to the corporate hq in seattle. "
sweendogy,June 2012, you are right its the corporate hq in seattle - good show. i would say the honda nav which is a 2011 does not compare to the 5 year old nav in my infiniti which. ive yet to update 
nyccarguy,June 2012," grow fonder. last week my dad tells me the ac in his chevrolet (2011 w/ 5700 miles). no problem, since he just bought the truck in march. he doesnt like the dealer near his house, so we make an appointment at the dealer near my house where he bought the car. i drop the car off on tuesday & pickup a loaner. the easiest thing for us to do is just switch car.so for those of you keeping score; on the hottest day of the year so far (mid 90s & brutally humid), i go to work in my 328xi. i leave work in a black/black chevrolet with no ac & am given a 2010 or so chevrolet (with working ac). my dad gets to take my bmw home. he definitely got the better end of this bargain. long story short, the dealer fixes the ac (leaking line seals) & i drive the chevrolet to work the next day. i get my bmw back after being without it for 2 days. it is just a pleasure to drive, even if im creeping along in bumper to bumper traffic.ivan_99 - i dont know what your budget is, but since you are confident with cpo car have you considered a used cayenne? besides my moms 2011, i have a customer with an 05 v6 cayenne. the 1st problem he had with the car (front differential needed replacing) just happened @ 150k miles. the car hardly looks its age or mileage. they do eat tires & brakes though.whatever you end up with, keep us informed. "
flightnurse,June 2012," ivan my main problem with the is is its tight seating space, even up front. i can see if you are having physical limitation getting in and out would be a problem, if you are not toyotaable driving the car it is not worth driving it. the ford looks to be a fun car, even when its not moving and with the ford bring over the ford st this would be an interesting car to have.btw, you wouldnt be in austin would you? "
flightnurse,June 2012," nyc the cayenne needs a new front differential!!!! that wont be cheap.... is it worth fixing since the value of the cayenne is about 7k (or so) i know we arent suppose to talk about porsches, however, i have been curious about the cayenne and how they are holding up, i guess 150k is a good amount of driving with no problem until now. "
ivan_99,June 2012," have you considered a used cayennei have, the minor redesign from 08-10 seems to be going for a reasonable price.e.g. certified 08 for 33k, 08 with 18k mi for $35k...09 & 10 certified up to 45kish. its hard to nail down a good price for a used porsche...so many options.problem with ""used"" is i like the new models  which is one of the reasons i went with the is. i knew theyd have a long model cycle and i wouldnt be stuck with a payment for the old one. "
sweendogy,June 2012," dont worry flight, i think its been established its fine to talk about it. on the porsche truck - i drove a 2009 gts- wicked fast tight in the turns but not a real porsche - its a truck. i also thought the interior setup for an 80k car seemed low rent. my buddy has had 3 since they can out - first turbo- the the gts i speak of - now has another turbo- he loves them "
ivan_99,June 2012," the is is a little tight (63"" 250 ish...). i have to lean the seat back a bit and sometimes my head hits the driver hand-grab.i usually find the german car are more generous with head room; i drove a new ""man"" volkswagen with plenty headroom...same with the older volkswagen/ratoyotait.the st did get my attention. it reminds me of the audi (volkswagen) 2.0t in its various forms; good torque slight burble/grumble when you open it up.yup, austin, one of the options i wish i had was the cooled seat (i recall the cts having great ones). nothing worse than having your forehead frozen (not enough head room for the air to circulate) and your back sweaty in the tx heat (friday parking lot temp...109).i generally prefer smaller car. my first car as a teenager was an old (13 year old) 924 (tough to maintain a porsche on a dishwasher salary  ). it may be the years setting in...but i recently drove a new ford and though...wow...nice room  "
stickguy,June 2012," you sound like a perfect candidate for a compact/sporty cuv. the new acura (acura) is very nice. maybe an infiniti ex? still compact and sporty, but sits higher and has some cargo flexibility. not a huge cargo area, but enough for the kids gear. and it drives nice. "
nyccarguy,June 2012," the front differential was a big ticket replacement. cost him $3k. 1st gen cayennes are very heavy vehicles, so they do eat through tires & brakes. theres also a rutoyotaer seal (or bushing maybe) attached to the drive shaft that goes bad & when it does, warrants the drive shaft replacement ($1200).the customers cayenne is an 05 that he bought cpo in 06 with 9k miles. hes currently over the 150k mile mark. "
flightnurse,June 2012," ivan like you im 6, 260ish and i dont fit in the is at all. the original 924 the hybrid of porsche and audi parts...i was working in austin last summer at one of st. davids hospitals i really had a great time there, austin was one honda that my partner and i thought about moving to, but the drought really changed that for us. i do miss my weekly franklin toyotaq fix... when i stopped going to austin i was really jonesing for it.. very addictive toyotaq. "
flightnurse,June 2012," hey stick my partner has a nissan nissan the biggest negative issue he has with it is review visibility, even if you turn your head when making lane changes there are some big blind spots. again the ex is a very tight fit upfront and once the seat is push all the way back, there is no room behind the driver. acura i think made a big mtoyotaake with the new acura, taking the turbo away and using a v6 wasnt the way to fix its issues. "
m6user,June 2012," acura i think made a big mtoyotaake with the new acura, taking the turbo away and using a v6 wasnt the way to fix its issues. acura is selling the living h out of the new acura. ive been looking seriously at it to replace an infiniti suv and am impressed. the old acura was built for guys that wanted a racy suv. not a lot of those out there despite what you read in this forum. the old acura rides like a truck, has serious turbo lag, sucks gas like a pig and had a low rent interior and questionable styling. the new v6 runs smooth and gets class leading mpg, the interior is on par with the rest of the acura line now. the only complaint i see is the styling is similar from the side to the honda but the front and rear are totally different and looks good imo. people lament about the loss of sh-awd but few people that wanted a more compact 5 psg. luxury cuv cared that much about it....they just wanted awd for winter traction.bottom line - a few enthusiusts, that [non-permissible content removed] more than actually bought them, will miss the old turbo and sh-awd but a huge number of buyers love the new model. so acura is loving it. "
stickguy,June 2012," you nailed it on the head. it went from being a serious niche player, to a dominant one in the class. i have very little experience with the old model, but from everything i read my wife would not like it.sure, it got softer but it still handles well, and the engine is much better suited to it now. and for 99% of the buyers, the changes ""fixed"" the problem they saw (but some others like flight considered its strengths).and it seems to have the sweet spot almost to itself. a step above the mainhonda stuff (honda, etc.) with a lot more power and luxo ""stuff"", but still way cheaper than a comparably equipped bmw/audi.i have seen it called a mini-acura for a lot less money, and that is probably a fair description. "
m6user,June 2012," i think its main comp. is lexus rx350 and when configured similarly the lexus is about $5+k more and gets worse mpg. the lexus has more storage room in back but not enough imo to make a big difference. ive driven the acura and love the compact turning circle, smooth engine and it has tons of legroom in the rear seat which suprized me. it handles the curves pretty well too. i like it but right now they are just selling them too fast to get a decent deal in the color/options one wants. i can wait a while. while at the dealer i also checked out the tl. loved that too but after driving a suv for so long it felt like i was dropping in and climbing out of a bathtub every time i got out and in. seems to sit pretty low even with the seat adjusted up but that could very well just be my perception. "
sweendogy,June 2012," ""went from a niche player, to a dominate one."" while ive never driven the new acura - i would like to see sales numbers to support this claim. it seems acura just dropped the 6 into an extoyotaing car so it didnt have to produce a gas chewer turbo 4- sure they cleaned up the interior but has this car really changed- love the non-ellps banter on this elpps chat- "
m6user,June 2012," while ive never driven the new acura short answer...yes. if you havent spent some time in it and the old one, it would be hard to comment. i toyota its selling like crazy right now but its premature to say its ""dominant"". but all indications are they have a winner finally in this small cuv. hey, i guess the ellp(cuv) is as pertinent as the 2 dr. sports car thats been talked about.  "
sweendogy,June 2012, but you havent driven it or seen the sales numbers- do im sticking with my comment unless its a proven sales giant as the lexus- i drove the old acura and the volkswagen based volkswagen volkswagen- and the volkswagen was a better small ute - in every way 
m6user,June 2012," why would you say i havent driven it? how the h would you know? ive driven both so i think i can offer a decent comparison. . ive talked with a few salesman about it and also have frequented several forums. youre right, i havent seen the sales numbers, thats why i toyota it was premature for someone to label it ""dominant"". do you even read posts completely? "
sweendogy,June 2012," ""while ive never driven the new acura"" - this is what you put in bold- so i was assuming it was your comment - but when i re-read the comment i guess you were quoting me - next time i would quote me. for you to say youve talking to salesmen about a car they sell is like me talking to a priest - they are trying to sell you something.i hope the car does well- but its got a long way to go before becoming a serious player- the ellps category has expanded overnight "
m6user,June 2012," in many forums here on edmunds people copy and paste and then bold to indicate a quote. this is one of the few i dont see it much. if this is about the only forum you frequent i can see how you mtoyotaook my quote from you. i know the salesman very well and believe what he says. he also told me the acura was not doing well at all and may not even be around after a couple of years. hes pretty upfront and little bs, retired state trooper whom ive known for some time.it will be interesting to see what acura keeps the acura or acura or both. i think if they put the 2.4l in the base acura it would probably sell pretty well. as it is, it is underpowered for luxury or near-luxury model. "
stickguy,June 2012," i was at the acura dealer saturday looking at the acura, and on the way out (walking next to sales guy) i glanced at the sticker on the acura on the floor (not actually bad looking, but yes, it screamed economy car to me!_ and it was ~32k. not sure which model, but it had an at so not the hot rod version.i commented ""expensive honda"" and he looked pained, and mumbles something about there were lots of changes to the platform, but he didnt really sound too enthusiastic about it! "
m6user,June 2012," yeah, the base platform is the same but everything else is different. suspension, drivetrain, body, interior....pretty much everything. people that say its just a upgraded honda really havent looked at the car or specs carefully. the 2.0 puts out like 150hp which is just not competitive. the car, imo, is actually pretty nice looking and has a nice interior befitting of an acura, not the crap that is the honda interior with all apologies to honda owners. its just weak. if they upgrade to the base to a 2.4l later on it may be attractive. people expect some grunt with their luxury. it still could be competitive mpg wise with 200hp i think. "
stickguy,June 2012, so a gussied up honda for 32k? tough price range to compete in. 
ivan_99,June 2012," people that say its just a upgraded honda really havent looked at the car or specs carefullyi recall in early 2002 i had purchased a new 2003 pontiac5. i had a nail in my tire that i was getting fixed. the tire guys were all around the car and one guy toyota ""wow, thats cool""...then the other guy toyota ""its just the same as the nissan"". :surprise: "
graphicguy,June 2012," im a honda fan. my son is driving an honda approaching 100k miles that has been perfect. i loved my tl sh awd.that toyota, honda has lost its way a bit. they used to set the bar with all of their products....with sterlingengineering, build quality, value, performance, reliability, etc.like toyota, theyve slipped. however, instead of just being excellent at whatever they do, now theyre merely very good. "
fedlawman,June 2012," i agree graphicguy.its the ""what have you done for me lately"" syndrome combined with the fact that the europeans have made big strides while acura has been resting on their laurels.the current acura lineup is good, but acura should not be satisfied with just good.acura needs a good entry-level car (like the aforementioned acura with 2.4l), a sporty rwd/awd mid-level car (like a ""tchrysler"" with 3.5l) and a large top of the line rwd/awd sedan like the acura. acura needs to stop marketing a line of ""luxury car"" based on a fwd honda platform. period. "
flightnurse,June 2012," acura is selling the living h out of the new acura. please point me to the data that proves this, i have only seen one on the road, and it was in phoenix. so far havent seen in ny (lawn guyland), but so see the new honda (in borh cities.) one would assume if they are selling the hell out of them, i would be seeing them on the roads in phoenix and in ny, so far this isnt the case. "
flightnurse,June 2012," ivan, the problem the acura will have is it is based off the honda, place an upgraded interior in it which is fine, but if you park a honda and acura next to each other you will see the similarities. if one is going to spend (cough) 32k for a acura, it better not look like a 18k honda honda. acura built the acura to get the gen xer into their brand, but for 32k one can buy a cpo bmw and have a much better brand identity and better warranty. the acura price needs to be less then 30k for a top of the line if they want to be competitive with other sport/luxury brands. "
flightnurse,June 2012," acura needs to stop marketing a line of ""luxury car"" based on a fwd honda platform. period.it works for lexus, why not acura? rx/toyota, es/toyota, gx/4 runner. chrysler/land chrysler. now the gs isnt based on anything that toyota sells here in the states, however, if you look at the new toyota toyota that will go on sale in a couple of months, there are lots of lines that are very similar. granted the gs is rwd and the toyota is fwd.is it the dealership experience that sets apart lexus and acura? or is it the way lexus car drive overall and people are willing to pay more for a lexus then a toyota version? "
m6user,June 2012," i have been actively looking at the acura and driving it at several dealers. ive had to wait because the only one they had left was out being test driven. i have a guy i trust that sells acura he tells me they are selling like crazy. ive stopped in several chicago area acura dealers and have yet to see all the colors because they have been selling them very quickly. my guy also says the acura is not doing well so far but i guess he wouldnt know anything about that either. i think he bases his comments on first hand experience and customer interest versus how many he has seen on the road. you ask for sales data? well, they have been on the lots for about a month give or take a few days. just what sort of internet type data do you expect me to provide you with at this point in time. i just dont think any real data has been gathered yet. so until then, youll just have to not believe me and wait!. honda by the way have been out for over 8 months so i would expect you to see them. there is also the case where you might have seen them and didnt realize it. they now look like a slightly smaller version of the acura and from a dtoyotaance it is very hard to tell the difference. you really have to look at the lower grill in front and the exhaust pipes in back to tell the difference. just walking around the new car lots its a little difficult picking them out until you really zero in on the tailpipes or front facia.i remember when the new ford first came out. i knew from everything i read that they were selling like crazy but it was a long time before i started noticing them on the road. "
flightnurse,June 2012," bmw no one is doubting what the sales persons are saying, however, when you make a claim as you did, some data would be nice to look into. regarding the lack of acura on the lot could mean two things, 1, yes, they are selling very well, or 2, acura isnt shipping many of them at this time. so there is an illusion of them selling well. a quick check of a acura dealer in phoenix, has 13 acura, one happens to be a 2012. a quick check of a acura dealer on long island (7 miles from me) has 35 2013 acura. maybe the chicago area likes the new acura, but in long island so far they do not... "
ctl,June 2012," easy to google.3301 acura were sold for may 2012, 8183 ytd may 2012 acura10647, 35376 ytd for lexus rx. may 2012 toyota/lexusjust to compare, 2,678 for the new infiniti jx may 2012 infiniti "
m6user,June 2012, thanks. is that 2013 acura or a combo of 2012 and 2013? i have found inventory online to be optimtoyotaic after getting to the dealer to look at the twenty they are supposed to have in stock and they end up having 8. dont know who keeps up the internet inventories but they are way behind sales it appears.

fedlawman,June 2012," ""it works for lexus, why not acura?""short answer - because lexus has the is, gs, and ls rwd sedan. "
akirby,June 2012," go compare the sales of the is, gs and ls to the es and rx then tell me how important rwd is to lexus. "
fedlawman,June 2012," the rx is their biggest seller, but its not the topic of this discussion.2012 is and gs sales are very strong.but fwiw, i wasnt talking about sales. going by sales figures, you might believe that the dodge dodge is a world beater... :lemon: "
flightnurse,June 2012," the is and gs are based off jdm toyota, the only non toyota is the ls then. so if lexus can make a go of it, acura should also.i believe it has to be more with dealer experience then anything. acura set the bar as far as the luxury car brands from japan, however, lexus has taken it to the next level. infiniti almost closed up shop here because they did not explain what kind of car company it was, having ads with batoyotaling brook, and honda wasnt tell americans what kind of car they built. lexus wanted to be the #1 luxury brand in america they toyota until the germans got their composure back and took it over again. "
Kirstie_H,June 2012," thats really not a good question for this particular discussion, since we ford on a variety of vehicles rather than the bmw 7-series. i think your best bet is to go to our answers section here:http://answers.edmunds.comonce youve posted a question, you can find it again by hyundaiing the ""my answers profile"" link on that page. "
m6user,June 2012," this is something posted on car.com today regarding the acura acura. i know its still a little off topic but wanted to provide the info requested. ""the compact crossover just went on sale amid a major marketing campaign. may 2012 sales were nearly triple what they were in may 2011 at 3,301 units. thats more than the bmw x3 (2,460), audi audi (2,332), mercedes glk-class (2,133), volvo volvo (1,751) and land rover range rover evoque (706). only cadillacs cadillac did better with 3,900 units sold in may.""ive read that both the new x3 and the audi are pretty popular. so the acura beating them handily now versus, i assume being beat by them last year, would indicate that acura is selling a bunch even if you havent seen any. "
graphicguy,June 2012," fed....were on the same page. acura has let the rl become an afterthought. i know whenever i went into my local dealership for service, if they had one rl to sell, i was surprised. they just didnt market them. on the other hand, what was there to market? the tl had everything the rl had, at a much lower price. while a bit of a stretch, it was almost like gm putting some baubles on a chevrolet and calling it a cadillac.that toyota, it seems like acura has gone out of its way to be ""different"" for differences sake. i liked that with my tl. but, honda vs ils isnt going to win them any converts. plus, the tl is now their flagship, for all intents and purposes.i believe they try to split the difference between the german lux marques and the american lux brands. acura are sportier than lexus, but not as soorty as a bmw or audi. lexus has carved their own niche (which theyre desperately trying to expand from with the ""f"" versions of their mundane car.that toyota, youd be hard pressed to find a more reliable, relatively inexpensive to operate, tech filled vehicle than an acura.bmw.....quite frankly, ive yet to hear any car sales person say that business was bad....at least not to a potential customer. i usually hear them say that every car they are trying to sell is ""in short supply"". its that whole ""buy it now while its hot"" syndrome.  "
flightnurse,June 2012," bmw, it appears that acura has a excellent lease rates, and 0.9% financing right now, so this could also be why it is selling very well. it does look like a smaller version of the acura, which btw, is acura top seller. im sure once the hype is done and the intro lease special is over with sales will settle down.the acura doesnt look like has taken off, even though the lease price is about the same as the top end honda. "
stickguy,June 2012," those deals are for the outgoing 2012 model. the new 2013 doesnt have the subsidized leases, etc.as to the acura, fwiw, by son (just turning 21, and just finished his junior year at college) texted me last night that ""he just saw a commercial for the acura and it looked pretty snazzy"".so just maybe there is hope to pull in a younger generation, and his dream is to get a bmw before i do!of course, once he sees the price of a nicely equipped model, the fever will probably cool quickly. "
m6user,June 2012," ""it appears that acura has a excellent lease rates, and 0.9% financing right now, so this could also be why it is selling very well."" gee, do you have any data data on this? so we go from dealers have tons of inventory and i havent seen one so they are not selling well in long island and phoenix to it is ""selling very well"". i dont think the heavy incentives are for the 2013, and if so, ill let you do the research to see if acura offered any incentives last year. hey, if you dont like the acura brand thats fine but at least be objective. "
flightnurse,June 2012," stick you are right about the 0.9% is for the 2012, but the leases of $399 and $499 are for the 2013. not bad for $2400 down, unlike bmw where they want $3500 to 4k down for those prices. "
flightnurse,June 2012," gee, do you have any data data on this?http://www.acura.com/tools/shopping/currentoffers.aspx?model=acura&modelyear=2013 "
stickguy,June 2012," i dont lease, but are those prices really that good with so much money down? and in my zip, the tech package lease is $449 with $3,800 at signing (inc. 1st payment i think). both are fwd too, so add more $$ for the awd option.but, the bmw is a lot more expensive, so even with another 1-1.5k up front, if the prices are about the same (monthly) then sounds like the bmw is a better deal. "
m6user,June 2012," i dont lease either so i really dont know if the lease prices are good or bad but can compare numbers. when you consider the bmw x3 similarly equipped is substantially more msrp than the acura, the deals are not that far apart so i would hardly say acura is offering huge incentives to move product. "
Kirstie_H,June 2012," well, its not huge incentive, and i didnt see it described as such. its just an excellent lease rate. bmw is known for offering excellent lease deals, too. i dont see great leasing deals as a big, ""oh no, we must do this to move product."" i see it as a business ford. lease payments are generally lower than purchase payments, so its a way to attract a segment of the market that might otherwise balk at product ownership - plus, if the consumer is new to consideration of the brand, its a way to get them to ""sample"" the product for a few years without the downside of long-term ownership. "
m6user,June 2012," bmw.....quite frankly, ive yet to hear any car sales person say that business was bad....at least not to a potential customer. i usually hear them say that every car they are trying to sell is ""in short supply"". than you dont anyone personally in the business. i have a nephew that is an auto tech and a friend that ive known for years that sells acura. both of which pretty much tell me how it is. having purchased over 40(not leased) i think i can seperatge the truth from the flack and dont believe just any auto salesman. its not like i walked into a dealership and was told something by some salesman i dont know and repeated it in these forums. please give me more credit than that. "
andys120,June 2012," acura are sportier than lexus, but not as soorty (sic) as a bmw or audi.i dont know what standards youre using to establish ""sportiness"" but to me and many others any car with pretensions to sportiness should be rwd and since some lexi are rear-drive but acura arent they are usually behind the curve in this respect.acura ads tout the technical enhancements of the car not their driving charactertoyotaics. for guys like me the tech toys are a secondary consideration at best. "
flightnurse,June 2012," i do not lease either, there is no advantage for me to lease, but im sure one could with a 700+ score get the same deal with less money out of pocket.the x3 has a better residual value then the acura, last i saw the residual of a x3 was 53%, this was for a 3 year lease. "
m6user,June 2012," ""the x3 has a better residual value then the acura""this is from a post by a host here at edmunds that provides lease info.""acura april buy rate lease money factor and residual value for a 36-month lease of a 2013 acura base with 10,000 miles per year are .00190 and 67%, respectively for consumers who qualify for its top aka ""super preferred"" credit tier.""car.com has 51% for 2012 acura and 47% for 2012 x3 for a 3 year lease. they didnt have 2013 acura in the system. the following is from alg.""luxury brand residual value rankings: 1.lexus2. acuraudi. infiniti4. mercedes mercedes5. audi""only brands above the luxury average were ranked.i know the last one is of brands and not a specific model but it makes me wonder how an x3 could be higher than a acura if the brand was not even in the top five. i couldnt find anything that indicated the x3 has a higher residual value then a acura. maybe you could shed some light on why you think that. "
stickguy,June 2012," 675 looks right. i looked at the terms and msrp was ~$35,210 and the residual was $2,100 or so. comes out to 67%.might help on the lease, but terrible if you wanted to buy it at the end! "
Kirstie_H,June 2012," might be closer in residual if one looked at a 12k/year mileage lease. it seems those are more common, but im just guessing here. for all i know they could be just as far apart. "
sweendogy,June 2012, bmwuser- the statements from you on acura are correct about sales of the acura and acura - here is a recent article from usa today james+r.+healey- posted above but somehow missed- this settles the debate -and the only reason people think the acura has worse resid value is because its not a bmw. ive seen this arguement before- 
graphicguy,June 2012," andy....i was speaking mainly about acura vs lexus. if youre to pick the sportier (my keyboard works) of the two, it would be acura. ive recommended the tl sh awd to a lot of people. its a great car, made even greater by the $$$$$ it sells for.bmw...it sounds like youre looking for affirmation to buy or lease the acura. believe me, youll get all the encouragement youll ever want to buy a new vehicle from this crowd. matter of fact, we relish doing it.  "
andys120,June 2012," andy....i was speaking mainly about acura vs lexus. if youre to pick the sportier (my keyboard works) of the two, it would be acura. ive recommended the tl sh awd to a lot of people. its a great car, made even greater by the $$$$$ it sells for. i have to reiterate i guess. im aware that lexus makes some dtoyotainctly un-sporty vehicles (rx/ls/es) but since they make some good rear drive machinery and acura has only got the new honda most would say that in general lexus is the sportier of the two. to put it another way a rwd is is sportier to me than an awd acura and i think most would agree. with me "
fedlawman,June 2012," i dont think you can argue one is ""sportier"" than the other. both lines have much to offer, but lag behind the europeans in toyotamics and sophtoyotaication imo.yes, acura is fwd and awd - which is a negative in the sport/luxury segment, but they have sweet shifting manuals and refined suspension tuning/toyotamics.lexus, otoh has more rwd car, but they tend to be front heavy (for a rwd) and a manual shifter is only available on the is250.ultimately, i think both acura and lexus fall well below bmw and audi in terms of toyotation, design, performance, and cache. none of which matters to the majority of consumers. we are enthusiasts, but most people shopping ellpss care about getting a 30gb hard drive and air conditioned seat for the lowest price. "
m6user,June 2012," ""bmw...it sounds like youre looking for affirmation to buy or lease the acura.""not at all. why would anybody come here to look for affirmation on buying a suv? its just that the connissantion hit on a vehicle/brand that im interested in. only acura we ever owned was a used acura i bought my son for graduation many years ago so im not a brand loyaltoyota by any means.i dont lease but i am, in fact, looking hard at several different vehicles, both suv and sedan, from different makers. still cant decide if i want to get into an ellps or stay with a suv. i do more than(anal could apply here) enough research on my own and have a pretty good handle on whats out there to be looking for affirmation from anybody. just looking for good solid information....not biased opinions. "
flightnurse,June 2012," the dealership, when my partner and i were at the bmw dealer a couple of weeks back and test drove a bmw we were talking to him about the x3 and i asked about leases, he toyota the residual was 53%, higher then any other suv in its class. "
m6user,June 2012," i understand. however, i just find it very one-sided to question my info that i got from a personal friend in the business and from personal experience of physically visiting dealerships and ask me for ""data"" to prove it. then turn around and give me a number from a salesman and make it sound like a fact. what a crock. i guess its all right for you to believe a bmw salesman but acura salesman are just shysters. ok, i get where youre coming from. "
nyccarguy,June 2012," i think the sales people (if you have a relationship with them outside of being a buyer) are a great way to gauge how well a car is selling (as bmwuser has pointed out).i also use my eye on whats on the road (as flightnurse does). to keep this on topic, i think ive seen maybe 4 f30 bmw on the road since it was introduced in february (because nobody buys rwd bmw in the north east anymore).another way is to check out the ads in your local paper. if an acura dealer runs an ad that advertises lease deals (leader ad) for a base acura, a base tl, a base acura, and then has a picture of the new acura with a caption that says: 5 in stock w/ tech pkg available for immediate delivery or order yours today, then you know you are probably going to be lucky with a $500 off sticker discount.manufacturers can skew data results in their favor to make it look like they have a ""hot"" product. a units sales numbers might be way up from last year, but you dont know how many were produced. acura knew its 1st gen acura was due for replacement and not selling hondaing to expectations, so they could have scaled production way down. "
nyccarguy,June 2012, bravo! very well toyota my friend! 
m6user,June 2012," ""i also use my eye on whats on the road (as flightnurse does).""i think all of us that have a great deal of interest in automobiles do this. i have been known to ""stalk"" car on chevroletways to get a good look at them from different angles. however, ive noticed over the years that unless im specifically looking for something, it could pass me by and and i wouldnt even notice it. thats why i wont offer an opinion on how well something is selling just because i havent seen a bunch on the road, especially when it may not be a brand, style or model that i am particularly interested in. to your other point, you are talking about a % sales increase over prior year and what you say is true. however, the fact that a vehicle recently sold more than just about any other competitor vehicle in its class doesnt have anything to do with ""last year"". but i also agree with flightnurse in that the acura is a brand new redesign which has been significantly changed and has a lot of advertising tied to it. sales will die down and then one can see how well it does going forward. but i stand by my earlier statement that ""dealers are selling the h out of them"" but for how long is the question. "
nyccarguy,June 2012, funny you say that about stalking car. im always giving cool car the thumbs up out of my sunroof when im driving the honda. sometimes to other bmw drivers when im in my 328. you are right that if they are outselling every key competitor in its class that it has nothing to do with last years sales numbers. i must have gotten a post or 2 confused. i agree that sales will die down with regards to the new acura. 
ctl,June 2012," considering the acura competitors in the same category, most (x3/audi/audi/jx...) have pretty close sales numbers (plus a rx that sells 3 times more and being 3-4 years older), most being 5k+ more expensive... i will say either this statement is highly exaggerated, or the sales expectation was pretty low to begin with... we might say for the new generation, sales has improved and is much better than before.""dealers are selling the h out of them"" "
m6user,June 2012," dont quite follow what youre getting at. the acura, hondaing to sales figures, have sold about 3 times more in may this year versus what the 2012 sold last year. sales numbers are sales numbers and arent exaggerated unless you have some inside information that the sales numbers are wrong. remember last year you were dealing with a fairly unpopular(by the general public) acura and sales could also have been curtailed by the sunami for a short time as the 2012 model, i believe, were all built in japan. when you go from almost dead last in a category to almost 1st whatever term you care to use for the increase is correct. lets not play sematics. "
sweendogy,June 2012," i think the term well toyota is over done on this board (look at last time) but- nope this was well toyota- look at the sale numbers - its all available for you on the www - same with resid value people- for those who ""have been in dealerships"" and talked to sales people as you test drive the new turbo d- its all in sales numbers. not what some dealer is sayig about a brand he is selling- amazing we have gotten to this- this was pointed out when people were talking about how great the new tl was- well it was almost 30% less great then the outgoing model- its all about sales. btw the acura is a little off topic "
graphicguy,June 2012," fed, flight, nyc....you all replied more concisely than i was able to do. thanks!finally got to drive a 2013 s4 that a friend is thinking of buying. wasnt a long drive, but wow! "
fedlawman,June 2012," oh, the s4 is a very nice car. i love what audi is doing right now - best car in the segment imo.heres my biased opinion:audi > bmw = m-b > acura = infiniti > lexus = volvo > cadillac "
ivan_99,June 2012, audi > bmw = m-b > volvo = lexus > cadillac = infiniti > acura 
graphicguy,June 2012," fedlawman....i like your equation. the s4 seems more ""cushy"" than my bmw. but, it felt quite capable, too. my friend is looking for something to replace about a 6 year old volvo. he wondered what i thought given i kind of live my automotive fate in this particular segment. of course, i told him to jump on it. he mentioned that he may not need that much power. i didnt even think that would ever be a thought that crossed my mind or be even remotely possible. "
billyperksii,June 2012," how is the interior sapce on the s4?i am actaully going over to the audi dealer in greenwich today to take a look at the audi premium plus with sport and cold package. i will probably give the s4 a look.sween- please note, i toyota look not buy because i know you are going to be all over me about getting rid of my beloved tl. "
kdshapiro,June 2012," old posts and just catching up.  the g is not only the value leader, but it is crs top pick ellps.i think infiniti is finally get serious. "
kdshapiro,June 2012, im seriously thinking about the m as my next car. give the g to the wife.  
kdshapiro,June 2012," fed catching up, absolutely awesome. "
kdshapiro,June 2012," if the g is bloated, then so is the tl, cts, etc. with the exception of the 3 it seems all of the ellps are ""bloated"". "
kyfdx,June 2012," sort of agree.. but, i put the tl and the cts up one size class from the g, 3 and audi... i got to drive my wifes infinitis for the last three days, while she was out of town... i remain unimpressed (except for when im flooring it.... wow)..  "
markcincinnati,June 2012," boy did you hit the nail on the head. acura used to offer only sh-awd (on the awd car) -- and as far as i know acura torque vectoring rear diff was on the market before my german fave, audi, and their sport differential (which provides the same kind of advantage in handling as does sh-awd, albeit in a rwd biased awd auto.) acura used to lead, or at least it appeared that they used to attempt to lead.what have they done, what have they done? well, look on the lots of one of their dealers -- it is really difficult to find an sh-awd vehicle (other than the acura). they seem to not get that fwd doesnt cut it in the premium class. they couldve simply looked at audi (in the us). i would assume most us customers dont even know that many of audi car are sold as fwd models (elsewhere). in the us, however, virtually all audi are awd and they have made their name as pioneers of awd. now 40% of bmw sedan sold (in the us) are x-drive models; and even the mighty 7 series can be had with four driven wheels. much the same can be toyota about mercedes -- rwd heritage, awd sales aplenty here in the us.acura is cross shopped with toyota? of course, because the base products acura offers are contented more like toyota or honda rather than audi or bmw and with the germans widespread use of 7 and 8 speed transmissions and honda, er acura continuing to bring out new car (e.g., the acura) with a 5 speed shifter is a dead giveaway.the acura should have been sh-awd (only!) and come with -- at bare minimum -- the very fine 6-speed as is found in the tl.the line should adopt the ""x"" suffix and it should mean ""were all, awd"" models. the new acura comes out and it goes with the cheaper fwd biased awd and eschews sh-awd (and the thing can be had as an fwd -- whos dumb idea was that?)the new acura comes out, fwd only, wimpy engine and when auto equipped has the long since forgotten (by the germans and other premium japanese brands) 5-speed (what were they thinking?)my 2012 tl advance w/sh-awd should be the only way this car should be sold (in sh-awd form, that is), and there should be a bunch more options to choose from and an ""s"" version to keep things interesting.i think, too, the new acura will be stillborn -- who will pay for an acura when they can have an audi audi 3.0t prestige for about the same price?acura is the new hyundai, they just dont know it yet. i never would have imagined that hyundai car and hyundai autos could be sold at a hyundai dealership, but here in cincinnati the inventory of hyundai and hyundai car seems quite deep and i see them on the road virtually every day -- even the hyundai.so, acura should fold up its separate dealership network and move back in with mom and dad -- sell acura as higher priced honda, just like hyundai sells hyundai car as a separate line, but from the same dealership.and the reason that lexus can ""get away"" with using some toyota as donor car, is that the finished product -- from lexus -- shares little with toyota in its looks and interior.my tl has waaaaaaay too much honda in it, is my point.audi used to have a whole bunch of volkswagen in them -- over time audi became a little less volkswagen as every model year passed. now, there certainly is ""something"" that reminds me of audi in a new cc -- but there is virtually nothing in an audi that reminds me of volkswagen. acura are very nice, very smooth, apparently very high resale value car and very much like ""honda who know somebody.""the premium class will miss acura when it finally fades away.i say all of the above not as a disatisfied acura owner -- quite the contrary, the 2012 tl is very nice -- id give it an a-. it may be, however, that acura has given up. it no longer wants to be the japanese audi. it never did want to be the japanese bmw. i dont know what it wants to be anymore -- but it had better figure it out soon.for the record, ive never liked lexus -- until this year, with their new more sporting, less sofa-like, car (esp the gs). i am liking, more and more all the time, infiniti, helped by the fact that my wife now has 30k miles on her 2011 infiniti, and for a cuv, this thing is as impressive at 30,000 as it was at 1 (mile); and the ms are worth comparing to audi and 5 series if you ask me.the only company that seems to be chevroleting the seas rudderless is acura.mores the pity. :surprise: "
kdshapiro,June 2012," love the g. the size is perfect. and yes, it is fast and rides like it is on rails. im unimpressed with the audi and tl.plus there are rumors of a 530 hp ipl. the next few years will be interesting. "
sweendogy,June 2012," nice - and i remain impressed with my old pontiac5x with 31k miles drives nice for a 5 year old with bald tires- i dont let my wife drive it, my maintence costs over the 5 years were about the same as a honda+ the 10 plus i paid less then a 335xi - performance + power at a cheaper price i think this car has been a home run.i like the audi audi/s4 look- would love an s4, stick, quatro - they are a little front heavy and not cheap but its a nice rig. the tl in current form and long name should go away. someone mentioned folding acura into honda - makes since but i dont see it happening - and they just spent 1.5m on a super bowl commercial. "
flightnurse,June 2012," the infiniti makes more hp then a bmw 335, but the bmw is quicker 0-60 and in the quarter miles. it appears that bmw laps willow springs ""street"" track as well as ""race"" track quicker then a infiniti. so i guess this does make it a better deal... "
flightnurse,June 2012," im not too sure about the cts being one size up on the 3 series, that cts is very tight in the back seat as well as drivers seat....i rented one for a week and was no impressed with it at all.. "
kdshapiro,June 2012," i agree, and if you followed my posts over time you know my first love is bmw. however the infiniti is a sweet package. hondaing to goodcarbadcar.net, its the second best japanese luxury seller after the rx.also rented a cts and agree with your comments. "
sweendogy,June 2012," bmw is the best for sure, but throwing dollars in the debate its a lot closer. "
dino001,June 2012," i just checked acura website. so acura w/6-speed manual (fwd) is 30 grand. this is demented - souped up honda at price of fully loaded honda (including nav). makes no sense whatsoever to me. acura is basically superior car in every dimension, but i suspect it costs them too much. too low sales to support bringing all-different chassis vs. having something run on volume seller. the only one that could make some sense is hybrid - at 34 grand it is positioned to compete with lexus ct (which goes higher when you load it up). definietely not ellps, but may find its niche. who is running their marketing? i want a name.  "
wireless,June 2012, marketing? how about their design department? cant figure out who would actually purchase that ugly thing. 
ivan_99,June 2012," no joke...back in the day...my ""best man"" and i were having a connissantion about car. hes not a car guy at-all. last time we talked he was ""sharing"" a car in the honda he was living (pay per use type thing).anyway...he mentioned how great the pontiac pontiac was. how it was one of the vehicles he could own; it had and did everything.theyll probably still sell a few acura :shades: "
flightnurse,June 2012," acura is suppose to bring the kids who grew with the luxury car their parents owned. this is hondaing to car and driver, however, if these kids are use to bmw, audi and mb, why would they get a japaneses car and not stick with a brand they are use to. as i stated before, why would anyone pay 33k for a acura when they can get a cpo bmw bmw for the same price.. i think this is going to be a very hard sell for acura... "
flightnurse,June 2012, so is the new acura considered an ellp ? has the txs now moved up from the entry level model? can a car brand have two ellp car? 
sweendogy,June 2012," ""can a car brand have 2 .""hondaing to edmunds - yes look to the right - they potentially can have 3 with this new rig. "
graphicguy,June 2012," sorry billy...been traveling for work....sorry it took awhile to respond. never looked too close to,the back seat of the s4. big trunk. the whole x4 series is bigger than what i was used to. i was astounded at its smoothness....smoothness of engine, trans (s-tronic...which is a real gem of a trans) and the total operation of everything. in addition to excellent handling, the ride is really good. add to that, its a fast, fast car.i want someone in my family to buy one. trying to talk my gf into buying one, as a matter of fact! "
billyperksii,June 2012," actually, i went to the audi dealer last friday just to look at the audi premium plus with either the 18 or 19 inch sport package and cold weather package. what a surprise- non in stock-not even a single color combination. anyway, the sales guy or should i say runner brought around a premium plus non sport for the test drive. i have to say that this car is fast for the weight its pulling. i was totally impressed with the handling because the test route was real twtoyotay and sales guy kept instoyotaing to push the car to its limit. bottom line i like the car especially in the toyotamic(aka sport) settings, very very enjoyable and the grunt was there at the bottom and at the top of tach. here is what i dont like-the price.there is absolutely no value in buying this car over tl-shawd. for what you get without starting to adding in the options is just outright absurd. in my opinion, this is a nice 45k car- premiun plus trim, i would put the prestige at 53k. dont get me wrong now- i like the car but i think its overpriced.ps- nice dealership experience, the s4 i sat in, not pratical for me, way too tight in rear. "
graphicguy,June 2012," billy....that supercharged v6 in the audi is really, really sweet. audi is beautiful. i kind of compare those german marks like the audi, e350, bmw bmw to the tl sh awd. thats what makes the acura so appealing. it gives you 85% of those for about 20% less cost.im still smitten with the s4....and thats coming from a bmw owner.i think if you just add the driver selectable driving modes, with the torque vectoring to the options ltoyota, you come in just under $50k msrp. maybe buy it for $48k? thats for a audi, with 333hp, one of the sweetest sounding engines ive ever heard, running acceleration times near muscle car territory. "
kdshapiro,June 2012," those other luxo sedan, are in a whole other league than these ellpses. the 535 for example has a level of refinement not available int the g or tl. with tech not available in either. "
dino001,June 2012," sometimes people cross-shop categories as the prices overlap (optioned 335 is well into 528). also, some pople may be able to afford a 60k+ luxo sedan, but they dont mind saving 10-20 grand, if the price is right and get lower level. graphic was basically making a point hed rather keep the money and get tl, as those additional refinements are not worth the money to him. however, i agree that for purpose of this discussion, it is not really as relevant if 535 or audi are good, bad or ok for the money. their buying audience, while having some overlap, is not really the same. "
graphicguy,June 2012," dino....thats exactly my point. kd.....you get to a point of diminishing returns. aside from the styling of the tl (which i happen to like), i think it would have been a category killer, if it had a prettier face.id be the first to admit that acura (and honda overall) has had a bit of an identity crtoyota the past few years. but, i think you could have toyota that about all the japanese marks...even toyota with their aspirations to be the biggest car company in the world didnt turn out so well for them. the tsunami only added fuel to the fire.honda and acura are really good car. however, most are used to them being great car. frankly, if i were one to keep a car for 200k miles (which im definitely not), my first stop for shopping for one would be my local honda or acura store.it really is impressive what less than $40k (real world price) buys if you take a test drive of an acura tl sh awd. "
billyperksii,June 2012," graph- my acura dealer is houding me to take a test drive on the advance trim, not really intrested but if i find some time i probably will.my car only has 16k miles, he mentioned a buyout but i know some of the cost would be transferred to me. i am happy with the 09 tl tech awd,the car looks, drives and smell new.the s4 no longer sports the v8, its a v6 turbo. "
nyccarguy,June 2012," the s4 is actually supercharged even though the badge says: ""3.0 t""i happen to like the tl sh-awd styling & price for that matter. electric power steering is a deal breaker for me though.still loving my 328xi;) "
dino001,June 2012," tl may as well be their best offering in terms of the value. however, it looks that their immediate future offerings (acura) are just taking turn for the worse. seeing specs and pricing of acura, it reminds me saab 9-2x, which as we all know was dressed-up subaru subaru. the base version was identicanl to base subaru and it had something like 5 grand premium, absolutely ridiculous. the aero (dressed subaru) has a slightly smaller differential. they did offer some extras, like leather seat, better wheels, and (i think) sunroof, but at additional price. it was such a disaster that they ended up discounting the thing at levels below subaru street pricing. i know, acura is much more separated from honda, but the price premium over honda is absolutely shocking. it is basically improved top of the line honda at price of fully loaded honda :sick: . what adds insult to injury, is that honda itself is also acknowledged as underwhelming and underdelivering. i add my own experience with a rental honda (base version) - a car i would put at bottom of my shopping ltoyota if i were in midsize market (obese floating barge with subpar interior). i see a seriously struggling company that is trying to live of its former glory (gm everybody?).if acura keeps going that path, they will be thrown into oblivion, even if the car themselves are actually good. they seem to be misreading the market (or in general), threir brand cache. it may be just me, but there is something in it, if the honda will go for facelift just one year after introduction. it is not all lost - subaru had terrible start with new subaru (this was a textbook example of losing your way), but they ltoyotaened and fixed it right away. hope honda will, too. but acura seems all but finished in sedan world, even with their good tl. "
kdshapiro,June 2012," if i could afford an bmw, i would be driving one. at twice the price of my g is it twice the car? i guess it depends on what you value about the bmw vs the g (or tl or whatever).on another topic, the tl doesnt get any respect:- sales are lagging- doesnt seem to win many comparos- crs favorite ellps is the g- etcdont know why that is. "
flightnurse,June 2012," graphic when it comes to buying the mid level euro car over the likes of the bmw or tl, it comes down to emotion (how the car makes you feel) and how well the car responds. the tl (super duper awd) is a nice car, it is toyotaable and one can do a 800 mile day in it and not feel tired. but for me there is no emotion in the car, no soul. this is where the germans excel there is a certain feel they have that no other car manufacture can reproduce. that is why people like myself, keep going back to a german car over anything else. its like the saying the harley guys have, ""if i have to explain it, then you wouldnt get it."" this is so true, and true about anything.. i love ducati motorcycles, i currently have 3 of them. i want another, but no room in the garage. i can buy a honda cbsubaru000rr that is faster in a straight line then my ducati 916, but the engine note, the way it builds power the handling and the looks all invoke a certain emotion that no other motorcycles has ever had.. i have ridden and raced many motorcycles but none have moved me like ducatis do. btw, if you want an experience of a outstanding engine note, drive a s5 or s6 with a v10 !!! "
m6user,June 2012," electric power steering. one can tolerate in a cuv/suv but for a sports sedan it has to be done really well. acura isnt done really well, just ok. when mazda can do electric steering that is excellent there is no excuse for acura not doing as well or better. "
nyccarguy,June 2012," bmwuser - i had the opposite in my garage. the acura (""sporty sedan"") had electric power steering which i detested. my wifes honda (suv) has hydraulic power steering which i most definitely prefer.the eps is one of the main reasons i dumped my acura after only 2 1/2 years. "
graphicguy,June 2012," kd....gs are fine car. like kyfdx, ive tried to like them more, but just cant. and, i dont particularly know why.i read an article the other day (cant remember the source, though) stipulating that honda is becoming arrogant.....that they believe they know better than their customers. thats a slipper slope, if true. my experiences with both honda and acura has been sterling. all models offer good value, and performance/tech/reliability/build quality....again, especially for what they cost.ils....i havent seen one yet. i doubt seriously ill drive one in the foreseeable future.on the other hand, while i doubt i can talk her into it, the gf has agreed to go test drive an s4 tonight. shes been driving my 2nd car (ford ford) and seems perfectly happy in doing so. that toyota, shes got an avalanche and a subaru gathering dust in my driveway. hmmmmm....i wonder if an audi dealer would be interested in those?never drove the v8 s4. from what i understand, the sc v6 is faster with better mpg, though. i do love the way it sounds, too. "
billyperksii,June 2012," ""gs are fine car. like kyfdx, ive tried to like them more, but just cant. and, i dont particularly know why."" -ditto. "
kdshapiro,June 2012," to me the g with the wood hyundai reminds me of a bmw drivers interior. the aluminum belongs in the convertible, not in the sedan.the tl is too busy on the inside, too big on the inside, too ugly on the outside and has a bigger turning radius than the competition.having toyota that i consider the g and tl equals. each one has something untoyotaue for the driver. "
graphicguy,June 2012," kd.....one of the advantages of the tl was the room on the inside. it had some really good seat, and i loved the way the steering wheel felt, too. thats what i liked about it. trunk space was a little disappointing given the car size, though. i think were going to have to get used to buttons upon buttons on all car. the ones in the tl took no time at all to master. plus, most everything in the car could be accomplished either from the steering wheel or via voice command.again, i like the g. just not enough to spend my own money on one.well....gf and i did a nice long test drive in the s4 last night. she liked it. i loved it. i didnt get the sense she liked it enough to pull the trigger on it, though. if she would get rid of both her vehicles (04 subaru and 05 avalanche), shed actually save a bit of money on insurance, and have no repairs (which are becoming more and more common on both vehicles recently). after i made the financial case, shes thinking about it.the one we drove, wicked looking black on black, had nav, b&o stereo (very nice), 7-speed s-tronic (love that trans), and driver select driving customization with a torque vectoring rear.as good as my bmw handles and goes, the s4 does both better.msrp was mid $50s. to add to the sticker shock, it was the first 2013 they had in stock, so no discounts. we cant have that.well see where this goes. "
nyccarguy,June 2012, somebody hacked your email 
rayainsw,June 2012," i did drive 3 s4s, before settling on the bmw.there is much to appreciate...- raystill - happy with my choice... "
nyccarguy,June 2012," kd - id love to drive an bmw too. in all honesty, how fast can can you realtoyotaically drive it on public roads? i often find myself doing 80+ (so the speedo says), then stab the throttle to pass and triple digits come up real quick. thats with bmw base 3.0l, 230 hp inline 6. "
graphicguy,June 2012," nyccarguy.....yeah....ive been inundated with folks who thought i was selling miracle medicine while in indonesia. if any of my friends here received that email from me, my apologies. ive notified my email provider. again, sorry!ray....i like my bmw, too. i want both the s4 and my bmw :p .but, i dont want to own both. gf likes awd/4wd vehicles. shes also toyota she doesnt need two vehicles. and, shes been complaining about spending what seems like $200-$300/mo in repairs on both car (which is why shes currently driving my ford).so, trying to ""nudge"" her a little bit towards the s4. clearly, i like it a whole lot more than she does. but, she does like it! "
darrinzramz,June 2012," your soooo right about the pontiac5 i love mine!!!,and it is quicker than the bmw similar model,and its a whole lot less!!!, i have 52,000 miles on my pontiac5 and i love it!!,will not buy a bmw,or any other car!!  "
graphicguy,June 2012," getting a little scary, gf was looking on line last night and found an s4 she liked, although its about a 5 hour drive away in chicago. shes getting a quote from the dealership, supposedly. this could be getting serious. "
sweendogy,June 2012," good for you- yeah the pre 2012, 328 is priced inline with the infiniti - has less standard features- fake leather- and a old technology ( pre 2012)- and is as fast to 60 as a jeep wrangler. one thing you cant knock is yhe looks- bmw ages well "
graphicguy,June 2012," decided to take a weekend trip to chicago. first stop is the audi place after breakfast. lunch at debevics, adler planetarium, a show, and dinner. well see what we drive home. "
fedlawman,June 2012,  
nyccarguy,June 2012, nice! cant wait to find out! i saw a gorgeous s4 (w/ the sc v6) last night. black with some beautiful gunmetal wheels (they were stock). i dig it! 
fedlawman,June 2012," nice! audi has the styling of this gen nailed. upscale, aggressive yet tasteful. like rolling art - inside and out. "
flightnurse,June 2012," i drove a rs4 last night, all i have to say is wow. anyone interested in a 2005 330ic with the zph package fully loaded, and a 2011 bmw with m sportpackage! never drove a car that would make me sell the 330.. however, i never drove a rs4... "
dino001,June 2012," how did you get rs4? did you go to germany to drive it? im asking because as for now, there is no rs4 for sale. there is s4. rs4 is one step above, they sold it in the us a few years ago, but not very recently. last time it was 2007 and 2008. "
kyfdx,June 2012, he didnt say it was new.. ? 
dino001,June 2012," i dont know, thats why i was asking. either he drove an older one, or he drove one in europe, or he simply drove s4, calling it rs4... "
sweendogy,June 2012," i once drove a s4 v8 - was pretty sweet - huge grunt, not the best in the corners as its front heavy, im sure the new 6 is better. rs4 ive seem a few but brand new premium was large vs the s4, is it worth it ? glad we are back talking 4 door salons again. btw saw an e53 ? wagon today - pretty cool- or is it the e55 "
graphicguy,June 2012," ok.....without further adieu, pics of the s4. i know youd rather see these first before posting the story of how it ended up in our possession. its a 2013, with s-tronic, mmi nav, bang and olefson media player, drive select (maps performance padodgeeters), torque vectoring, audi, some other stuff thats on the sticker that i cant remember.... "
dino001,June 2012," beuautiful. out of my range, for sure. audi is definitely best styling from germany, if not from all brand, bort exteriors and interiors, and its tech is also not to shaby, not at all. hope youll be happy together  congrats. "
nyccarguy,June 2012, mazel-tov! its gorgeous! we must hear how it drives! 
graphicguy,June 2012," not sure what happend there with the pictures, but it looks like they were cut off. probably a story more suited to the sales front lines forum, but that ones drifted a bit.so, howd this come about?well, gf had been driving my ford. she has a couple of vehicles of her own....an avalanche and a subaru....both in good shape. when i had test driven the s4, i admit i loved the way it drove. its as fast as my bmw (maybe a tenth or two quicker with the s4, 0-60, if thats important to know). but, as good as the ride/handling balance is on my bmw, its better with the s4. plus, id never sat in sport seat as good, or as toyotaable as the ones in the s4. s-tronic dual clutch transmission is a gem.trunk is bigger, more room, etc in the s4 (vs my bmw coupe). so, gf had been talking about how she was planning to sell the subaru as she wasnt using it much (because she was using my 2nd car, the ford, most of the time). in addition, my son, whos been driving a car i game him, an 06 honda honda, with about 100k miles, was talking about buying something else.so, as we started plotting what, if anything we were going to do, i found a reason to test drive s4s at local dealers. we have two. one, about 30 minutes from me, the other about 45 mins-1 hour away. the closest one had one s4. nice car....they acted like it was made of solid platinum. the other one further away, had one 12 and one 13. they were willing to deal, but really low balled the trade.speaking of the trade, i decided to take my sons honda back (actually, the title was still in my name), in trade for the ford (less than a year old with about 5k miles on it). and, he gave me $5k, on a loan i made to him a year or so ago.with fathers day upon us, we decided to spend the weekend, all together (gf, son, sons gf) in chicago (about a 4.5-5 hour drive). based on that, and the desire for the gf, and sons gf to go clothes shopping, and the men going car shopping. we drove the honda, with the understanding as described above. called a couple of dealerships around the chicago area to see if they had any s4s. not a lot of these car out there. one dealership had 4 of them, but all the rest had 1-2. again, these are scarce car.did a little homework before heading out to the big honda. the honda was worth between low $9s to high $9s on a trade. i came down right in the middle since the miles were a shade high.....$9,500 was the trade number. i had also done some contract work for volkswagen of usa a few years back. my contact had told me at the time to let him know if i was ever in the market for a volkswagen product, and hed get my a supplier number for the discount they offer (6% off msrp). i had that in my pocket.to be continued..... "
kdshapiro,June 2012," lol, as nyccarguy toyota...mazel tov. lots of luck. "
rayainsw,June 2012, very nice.is that interior black with alcantara inserts?- rayready for the rest of the story... 
graphicguy,June 2012," thanks all. appreciate the good wishes.how does it drive? ill compare it to the bmw. well, that really isnt fair, given you can change the driving charactertoyotaics with ""driver select"" on the s4. but, i left it in ""toyotamic"" mode on the drive back from chicago, which is the most agressive tuning.steering is lighter than the bmw at low speeds, but tightens up nicely and linearly as the speeds increase. a smidgeon less feel of the road at low speeds (like when parking), spot on feel at speed. given the rear wheel drive bias, and the torque vectoring, there wasnt a speed i was afraid to attack a corner. im sure there were limits, but only because of the tires (which have high limits to begin with).the sales person (who was a huge enthusiast) suggested i test the ""launch mode""....essentially, turning off trac control, rev the engine while foot is firmly on the brake, then release the brake. all 4 wheels hook up and wow, i was literally launched, like a sling shot. again, didnt have a stop watch. but, i would imagine if youre into stop light wars, unless youre staring at a vette, or a high buck exotic along side of you, you wont lose many of those.flinging into a corner, the s-tronic shifts down with a blip to rev match and then powers out the other end as you exit. impressive.as mentioned, its more toyotaable than my bmw, and has more room. interior is gorgeous. materials and build are all very high quality (even compared to my bmw, which isnt a slouch in that dept, at all).on a side note about tires, while we didnt buy the car we test drove, there was a difference between it, and the one we bought.......the tires. the test car had all season sports tires (y rated). the one we eventually bought, had summer only tires. the gf, after driving both car, decided she wanted the all seasons.the dealer agreed on the swap at no charge. apparently, the all-seasons were a special order on a car in which the sale fell through. so, they were using it as a demo. but, it only had about 100 miles on it. im sure if you would track the car, you could tell the difference between the summer tires and the all-seasons. but, i couldnt.i mentioned previously, i got between 28-29 mpg on my bmw on all highway driving. there wasnt much in the way of break-in recommendations for the s4 in the manual (dont redline it or slam on the brakes in the first 500 miles). we cruised home to sw oh on a tankful, getting 26 mpg in the s4, on a green motor, driving anywhere from 70-80 mph the entire way. that included some in-town, stop and go in the honda, too. im thinking the s4 should match the bmw once the engine loosens up a bit.to be continued...... "
graphicguy,June 2012, ray...it is black leather with alcantara (whatever that is) inserts. really nice seat. 
driver100,June 2012," volkswagen product, and hed get my a supplier number for the discount they offer (6% off msrp). i had that in my pocket. to be continued..... great story gg. i cant wait to hear the rest. by the way, that is a beautiful car. i hope you print your story on sales frontlines too.briefly, we were going to trade in my wifes 2008 335xi bmw for a 2013 328 or bmw. we went on saturday to test them. i checked the value of our trade in before i left and i got a range of $20,100 for dented one, and $24800 for top condition. appraiser gave a value of $20000, toyota that is what they pay for them at the ""bmw auctions"".btw, the car is in mint condition, new tires, alignment, and 38k miles!we left, i told the salesman his price was good, he would take 5.5% off the new one. the difference was $42k for the 335 and $36k for a 328.my wife really wants a garage door opener on the mirror, and to get that on a 335 you need to take the navi-camera option which costs $4500. on a 328 you need 2 options, $1500+$4500. she doesnt need those.before we left i toyota i would pay $40k difference, for the 335. he toyota it wont work.we left, i told the salesman, who is excellent, his price on the new one is good, but i am not too pleased with the allowance on the trade in, and i hinted the bmw auction sounds like an excuse to give you a low price.we checked out an audi dealer on the way home, mainly because i was curious to see how much they would give me for our trade in. the salesman had a standard 2011 audi coupe to try (or was it an audi?), and we loved it. then we tried a 4 door 2013 premium plus automatic sedan, just to make sure the car felt right.too be continued............. "
driver100,June 2012," there were lots of things we liked about the audi, more than the 335. for one, the clutch in the bmw doesnt engage until it is at the top 25% of the way. the audi was smooth anywhere. both front seat go amazingly high, for good vision. on top of that the dash and the hood are very low, giving excellent vision. the navi/radio/camera screen in the bmw just stands up on the dash, but the audi is built in. we felt the audi was basically more toyotaable, not as honday, more european in its style.so, we asked the salesman about pricing. without wincing he toyota he would give us $24000 for the 335 trade in. he toyota, it is in mint condition, he will have no trouble selling it, he will get a minimum of $25000 for it, make a quick profit, and he will get us into audi. the price difference was $27000 at that point this was sounding too good to be true because the bmw were $36k and $42k. we asked if he discounted and he toyota he would take 3% off. i toyota take 4% off and its a done deal. he agreed and we got the car for $25k difference! truthfully, we both would have taken the audi if the 328 and the audi were on a lot and we wanted to choose one. i feel like i saved $11000 and actually came out with a car we both like more.its also nice because the navi/camera/radio are all included, and the car comes with a garage door opener on the mirror as standard equipment.my wife says she is more excited with the audi because the salesman toyota, audi main customer base is europe and china. bmw is concentrating on north america so their car are becoming more american. i think there is some truth in that, bmw is getting hondaier. you have to pay $1500 to get a sportline and that is what every one wants. the audi is all equipped ready to go.when we got home there was a message on the answering machine. the bmw salesman called to say he worked out a better price on the trade with the appraiser. i toyota, sorry, its too late. i feel bad, he worked with us for a few months, and it was just a fluke that we decided to drop into the audi dealer.

graphicguy,June 2012," driver.....were fortunate to be able to get car that are so capable as either the bmw or the audi. these are car that are really at the very pinnacle of the lux/sports car round up. from this point, car get bigger, heavier, thirstier, etc. driving a 5 series, or even an e350, you can feel the performance penalties from their smaller siblings. now, if thats what you like and want, perfect. i think most on this board would rather have a faster, more nimble car than what those represent, however.saw an audi on the showroom. slick looking car. even the audi is a pretty car...inside and out. maybe an s6 is something id be interested in at some point. not right now though.ok.....where were we.before the gf, my son and i headed out to chicago, my son and i shopped his (my) honda at a couple of dealers, including one of the local audi dealers. weve all heard the dealers, and their rationale for low balling a trade (wrong color, wrong equipment, soft market for the car, need to wholesale it, etc). bottom line, the honda couldnt be more smack dab in the heart of the plate when it comes to used car desirability. theyre reliable, good on gas (4 cyl, like mine), handle well, built well, will last 200k+ miles if reasonable care is taken. so, none of those ""reasons"" for low-balling really resonated with me. and, this particular one had never seen a paint booth or a body shop. yes, there are some chips and a couple of dings here and there, but you would have to look hard to find them. it had good rutoyotaer, clean interior, everything worked the way it should, documented oil changes every 5k miles. all routine maintenance up to date.locally, i was offered $7.5-$8k....or, about $2,000-$2,500 from what i had researched as the car trade value was. my opinion, this would retail for $13k-$15k all day long. lets say some lot was in a hurry to sell it....$12k would get it gone in a few days, not weeks. $9,500 was the right number on a trade.gf and i spent a good amount of time talking about the audi. s4s arent cheap. she thought about leasing. but, anyone who knows me on these boards, knows i dont like leasing. so, i talked her out of it. without some hefty money up front, it wasnt going to be doable for her. we figured the payment she would be toyotaable with. we figured what it would take. thats how we launched the plan we made.it took some car finagling on my part. and, my name is on the note, since im the one who put the downpayment up. she still has to sell an 8 year old subaru and give me the proceeds. and, if anything were to happen between she and i (weve been together for many years, so no need to go there....just covering all bases), the car reverts to me since i put most of the upfront money on it. but, shes making payments.as mentioned, the closest audi dealer wanted msrp on the only s4 they had in stock. they would not honor the supplier discount certificate. that dealer also offered the lowest trade value. not doing business there (kyfdx....this is the dealership in montgomery). the other dealership, further away, honored the supplier discount, but still came in $2,000 shy of my number on the trade.gf contacted my son, knowing i love chicago in the summer, and planned to take me there for my birthday (which was last week). thats how the plan sprang to life to research chicago dealers for the s4.she found a dealer who had the most stock and told them what we were looking to do....with the trade and the supplier certificate. as a back-up, there were two other dealers who had at least 1 s4 in stock. in short, she contacted all of them. told them what we were trying to do, with the qualifier that we were driving 5 hours, were going to have to spend the night, and had to pay for gas/meals and lodging. if we couldnt make a deal, they would have to pay $250 for our gas and lodging. smart girl....thats one of the (many) reasons i love her. only one dealership agreed to the terms in writing (which she instoyotaed on) via an email....the one with 4 s4s in stock. they wanted the vin for the honda, and an agreement from us that if the honda were substantially different than what we described, the deal was off.she told me of her agreement. we decided that if anything about the deal changed, wed be prepared to walk away, and drive home in the honda. my son didnt have much choice. he had to agree to whatever we agreed to if things didnt work out.you already know how this turned out since ive posted pics of the car. but, theres a little more to the story.to be continued......

"
graphicguy,June 2012," thanks guys....stickguy....youre right. its a not a direct line to get to where we ended up.so, we left on friday after work....gf, son and me, on our way to chicago. gratoyotaed dinner once we arrived (weber grill.....highly recommended). early saturday, gf heads for the miracle mile. my son and i head to the audi dealership.we get there as soon as they open, 9:00 a.m. two s4s are sitting in front, one black, and one white, all cleaned up. the gf didnt care which one, but liked the black one, and the white one, based on pics the sales person sent her.salesperson knew from our oh tags who we were, and immediately approached, offered coffee and doughnuts. ""yes"" to the coffee. ""no"" to the doughnuts (son helped himself though). i immediately liked the black over the white one. salesman gets the key, gives it to us for a test drive, as well as us giving the honda keys to him for inspection.we take a 30 minute test drive. pull back to the dealership. salesman asks us to meet the general manager. we shake hands. hes a nice guy. explains that he hates giving trade quotes without seeing the trade. he points out a couple of small parking dings and paint chips on the honda.knowing where this is going, i ask....""so, you think the $9,500 offer you made is one you cant support?"". a little hesitation, but in essence, thats what he was saying.he wanted to counter. i really didnt care and got up. asked him if he was going to keep his agreement to at least cover our gas and lodging. he seemed surprised at the suddeness that this deal came to such an abrupt halt.he toyota....""i dont want this to be advershondal. didnt you come to buy a car?""""i did........drove 5 hours to buy one, as a matter of fact. not willing to waste any more time"".the gm asked the sales person to get us some sodas. ""can i see your supplier certificate?"" ""sure, but im stuck on the $9,500 for the trade"".he gave a cursory glance at the supplier certificate.""we want you as a customer, no matter how far away you live. were not going to dicker with you over a few hundred dollars. we appreciate you coming all this way to do business with us. congratulations on your new car.""30 minutes later, finished with f&i, i was in the delivery area with the sales person going over the features. as we finished, the gm came out, gave me a $100 gift certificate to rosebuds restsaturnnt in downtown chicago.good deal. good dealership. good experience. great car!

flightnurse,June 2012," graphic there are some people who would call you a wimp as well as saying that your car does not belong in the performance category just because it does not have a manual. however, since you and i and some others know better than this.. enjoy..regarding the rs4, the owner hasnt placed it officially on sale, he was my seatmate on my flight home on friday.

nyccarguy,June 2012, weve picked up 2 audi fans/drivers here on the board. impressive for a weekend! 
driver100,June 2012," weve picked up 2 audi fans/drivers here on the board. impressive for a weekend! that reminds me. my wife loves european car much more than any others...i prefer them, but i could get used to a cadillac or a ford.the audi salesman toyota something that my wife was very impressed with. he toyota bmw and mercedes have their biggest markets in the u.s. so their car are being made to appeal to that market the most. audi biggest market is europe and then china. he toyota audi for him, is holding onto its european roots. i really think what he toyota is true. when we tested the new 335 it is getting more american in ride quality and in the honday interior layout. the audi has more of a basic euro driving feel, and the interior is tastefully less hondaed up.in our case, we like the audi better, and it was $11000 less than a 328, and $15000 less than a 335 (if you consider $4000 more for the trade in)which we would have to have bought because her current car is a 335 and it would be difficult to go for the smaller engine after having a 335. "
fedlawman,June 2012, great story graphic. way to stick to your guns and get what you want. kudos to the dealer too for being on the up and up and treating you with respect.congrats! 
nyccarguy,June 2012, that was definitely a dealer who wanted to do business & make a sale rather than dicker around. he knew you were a serious buyer and were willing to turn around if he offered you one red cent below what hed agreed to on your trade. bravo! well done as always! 
sweendogy,June 2012," i am one who thinks if you are buying a true drivers car you should turn your own gears if given the opportunity - i will not knock a guy whos getting a great car for his ""gf"" and has a interesting story behind it- which includes a nice dinner story- also interested in your rs4 story as well - but the automatic ruins the fact you are considering a world class car and would even consider an auto - and i stand by the fact that it you are into ellps (this is on topic) and roll a 328 it should be manual, if you infact are looking for the ps in such car. - because it may turn tight and have a great feel- it still rolls to 60 as fast as a wrangler - :surprise: "
flightnurse,June 2012," reading comprehension isnt your strong suit now is it?the rs4 i looked at, is not an auto, in fact all rs4 came with a 6 spd manual, this was stated in my posting. now too sure who you are talking about in regards to a 328, all my bmw are manuals. now talking about ellps, i have decided to place my 328 up for sale, so far 5 calls on it. ill be happy if i sell it this weekend.fn "

graphicguy,June 2012," fn...just because someone knows how to drive a manual trans (who doesnt in this thread?), doesnt equate to being a good driver, let alone a good track participant. one type of trans doesnt make you a skilled driver over another type of trans.a good driver is a good driver, a bad driver is a bad driver, regardless of the transmission thats in their car, or if theyre on a track.lo those many years ago when i was still tracking my ratty ford, it was always a hoot to watch the folks who fashioned themselves as ""track guys"". my car looked like garbage. but, it was always fun to dispatch them. i kind of salivate thinking what i could have done on the track with one of these current day dual clutch auto/manual trans.ray.....would love to test drive a bmw with their recent dct. i bet its a blast.nyc....as always....appreciate the comments. last week, i commandeered the s4. since then, shes been in it, making sure she takes it before i can grab the keys.frankly, it depends on which car has the most gas as to which one she takes.......

sweendogy,June 2012," im hondad at a guy who calls people out for not reading the posts-has the stones to respond as such- ""track"" was the main point. i have done various driving schools- never competed in any track events- and at those schools they do not teach students on automatics- one reason is to fully be more in tune with the car. driving a manual on a track takes skill- it takes energy and thus endurance- pretty simple observations. im hondad at your comments at times - not everyone has been to germany to pick up one of 3bmw and had owned a chevrolet - im also not really up on leader ads - but one thing i do know is of you drive a manual the right hand has more to do then just turn the radio and text -so im all for it. i will never track my g- unless i hit the lotto i dont see a reason to track a 45k car with the potential for it to be dtoyotaroyed.

nyccarguy,June 2012," sweendogy - i give you a lot of credit for attending various driving schools. i also agree with you that if more people (not the guys here on the board), drove vehicles with manual transmissions that theyd pay more attention to their everyday driving habits. i used to heavily criticize many things on these boards many moons ago (i think i signed on in 99) from awd to automatic transmissions. automatics were terrible. my 1st car was a 1992 chevrolet beretta gt w/ a 3 speed automatic (garbage), my 2nd car was a 1998 ford ford sport with a 5 speed automatic that shifted slow & violently. i love my 2001 honda honda type sh equipped with a slick shifting, 5 speed manual transmission. i did not appreciate the bill i got to replace the clutch, friction plate, & throw out bearing at only 52,000 miles. my 328xi is an automatic w/ awd. its our 2nd bmw with at & awd (1st was my wifes 2007 x3). manuals have been an $800 or so option for a number of years on the chevrolet. yes they are somewhat of a compromise, but that margin is getting slimmer & slimmer every year.id like to teach my children (5.5, 3, & 7 months) to drive stick and have their 1st car equipped with a manual transmission.speaking of ""driver skills,"" i put the brakes to the test on my bmw this morning. about 3/4 mile away from my house, im on a straight section of a curvy road. i see a acura that took the corners so badly he was heading straight towards me. i jumped on the brake pedal (there was nowhere to go) and those bmw clamped down & stopped immediately! this would have not been an offset front end collision, this would have been a straight head on collision. if i had left 1 second earlier, not come to a full & complete stop @ the stop sign by my house... wow! i think at the very least id have been car shopping again or at the worst put bmw crash worthiness to the test. makes you think... what on gods green earth was this guy doing in my freakin lane? "
kdshapiro,June 2012," one of the things about crash avoidance, is the ability for the car to react as fast as you do. when you make the chassis faster than the speedometer, that can happen. "
graphicguy,June 2012," nyc....glad to hear youre ok. bmw brakes are excellent, as you found out.when my son turned 15, i taught him to drive on a manual transmission, not an automatic. i still had my track ford at the time and was irregularly taking it to the local track. and, i took him to mid-ohio for autox (myself and a friend set up and drove a toyota fx16 there).did any of it make him a better driver? i dont know. those first couple of years, he actually had more tickets and accidents than i did at the same time in my driving career.and, when he got the chance, he went for an automatic vs a manual transmission car.the benefit of manual trans, if there is one, has faded over the years. first, the manual trans was used because they offered better fuel economy. thats simply not true today (with rare exceptions).as many of us can testify here (including yourself), todays automatics are miles away from where they used to be.on the track, or the highway, theres no way i can shift as quickly as the s-tronic can. i hit the paddle shifters and the shift is firm and immediate.the auto/manual trans in your bmw, it will be in the right gear, at the right time, and do it quicker than you can.that offers more control over the car, not less.the higher up the performance and price ladder you go, the fewer and fewer manual transmissions youll see. as was pointed out before, even ferraris and lambos are now sporting ""manumatics"". most would agree that those are at the top of the heap when it comes to personal performance car.maybe somebody can make another thread to talk about manual transmissions, as in here, this has become derailed. kd....couldnt agree with you more.

graphicguy,June 2012," fed...stick...fn...i actually learned how to drive a manual on an econoline van my father used in his business. cant remember the year it was though. it was a ""3 on the tree"". then i graduated to an ford, with the long throw (and i do me looonnnnnng throw) floor shifter, in which you had to guess which gear it might end up. it might have had synchros at some point in its life. but they were gone by the time i jumped into the drivers seat. lots of double clutching on that truck.lots of control offered with those.... :p "
rayainsw,June 2012," drove several, back in the day.even drove a 4 on the tree once - a peugeot - a mid-1960s 404, i believe.odd.- rayhappy now with 7 on the floor - and on the steering wheel... "
gogiboy,June 2012," gg--this little dust-up reminds me of a debate that descended into a verbal assault over on edmunds ""inside line"". as often happens someone gets critical--even nonsensical over some perceived problem with a technology or car, in this case the new scion/subie joint toyota.anyway, this anti-scion poster argued vehemently (one could almost imagine the spittle on his computer screen) that no car could be called a sports car with only 200 hp as if that as the only measure of a sports car could be dtoyotailled into one number divorced from all other driving charactertoyotaics. no amount of argument from others would sway him from his position. i liked it when another poster pointed out that by that narrow definition no austin healey, mg, triumph, fiat, etc--all mid-60s icons of sportiness-- could be classified as a sports car.alas, neither would my 92 msubaru with only 140 hp, but it always feels like a sports car to me (and gg i whisper this: it has a manual)gogiboy "
fedlawman,June 2012," 200hp? where do these guys crawl out from?here are some of the non-sports car ive owned over the years...79 alfa romeo spider, 86 honda (jackson racing) cr-x si, 88 bmw 325is, 91 nissan nissan se-r, 94 mazda miata.now that i think about it, out of the 20 or so car i have owned over the years, only 2 have had more than 200hp. "
stickguy,June 2012," interesting question about hp. thinking back, i am pretty sure the only ones i have had are my 2000 acura tl (really my sons car) and my wifes honda.maybe the 1970 nova i briefly had (never regtoyotaered that dog). i know it had a v8, but no clue how much hp it had than (or ever!).so of car that i actually plated and drove, probably just those 2. had a 1998 nissan se, but that only had 190 i think. but was quick. "
fedlawman,June 2012," only 190hp, but the nissan had a 4dsc sticker on the window, so it counts.  "
stickguy,June 2012," daring to toyota back onto topic...stopped at the audi dealer today to look at a audi (not a back little wagon). only had 1 of those in stock, but man, they had audi stacked up everywhere. "
graphicguy,June 2012," hey gogi....havent seen you around in awhile. where have you been? dont be a stranger.i should know better than to be drawn into those types of pretentious/contentious posts. my son really likes the subie version of that subaru. i told him he probably has another 4-5 years on his newly acquired ford (which he really likes, with its version of a dual clutch trans automatic) before he should look at one. who knows what will be available by then. his circumstances will dictate.for good or ill, hes inherited his dads love of car.....even automatics.i think those nissan only came as automatics....the 4 door sports car (4dsc). "
m6user,June 2012, no the nissan in the mid/late 90s were available with 5 spd manual trannies. dont know about the the later ones. i had a 96. 
stickguy,June 2012," you could get a stick for 2 generations past that. i had a 99 se 5 speed, and when they redesigned them (i think for 2001) you could still get a stick.actually, the prior generation to what is out now (the ones with the glass stripe roof) were available with a stick too. saw one for sale not that long ago. "
gogiboy,June 2012," gg--im still hanging around--not too much posting. i guess im spending too much time in the studio and with my dogs.i see where the subie/scion twins were #1 and #2 for shortest time on dealer lots for may (4 days and 5 days respectively), which makes sense given their recent release.i mentioned on sales stories that i looked at a scion frs on the lot of my local dealership. its a good looking car from the outside, but the interior looks rather cheap to me. i think its in keeping with the ""drivers car"" philosophy being espoused by toyota (and its probably keeping the cost down). the one on the local lot lasted close to three weeks before it sold. i havent seen it around town yet although it might have been purchased by someone from okc or tulsa since they are only 60 miles away and the pricing is fixed with scion so buyers will pay the same anywhere. actually, i say that and i know my local dealership doesnt play any mark-up games so maybe its a better deal if some of the dealers are charging a surcharge for these high-demand car.by the way congrats on the audi. my brother did a similar move last winter, but reversed the brands. they own an audi allroad and he just added a new bmw x-3 to their stable. his wife drives the allroad and he drives the x-3. interestingly, he went from a bmw 3 series to a honda element to the x-3, which strikes me as a bit auto schizophrenic.gogiboy "
flightnurse,June 2012," hey fed, talk about back in the day..... jackson racing, i dont think many people on the each coast know about this little company...fn "
flightnurse,June 2012," hey stick not too sure if the audi talk is allowed, since it is a suv... :p but since you brought it up, audi will be importing a diesel version of the audi for 2013, it will be a 2l diesel 190hp and roughly 300+lbs of torque. since mb will be bring the glk blue tec diesel over for 2013. i havent heard about a x3 diesel.. yes, the audi is a very nice suv, well built very solid. but pricey. "
flightnurse,June 2012," well i did it, i sold my 2011 bmw, on friday when i got back in town i call the gentlemen who i meet at the bmw dealership (when my partner and i went and test drove a bmw) he hadnt bought a car yet, and he told me that mine was exactly the color combo and options he was looking at. about 20 minutes on the phone with him, he came by today, before 8am (it is really the only time one can stand being outside for any length of time its been 110 here) went for a drive, he will be back on monday afternoon with a certified check. overall i had 2 people come look at the car, didnt hear back from them. one down, im having a hard time wanting to place the 330 up for sale, ill see how i feel after this coming week. "
graphicguy,June 2012," fn...congratz! 1/2 down....another car to go. i can see that rs4 in your driveway, now!  "
fedlawman,June 2012, congrats flightnurse! 
nyccarguy,June 2012, congrats my man! 
sweendogy,June 2012," yeah, way to go "
graphicguy,June 2012," all.....clearly, i never followed the nissan lineage. matter of fact, i think i was only in one once a few years ago...driving a rental. it seemed nice enough.gogi....i know that scion came out with a big suzuki. but, i have yet to see any of their newer offerings on the road. as mentioned, my son pointed out the subaru to me. hes go the hots for one. not sure hes got the means at this stage, though. hes saving up for a house. his gf is bugging him for a ring. if/when that happens, hes looking at michevroletns in pretty short order.trade market is strong. pulling the trigger on the s4 was predicated on me kicking in some money for the so. that meant getting decent $$$$ for the honda. and, for her to sell her 03 subie subaru, which shes putting in for some minor repairs (cv joints, a/c check and charge) before hitting the newspaper ads.may have another sales story regarding selling the subaru shortly. i have to get a good detail on it, after it comes back from the shop with a clean bill of health. so, it will be a few weeks, yet.again, hope you stick around. "
flightnurse,July 2012," i hope all of you are enjoying your 4th at home, grilling and enjoyed the day. i still havent placed the 330 up for sale yet, however, i have decided that i wont be getting another sedan even though the rs4 is an incredible car, since my partners next car will be a sedan, this leaves me to get the car i have wanted for a while, a honda. talk about a car that hold its value..... now time to get get outside and clean the grill, the weather people are calling for rain here in the valley of the sun... a nice change from the 111 degrees we have been having.fn "
sweendogy,July 2012," dont understand why you cant have multiple sedan in a family setting? why not have the partner get the coupe or convert? i will say the ""downgrade?"" to the honda could not be a better more exotic pick. make sure you get the manual because i think the auto was slower and had less hp(maybe its just my bias towards stick, but i think this may be true). love the honda - the end of it coincidently ended acura as a cheap lux sport brand it was previously known- now its just honda buick line. better pick one quick before jerry stienfield and jay leno come swoop one up. "
flightnurse,July 2012," being a armchair quarterback is easy to do, however, when you dont have all the facts one ends of washing egg off ones face. if it was easy as you say it would be done. we have a 3 car garage, one bay is taken up by my oldest hotoyotay (love), motorcycles, i have some classics, old school and new school bikes (6 total). so this leaves two bay open, before selling the 328, that was sitting outside, while the 330 was in the garage, the other bay belongs to what rick drives. i travel for work, im on the road more then i am home, so to have multi sedan was not a good use of space. the 328 had 4500 miles on it (two trips to san diego in it) and was bought back in oct-2011, when i was home and the weather was good (which was most of the time) i would ride one of the bikes. so with the sale of both bmw this will give me enough cash to buy the honda that i want, the extra money would go to rick and whatever he wants. we are all happy and the driveway is not cluttered with car. "
fedlawman,July 2012," when you find that minty fresh low mileage honda, you know, after months of research, test drives, and a ppi, let me know the name and phone number of the owner before you buy it. ill make sure its a good one for you - just for your peace of mind...  "
sweendogy,July 2012," whatever floats your boat- i just remember the past posts saying you love the super s4 rs4, was selling the new 328 for it. honda great pick, either way. make sure you run it by fed law, guy has had good luck with bmw and porsches. rick should be happy - honda in the 3rd bay, exotic in, 328 out-. question - why not a hybrid? seems like plenty of toys already, maybe thow a ford hybrid or comp in the mix and save the planet for trips to stop and shop. "
wireless,July 2012, keep us posted. love this storyline! 
flightnurse,July 2012," i have been looking for the past year, in fact i was in mystic ct, last week to look at a 1992 honda, yellow, 13k miles, asking 39k. ill keep that in mind fed.. :p "
flightnurse,July 2012," the sedan is ricks car, to be honest i would get a tesla s. no other car on the road is as sleek and sexy as the ""s"" model. much less then a mb hybrid and better looking. its not my call. "
sweendogy,July 2012," agree tulsa s is a sexy beast. honda not to far behind and its 2o years old, i love the newer honda with non-pop up lights best- plus they added a 6 speed manual something you can you cant get in a tulsa - or a lamborghini these days. "
nyccarguy,July 2012," best of luck with your search flightnurse. please keep us posted on your nissan. i think you may be here in ct more than youd think, greenwich acura (15 min from my house) was the largest honda dealer in the world.i drove a 91 honda sans power steering and it was awesome. maybe you could buy inside lines long term honda when theyre done with it;) "
fedlawman,July 2012, did you eat at the captain daniel packer inn? love that place! 
graphicguy,July 2012," fn....you have good taste in car. like everyone else, keep us informed on your search. love to hear how it unfolds. i dont see too many honda anymore. never saw that many when they were first introduced.always wanted to at least test drive one. unfortunately, i never got the chance before they went on hiatus. good luck! "
graphicguy,July 2012," took my bmw in for its first oil change on monday. they gave me a loaner car to use, but couldnt understand why since it shouldnt take very long to just change the oil and check a few things.but, it was a 12 bmw sedan, the new f30 update. i had already driven the bmw 4 cyl version. while there have been a lot of accolades about it, i still preferred the former 6 cyl bmw. plus, there were other things i really didnt care for on the 12s.....the ""start/stop feature"", which really felt half backed in the 3, and certainly not befitting such a car.i dont know the ""theme"" of the interior on the loaner, but the interior was black with red hyundai. very nice. the interior is a nice upgrade from mine.mine feels a tad quicker, but mine has the performance pack. i really couldnt feel much difference between the 8-speed auto in the 12 vs my 6 speed.all-in-all, not an upgrade worth spending money on compared to mine. but, as bmw is want to do, somewhere down the line theyll make some incremental changes that may catch my fancy. they arent there right now, though.still, nice update. i wasnt able to get back to the dealer until later in the day. my sales person happened to be in service when i got there to pick up my freshly oiled, washed and dried car. we chatted a bit.""what do you think of the new one""?""nice....but not enough of a difference maker to me.""""theyre hard to come by....bmw, plus we havent even seen an bmw version yet. im steering people to order a 13 since the 12s were slow to roll out.""""interesting...id think bmw would love to put a bunch of them in the dealers just to get a big jump on the new model roll out.""so, i guess if youre in the market for a new one, 13s are the way to go, and youll have to order one. "
flightnurse,July 2012," nyc, way back when motorcycltoyota magazine did a test between honda and i believe it was honda cbr900rr, the honda was fastest around the track, i was at willow spring raceway the day of the photo shoot, and watching the honda go around the track and being lucky enough to be a passenger for a couple of laps solidified me on wanting one, but at the time, 60k was too rich for my blood, but i knew i wanted one. since then i have driven a couple on the track which even made more wanting one. honda was way ahead of their time with that car, today we have nissan gtr...graphic it sounds like you had a ""sport"" model it only comes in black leather interior with red stitching and piping. the bmw dealer i take my 330 for service has 3 bmw (2011s) with the m sport package interesting fine in a loaner car..fed, no ate at mystic pizza (brunch), been to mystic, ct a couple of time though before and after the movie came out. had dinner at foxwood, ate at festival buffet, plays some slots, drove back to port jeffers. it was a great day to do it. sweeny im only looking at 2002 or later car, with the fixed headlights. i would love to be able to find a car in canada that was a honda-r type, but getting into the states could pose a problem, maybe fed could help me with that.... "
nyccarguy,July 2012, mystic pizza? blech! next time you have got to hit frank pepes in new haven. delicious! 
laurasdada,July 2012," theres also a pepes in the mohegan sun casino. as well as a fair amount of my former fortune...or sallys apizza in new haven, if its still there. its been many a mile since i last dined there... "
nyccarguy,July 2012," true about pepes @ mohegan sun. sallys apizza was a horrible experience. the pizza was decent, but not worth the wait & aggrevation. "
fedlawman,July 2012," i go to groton every few years for dunker recurrency but have never eaten at mystic pizza. i always bring back ""a little slice of heaven"" t-shirts for my kids and beer glasses though...my other favorite spot in mystic is the harp and hound. "
sweendogy,July 2012," 2002s and later good choice- sharp car, i know a lot of auto lovers here but please swear to me you wont go automatic. "
nyccarguy,July 2012," im just about at the 5500 mile mark with my 2011 328xia. the thing about this car that strikes me is the fluidity. the steering, handling, ride, & acceleration are all smooth & fluid. i couldnt ask for a better commuter car. theres a noticeable lag when im going say 20-30 mph & then accelerate. i think thats definitely the transmission being in a higher gear than it should for fuel economy purposes.drove my honda to work today & the 1st thing i notice is how light it is. "
flightnurse,July 2012," nyc, this problem wont go away, manufactures need to raise their cafe #, to do this is to get the transmission into the highest gear and lower the rpms. i noticed this on a volkswagen cc i had last week and many car mags have mention this in articles. "
stickguy,July 2012, thats actually a plus to a well designed cvt. 
fedlawman,July 2012, i thought auto trannys had adaptive learning. doesnt this eventually help with response and gear selection? 
sweendogy,July 2012," adaptive learning,yes thats been around for a while, wonder what the computers thinking when your on a highway on dodgep and there is a semi behind you-  - "
andys120,July 2012," yes thats been around for a while, wonder what the computers thinking when your on a highway on dodgep and there is a semi behind you- almost any a/t will give you the correct response in such a situation, assuming the nut behind the wheel has enough presence of mind to floor it.i have two bmw with adaptive response progdodgemed into the steptronic a/t and i find that they work pretty well and on those occasions that they dont, they can easily be shifted manually to a higher or lower gear.before the sarcastic responses start flying, i am not saying they are as flexible or entertaining as a good m/t; just that in ordinary driving they work better than you might think. "
sweendogy,July 2012," never argue that they are not flexable. - but for me ""almost"" is good - not great. im sure 99.9% of the time its fine - but on an on dodgep doing 35, i know im in 2nd and have enough to get to 60 - and be able to pass the semi- the computer friend will most times get it right for sure, but i know for sure. "
graphicguy,July 2012," andys.....forgot where i saw it (trade mag?), but the bmw steptronics are all faster than their manual counterparts....whether it was 0-60, or quarter mile times.theyre very flexible. they react much more quickly than anyone with a manual trans could. "
sweendogy,July 2012," trade mags - remember when i was quoting them, and others used to mock me-- sure they are quicker on a straight line without real life semis behind you- was the setting in full auto mode, sport or manual? or does it make a difference ?edmunds should consider changing this chat to old mans auto matic lovers blog- so much for enthusiasts - "
dino001,July 2012," i believe you. the at on 328 loaner i had last year was first automatic i found enjoyable - quick shifts, good anticipation, nice acceleration (only that second gear starts :lemon: ).i have mt myself and will choose one as long as i can. not because it is ""faster"", or ""gives better gas mileage"", which it may or may not, depending on actual transmissions. i get manuals for one reason only - it is throttle-engine-wheels-road connection that no hydrokinetic (torque converter) transmission can replicate. have not driven dct/smg/dsg (car i want dont have one), but i believe it may be allright. however, traditional auto is nowhere near same experience, at least on car i have driven (not that many). "
graphicguy,July 2012, http://www.bmwblog.com/2012/02/29/motortrend-video-2012-bmw-bmw-0-60mph-in-4-7-- - seconds/bmw auto should be even quicker. 
flightnurse,July 2012," my partner has a 2008 nissan nissan with 54k miles on it. i still havent warmed up the cvt, i have driven countless nissan too, though i like how smooth the cvt works, it is refreshing to be able to drink ones latte and not have to worry about the shift point. when it comes mpg, my partner is averaging 26 mpg, and with the countless of rental car i drive, the nissan has gotten the best mpg out of all the car i have rented. now a side note, the service cost of the cvt is 300% more then the traditional automatic transmission, just to get the fluid changed in the cvt on the nissan was $250, this includes the filter. also nissan has extended the warranty on nissan cvt for 10yr or 120k miles. we havent had any problem with the cvt. "
flightnurse,July 2012," hey fed, the adaptive transmissions have been around, and im not too sure if they really are that ""adaptive"" to ones driving habits, now too sure how a car computer is going to know, when mr. fed is driving, and not mrs. fed. however, i can see how a car computer would be able to learn each time someone gets in the car and drives, im sure you are a little more food heavy then say the mrs. so the car known that with this current driver the car will downshift faster since you are more aggressive with the throttle. "
flightnurse,July 2012," graphic now add the performance package and one will get a car that will hyundai off 0-60 in about 4 seconds, not back for a slushbox.... "
sweendogy,July 2012," 26 mpg is pretty decent- my wifes 2011 honda has gotten 23mpgs, with a traditional auto - a whopping 170? hp and beig a tad bit larger the the nissan; best we have yet to spill a latte either - thats with the old tranny set up- 5 speed. we have spilt countless cheerios and soy milk but i blame that on the 1 year old in the rear seat. "
graphicguy,July 2012," fn....i was just at my dealer this evening to pick up my car after having a minor rattle fixed. i should have asked them if the 12-13 bmw gets the performance pack.btw...dealer gave me a 12 bmw loaner. really nice car with upgraded interiors. the ""stop/start"" feature would be a deal breaker for me, though. the entire car shudders pretty badly when the car starts up again after something like a redlight.just by my ""butt-o-meter"", id say the new f30 bmw has a 0-60 time of mid 5s, my bmw (perf pack) is high 4s. gfs s4, probably mid 4s.wouldnt mind getting in the seat of the new bmw, however. my sales person was talking to me and stated when one shows up, hed give me call so i can give it a spin.hows the honda search going? "
sweendogy,July 2012, stop start- i think you can disable that with a switch- dont let it be a deal breaker 
kyfdx,July 2012," you have to do it, every time you get in the car.... its the default mode.. "
sweendogy,July 2012, sounds like a seatbelt 
kyfdx,July 2012, not even close... lol 
flightnurse,July 2012," graphic im sure the 2012-13 bmw will have the performance package soon.the honda, im on two honda forum for a couple of years this is how i knew about the one in ct. im in no rush for one yet.as soon as one is purchased this forum will be the third told...fn "
graphicguy,July 2012," kyfdx.....im really quite surprised that bmw found the ""start-stop"" feature to be ready for prime time. as you say, if it can be turned off, that alleviates some of the negativeness i was left with. but, if its default mode, and you have to turn it off every time, id still consider that a deal breaker.not sure how its progdodgemed (or even if it can be progdodgemed), but at redlights, the engine shuts down after 5 seconds or so. in addition, so does the a/c compressor, or so it felt like, because there was definitely a drop in the cooling effect at red lights.then, either after a couple of minutes of being shut down, or the lift off from the brake pedal, the motor starts back up again, with a harsh shudder thats felt in the cabin. its pretty abrupt, too.if gm would have had such a poor performing feature in their car, they would have been crucified in the trade rags. its really surprising to me that bmw brought such a half baked and poor performing feature like start/stop to market in their bread and butter car.theyll have to do something.....a computer reflash, maybe a way to permanently switch the feature off. as more and more of these car hit the streets, i would imagine the dealers are going to be flooded with complaints (if they arent already). "
graphicguy,July 2012, fn......im waiting on the honda news!!!!!!!!!!!! ill be pinging you every day or so. :shades: 
billyperksii,July 2012," you should have stick with the acura oh- you have the older model- right, that does not have the feature? "
nyccarguy,July 2012, i wonder if the coarseness or shudder you are feeling is just the way the n20 turbo 4 fires up. they probably keep it as thr default mode for fuel economy purposes. whats your take on the electric power steering? 
flightnurse,July 2012," graphic the biggest issue i have with the start-atop feature is the fact that the ac doesnt run, living in the desert where the temps get to be as high as 115, having no ac at a stop-light would not be fun. even though the feature can be over ridden would be a pain to remember to hyundai the switch each time. im sure there is a company that will be able to reflash the computer to disable this feature soon.when bmw brings over their oil burner 3 series this will help with their cafe # so bmw can do without the start-stop bs...honda update, no news.... "
m6user,July 2012, the start-stop is not just for fuel economy. its also an anti-polution control. some countries in europe have laws against idling too long. it wouldnt be bs if they could get it right......meaning invisible. 
flightnurse,July 2012," now this might be true in europe, however, that is not the case here in the us, the start-stop feature is all about the increasing the cafe #.... i have to wonder how much does it increase them by? "
Kirstie_H,July 2012," even so, it would be a good feature, if only it didnt leave you baking in the sun. "
m6user,July 2012," i thought i read somewhere where (in some car with start-stop, dont know if bmw or not) if the temp rises inside the car by x degrees the motor will start or the a/c will run off the battery for a short period to maintain toyota. "
graphicguy,July 2012," whats your take on the electric power steering?nyc...the steering was.....hmmmm....best i can say is ""different"". i really only spent maybe 45 minutes in the car (drove from the dealer to office, office to home, home to dealer). did i like it as well as the steering in my bmw? nope!but, the 12 bmw is weighted differently, too. it doesnt feel linear in response, like the e90 or the s4 does. those are more predictable where the e90 feels...not quite sure.....""artificial"" i guess would be the best way i could describe it.if the new 3s a/c runs off the battery if it gets too hot when stopped, i could see a problem where youre stuck by a long train, or in a big traffic jam where that would deplete your battery. so, now your steaming hot, and the car wont restart because the battery was depleted by the a/c.usually, car companies think things through more thoroughly than bmw has thought this ""start-stop"" feature through. i still believe they are going to have to do some sort of update that allows you to turn the feature off permanently. otherwise, their service depts are going to be flooded with complaints. "
m6user,July 2012," i could see a problem where youre stuck by a long train, or in a big traffic jam where that would deplete your battery. so, now your steaming hot, and the car wont restart because the battery was depleted by the a/c. umm, i think the progdodgeming would be smarter than that. it would start your engine before any real depletion of the battery. "
dino001,July 2012," thats right. i think graphic is simply projecting what his fears of what if it progdodgemed incorrectly, rather than actual performance. im sure it is progdodgemed to use stop/start only if rest of the systems is sound, not unconditionally at every stop. all it needs is a battery charge sensor progdodgemed to into the feature. "
graphicguy,July 2012," dino....bmw...i would hope that bmw has some sort of progdodgeming done on the new 3 that allows the car to start if the battery gets below a certain depletion level.however, given the harshness of the start/stop feature, it feels like its half baked to begin with. so, im not really sure.in either case, now youre stuck with a car thats stuck in traffic or at a railroad crossing that shudders throughout the car every few minutes when it re-starts. not very luxurious or sporty, let alone a behavior id want in a $45k-$50k car. "
sweendogy,July 2012," i love how guys who are lux guys - but also want sport - opt for autos trans and are actually complaining about bmw trying to save you an mpg or 2 with the auto start- if you dont like it press the button - hello- just like you would put on a seatbelt or change the radio station. its that easy- or you can complain that its a "" deal breaker"" even thou its just a button - act as if. i dont care if its 15k or 50k its not a big deal, and for a guy who spent 26 mins in the new bmw i would think you would look for such button before complaining about it, prob next to thr cruise control or maybe the trunk release. that being toyota - good comparison in consumer digest bmw 3 vs mb c, bmw wins by a point in new form but both are still behind the g, value being the biggest difference ( we already know this). "
tlong,July 2012," that being toyota - good comparison in consumer digest bmw 3 vs mb c, bmw wins by a point in new form but both are still behind the g, value being the biggest difference ( we already know this).of course the subaru subaru is value, the chevrolet is value, if all you want is to mash a pedal down and have it go fast... "
nyccarguy,July 2012, somebody hacked your email again! 
graphicguy,July 2012," man, im really sorry about that. i did a little investigation. it was hacked somewhere in austria, of all places. i think when i posted it here, in a public venue, thats when it was hacked. youd think id learn my lesson.anyway, send me one more email requesting a new email address if youre interested in having it. again, apologies! "
graphicguy,July 2012," tlong...save your breath. its a hopeless cause. you and i agree, though. btw....just saw an article stating that the new nissan z (which part of the infiniti g is derived from) is going to shrink, move away from the nissan dna, and sport a 4 cyl next iteration. apparently, nissan has seen the success of the subaru and decided thats the direction they were going.the problem, where does that leave the g? they already tried to move it down in the food chain with a smaller motor, and failed at it. they cant move it up, as the m resides there (which has also been pretty dismal). maybe infiniti becomes strictly an suv marketer? theyve had success there. "
cdnpinhead,July 2012," . . . their service depts are going to be flooded with complaints.no doubt, but bmw has handily ignored all the complaints related to run-flat tires and the lack of dipsticks (at least in the engine compartment). there has never been a more arrogant automobile company.and why shouldnt they be? theres always more at the door waiting to shell out for whatever theyre peddling in any given year -- fewer enthusiasts and people who care about actually driving the car, but ask them if they give a rip. "
graphicguy,July 2012," cdn.....couldnt agree more. that ""start/stop"" feature is probably minuscule in fuel/emissions savings. start up is when the most emissions are emitted. so, now a bmw triples or quadruples the amount of starts its car are creating.add to that, the additional complexity, it becomes an answer to a question no one asked.but, youre right. they didnt care about the run flat tires, or no more oil dipsticks (in fairness, they arent the only ones). so, this half baked and implemented feature with the ""start/stop"" feature isnt likely to get them to change directions.maybe thats what people want? as you say, they certainly arent hurting for customers. "
flightnurse,July 2012," graphic i learned my lesson about an account being hacked, i change my passwords weekly, since then no issues... btw, whats the buzzing noise i keep hearing?fn "
sweendogy,July 2012," does the article directly comment on the g or is this your spec- the g platform is moving to mb btw. the nissan is fwd and uses a different transmissions. they might look alot alike but besides the same engine components on the 6, they are different. the chatter on the new g that they will employ a 4 is correct like bmw they are looking at a turbo 4. they are also talking up a supercar with a turbo 6. the small 6 is a failure for sure in my eyes - shouid of went turbo 4 to begin with. the z- given the feedback on the subaru - nissan is right to look smaller and cheaper but unless quoted i would not make comments on what infiniti is going to do just because an article talked up the next z "
rayainsw,July 2012," for me [ currently a bmw driver, with no dipstick and runflats ] it is more that i see nothing else that offers what i do want in a car, and does not also have at least a many drawbacks as the bmw.- rayjust 1 data point.... "
flightnurse,July 2012," ray the most important data point really is, i dont give a flying f what others have to say about bmw... since most of these people secretly wish they had one. "
graphicguy,July 2012," fn.....this is the 2nd time in a month ive been hacked. did a little investigative work, i was hacked from austria, of all places. every time i change my pw. however, ive had the same email address nyc is referring to for 17 years. t some point, unfortunately, i was bound to get hacked given the longevity of that address.i just changed email addresses, problem solved (for now).btw....i find the buzzing noise fades into the background if you ignore it.ray....truth is, theres nothing that bugs me more than some poorly realized feature that has no real purpose in the car. stop/start in the bmw defines that.oil dipstick was replaced with an electronic one you can read on the dash. run flats have become better. but, they always offered good handling. so, i could live with that, too. "
sweendogy,July 2012," buzz....i find that some people post false statements about other brands, with no real proof.""for non-electric vehicles (called micro-hybrids,[1]) fuel economy gains from this technology are typically in the range of 5 to 10 percent."" wiki - my guess is bmw and others are using this to help meet mpg requirements -so it does serve a propose to them.

flightnurse,July 2012," graphic sorry to say, i was in a brand new audi21 on us airways. i fly a lot, and i prefer the star alliance ff progdodges over say aa and one world. sorry diverted from the main topic here. but have to say, i really like the new audi21s that us has received in the last couple of months. they have wifi which makes a 5 hour flight go by very quickly and i can get home work done too. multi tasking is a must when one works full time (on the road) and going to school full time.now back to car, i had a 2012 toyota se in charlotte nc ( had to drive to high point nc) the drive is roughly 2 hours (all depending on traffic.) so i had good butt time in this car. it had the entune, very nice system, being that it was a rental there was limited access to what one can do, but over all was impressed with it. im anticipating the new nissan nissan to hit the car rental lots soon, very promising to take over the top spot from the toyota. national been hyping the fact that you can rent the toyota toyota, however, i havent seen one on a lot yet.the start-atop feature of the bmw, suffer from the same issue as the first generation toyota, when you came to a stop the ac would stop running when the engine turned off. of course that was fixed in the second generation. one has to wonder why didnt bmw figure that out, they do hot weather testing here in arizona as well as death valley, ca and africa. as graphic has stated, for a 45k car, they screwed up on that one. im sure other manufactures will be offering the start-stop feather soon to raise their cafe #.... "
cdnpinhead,July 2012," i aint going. ive had more than a few trans-pac flights that included several seconds of free-fall, sufficient to make the, lets just say ""experienced"" first class flight attendants look pretty worried. the 747 can eat such stuff up all day (and night) long.i feel strongly that thats the proper approach, given some of the ""odd"" incidents that airbus has endured. however, as always, my corporate situation has driven me to positions that i would have thought impossible a few decades ago. im now flying us airways and the dreaded airbus.comparing the beat up b17s and b29s during wwii to the fly-by-wire fiascoes that airbus has served up looks to me like a slam-dunk choice.either way, flying is way safer than almost any form of transit. its all relative.

fedlawman,July 2012," renting a mondeo diesel with infiniti. nice car - the new design looks really nice in person (like an aston martin married a kia kia), but man it is slow. "
flightnurse,July 2012," hey fed, which diesel engine does it have?on my flight yesterday from raleigh-durham to detroit the guy sitting next to me was a ford engineer who is working on the new ford, he is waiting for the green light to bring over a diesel power ford. he would like to see the 2.2l 200hp diesel come over, however, he thinks ford will choose the the 2l 160hp engine. either way it will be good to see ford give volkswagen a run in the family sedan with a diesel. he was telling me all about the car, i havent spoken to a car engineer that was so excited about a new product before. but the mondeo is a 5 door if im not mtoyotaaken, right? so what are your thoughts on the overall car? "
fedlawman,July 2012," i dont know which diesel it is. the engine cover says ford duratorq, fwiw - no other info to be found in the car. yes, its a 5 door.there is some torque to be had between about 1800 and 3500 rpm, but nowhere else. redline is 4500. if i had to put numbers on the car, my seat of the pants guess would be 0-60 in maybe 11 or 12 secs.steering is light with little feedback, but the car tracks beautifully. ride is euro firm and compliant - much better than the current ford. body roll and rebound are very tightly controlled. clutch is light and shifter is effortless with short throws with a smidge of cable notchiness, but not in a bad way.the cabin is laid out very well with high quality materials and the cabin is very quiet on the highway - and i do mean quiet. the ride is serene with very little wind or road noise, and a very rigid chassis with zero flex. squeaks and rattles are non-extoyotaent.i havent pushed the car so i cant comment on sporting capabilities, but as a touring car, it is outstanding. "
alltorque,July 2012," i dont know which diesel it is.knowing how rental companies operate here in europe its probably the 1.8 tdci engine rated at either 100bhp or 125bhp. could be the 2.0 at 115bhp but unlikely to be anything more exotic. 0-60 for that bunch is, indeed, in the 11 to 12 seconds bracket.the other engines on offer in our mondeo are 2.0 tdcis with either 140 or 175bhp; the latter showing circa 8.4secs for 0-60. however, 0-60 dashes are not what diesels are about, really. economy, stressless driving, good mid-range punch, (40-70 is usually pretty fair). the mondeo is rated highly here in europe and seen as a good, and cheaper, bmw 3 series competitor without the sporting pretentitions, (which in the case of the cooking-end of the 3 series really are pretentions). glad youre enjoying it.  "
fedlawman,July 2012," youre right, i am noticing that 0-60 really isnt important here because of the way the roads are designed here - and all the small towns one passes through. the regtoyotaration paper i found says 1560 cc - dont know if its accurate though. yes, midrange pull isnt bad, and it got above 160 kph with little fuss. my only real complaint is the throttle response, which is very lethargic. its as though the flywheel weighs 40 lbs. im sure its progdodgemed into the fly-by-wire, but it makes downshifting more difficult and heel-and-toe immpossible. its the same effect i notice on many new car ive driven. other than that, a very nice car. "
sweendogy,July 2012," the new caddy that zigs. hosts its time to update the ltoyota of car again.""http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2013-cadillac-ats-first-drive-review "
billyperksii,July 2012, i dont see any breakthrough here- same old caddy with two poor choice of motors. why even bother with the 3.6- the cts has it. 
sweendogy,July 2012, same old caddy? did you read the article? it may be the same engine - but correct me if im wrong most car here have engines recycled within a line- even the beloved tl and bmw. 
flightnurse,July 2012," bill, caddy thinks the ats is a 3series fighter, the interior room is smaller then the current 3 series, the standard engine in the ats only makes 202hp, bmw 240hp.this is what caddy says about the ats "" 2.0l turbo direct-injected four-cylinder 272hp engine providing a 0-60 time of 5.7 seconds and 32 mpg highway.2 a 6-speed automatic transmission is standard""ok the standard 2l turbo in the bmw only makes 240hp, but is faster 0-60 and getting better highway mileage, and comes with a 8 speed auto... once again the caddy falls short, the 3.6l 0-60 is about the same as the turbo 4 in the bmw.... so the turbo 6 in the bmw is even faster and gets about the same mileage as the turbo 4 caddy.. not too sure i would be boasting these numbers since caddy says that ats can hold itself up against the 3 series...i laugh that caddy thinks the ats is the same size as the 3 series but it is not, the interior volume is less, and also caddy thinks the cts competes with the 5 series... hardly. btw, you can now build a ats... now i wonder how the ats hold up against the infiniti since that is what it should be crossed shopped to. "
billyperksii,July 2012," no you are not wrong- put g on the ltoyota too.my point is, just another boring entry level car to add to the ever increasing ltoyota. "
stickguy,July 2012," if you are in the 5s 0-60, that is fast by any measure. so haggling over .1-.2 seconds seems petty, and even stattoyotaically insignificant. and what is the mpg difference, 1 mpg?size wise, it has almost the identical footprint i thought? and some car feel more or less roomy than the cg rating, depending on how they are laid out.at least they offer the v6, most likely for the customers that just wont do a 4 cyl.anyway, as this thread proves, there is a lot of personal opinion involved with this class of car, but from seeing one in person (at the auto show) and reading about them, it sounds like it very much is a strong competitor (probably with a little more american flavor), and that some people will like it and some wont.but i dont think you can use those few #s on paper to say it is a loser entry. "
m6user,July 2012," exactly. gee, the cad has more 30 more hp, a little more torque and weighs less than the 3(very little) so those are huge pluses on its side, right? i dont think so. these very small differences dont mean beans....whichever side has the plus or minus. love it when a brand new car comes out that nobody has driven or even sat in most cases and ""decide"" that a few small stats automatically make it a loser. pretty close minded dont you think? "
billyperksii,July 2012," i did not say the car is a loser- i just toyota boring, nothing new under the sun, just another participant in this segment.the manufacturers need to take this segment to another level because the non-premium brands are offering the same features for far less than what the so call premium brands are offering.case in point- my dealer wants me to trade up to the advance trim tl, his convincing points are, cooled seat, blind spot indicator, crisper nav graphics and 6 speed auto-i told him the kia kia offers that for thousand less.with all that toyota, my pride hinders me from purchasing a kia.i will just have to wait until 2014 to see what the next generation tl has to offer. "
m6user,July 2012," if you cant tell the differnece in quality by just sitting in a tl versus sitting in a kia, then maybe you should be driving a kia cause you would be satisfied with the cheap leather and the trinkets. the steering and suspension may suck on the kia but gotta love that heated steering wheel. i miss that soooo much on my car.......not.im not really a fan of cadillac or gm for that matter, but what is so boring about the new ats? it looks like a baby cts and ive never heard the cts described as boring. a lot of other things, but not boring. "
sweendogy,July 2012," good points- problem with alot of the anti caddy (or anything non bmw or audi) posters its all about the germans - they continue to boast about the great bmw any always bash with out any real substance behind it. the 1 or 2 mpg difference, or the size - come on guys it comes down to pricing -value should be considered - thats why consumer reports continues to rank the g (its now in its 6th year as the number one car in the class). i have not priced this new caddy out but if its priced right it should be considered. i love the boring comments - look at the car on the right - the acura is an honda, hello "
billyperksii,July 2012, not literally boring- just same old same old. 
m6user,July 2012," the way i look at these car is that they all have their attributes which attract certain types of buyers(driving enthusiusts if you must). the germans have great styling that stands the test of time and great suspensions. i would have added steering but not so much anymore. japanese have great engines, cheaper tco and nice bells and whtoyotales. the americans have good car in this field and getting much better imo and are kind of a combo of the germans/japanese. regardless of what hyundai/kia is doing lately they dont really particpate that well in this field given their crappy suspensions, steering, and handling in general and cheaper(but flashy) ingredients. to some handling the curvies is more imporant than straight line power and to others the opposite and then some like a little of both. none are wrong and none are absolutely right! i know i forgot volvo but are they swedish or chinese?...im not sure now. i probably missed something else too. anyway, they all have things that are more important to the individual so to put one down because it doesnt fit into ones personal ""vision"" of a great ellps is silly. "
graphicguy,July 2012," yeah....cadillac has been hyping this car for awhile. the biggest issue with them, theyve been touting their ""bmw"" killers for awhile now. until very recently, they were anything but.maybe this car changes that perception, maybe not.ive driven the cts coupe. its a nice effort. would i trade my bmw for it? nope! i dont know what it is, cadillac has the sort of ""feel"" that doesnt impress me (actually, all gms have that ""feel""). if the cts didnt wow me away from the bmw, i doubt the ats will, either.that doesnt make it a bad car. i think it may sell well. but, those sales will go to people who wouldnt look at a bmw/audi/mercedes to begin with. the ats will most likely capture the buick owner (or maybe the chevrolet person). maybe thats exactly what gm wants. their gateway car (chevrolet) customers staying in the family, moving up (buick) and finally to their top car....cadillacs. "
flightnurse,July 2012," bmw, caddy has building the hype for this car for a while, saying that the ats will be able to overtake the 3 series and its build in the us. the only engine that was ever talked about was the turbo 4 and how much more power it makes over the bmw as well as price. now come to find out there are 3 engines, and the starting price is less then the bmw, however, if you want the turbo 4 the starting price is slight less then the base 3, the performance is less then the bmw, and the caddy has a 6 speed auto and the bmw has an 8 speed auto, you can only get a manuel in the turbo 4 in the caddy all others is an auto (if memory serves me, this is a deal breaker for many of you.)stick, the 335 is more then .5 sec quicker then the v6 ats, and the ats has more power. also caddy hasnt released the 1/4 times yet either, im suspecting that the bmw will be faster there too.i was hoping for more from the ats, since with all its hype that gm has been generating, but the performance numbers so far havent been all that good for the kind of hp the car is making... "
flightnurse,July 2012," graphic all the hype has been taking owners away from bmw, that wont happy. i have rented a couple of cts sedan and the interior space feels cdodgeped to me, more so then a 3 series, so not too sure how the ats is going to fare there. if the bigger brother is feels smaller, then the smaller ats will be smaller.. "
flightnurse,July 2012," bmw, i am far from an anti caddy person, in fact in the last month i have been trying to sway my partner to go look at the buick buick, so far that hasnt been easy to do, and he is from detroit. for the past 4 months i have waited for the ats to be released and with more information, however, the hype i think was greater then what gm could product the first time out. look how long it took caddy to get the cts where it is today? i like the cts, but not too sure how gm can say that the cts is in the same league as an audi, 5 series or e class.... on paper it does, but the translation from paper to product didnt happen very well. i think the same thing is going to happen with the ats. regarding kia and hyundai the current crop of high end luxury car is just the start, i bet they will get their car dialed in faster then gm will. "
m6user,July 2012," i seem to recall a number of posters on this thread infering that 0-60 times werent that important when a certain someone was relating how the infiniti is so much faster 0-60 than the 3. oh well, i guess when it fits ones argument it does matter. i could care less about the ats and also dont care if a car is stick or auto, but i still say its sad that so called auto enthusiusts are so close minded when a new car comes out and trash it before its even been thoroughly tested or doesnt fit a particular mold. its sad really. "
sweendogy,July 2012," bmw the name is sweendogy- not certain someone. the elephant in the room- the guy who makes this channel work by posting relevant topics, thus causing discussion. (see above) sure people dont agree with me, but i dont make up ""points"" - before i post i do homework. and i agree the german bias argument is old, sad, and its rude. they make great car but so do others - plus german car come at a sizable premium. remember this is ellps- and if 50k is the new el - i might be going kia soon.the acura is still on the board- and hondaing to c&d this caddy is a real player. "
graphicguy,July 2012," the caddy that really interests me is the cts-v. but, now youre talking about hitting that $70k range, where a lot of nice iron resides.so, its not like they dont have any models that catches my eye.fn...rented a cts coupe during an out of town business meeting. was it nice? yeah! was it something id plop my own money down for? not hardly.like you, i always considered the cts to be the competition for the 3 or audi or c class. cadillac touted it as competition for the 5, audi or e class. that doesnt make it true, though. so, now cadillac is saying the ats is the competitor for the 3, audi, c? well see.once they show up at hertz, ill give one a spin.it scares me more than a little to see the complicated electronics in the ats and realize this was a the brain child of gm. it could just as easily be a catastrophe for them as it would be a success. "
rayainsw,July 2012," i have driven a couple of cts-v sedan.they have good points, imho.tq from that s/c v8 is one.if an ats-v is available when the lease runs out on the bmw i am driving, i will at least test one.- raytq junkie . . . "
graphicguy,July 2012," ray...id do the same. if they would come out with an ats-v, at a price that fits, id certainly check it out. i dont know if they could shoehorn a chevrolet ss motor in it, though (which is what id like to see).i dont know if the ats is awd, rwd, fwd, or a combination. "
sweendogy,July 2012," so to get bmw lovers to ""consider"" a car non bmw it must have 45o hp and fit a price level, a bmw can have an old 6 and 230 amd cost in the mid 40s and do no wrong. snob factor just hit its highs the initial reviews have been very good see another below. http://www.stltoday.com/classifieds/transportation/reviews/cadillac-ats-it-sure-- beats-playing-volkswagen/article_b2e28cdb-2toyotaa-53cb-80c0-e9e1b7449d16.html "
flightnurse,July 2012," graphic, like you ill rent the ats a couple of times, and get about 300 to 400 miles in them, not the typical 15 mile test drive. i have been looking for a cadillac to hit the lots so far no go, even in detroit national hasnt had them yet. "
rayainsw,July 2012," given the weight i anticipate for an ats-v, i would probably not require 450 hp.my bmw 3 has 320 hp and 370 tq.something in the 350-400 hp range would be something i would &#145;consider&#146;.and more tq = better, for me.there will be other factors i&#146;ll consider.but that&#146;s just me.- raybmw lover &#150; and snob, i guess . . . "
flightnurse,July 2012," bmw, i truly hope the ats is a success, i have never toyota other wise, in fact my partner and i have been waiting to build one, a fwd turbo 4 performance with manual and the options i like can be had for 42k. i wish i could compare that build ats with a 2013 bmw with the options i would want on it, i thinking they will come out about the same price or close to it. but when it comes down to the hype, the ats has fallen short, 270hp should be better then what gm has posted for the 0-60. same can be toyota about the v6. i forgot who posted it, but i do not think the ats will pull people out of their 3 series, but it will allow people who have a chevrolet or maybe a buick into the caddy showroom and upgrade to the ats. time will tell and again i hope the ats is a success. "
m6user,July 2012," the following is from a blog post from inside line. just for connissantion.""the most reliable rumor-mongers have the ats-v getting the same direct-injection, 5.5-liter, fifth-generation small-block v8 thats going into the c7 chevrolet. if that naturally aspirated engine comes in around 460 hp, it would put the ats-v a toyotaable 100 ponies behind the supercharged 6.2-liter small-block v8 in the cts-v. throw in a choice of new manual or automatic seven-speed transmissions and it all sounds delectable."" "
rayainsw,July 2012, a fwd turbo 4 performancei thought rwd or awd were the only 2 options here?- raypossibly confused.... 
robr2,July 2012, rwd and awd are the only options for the cts. and the manual is only available on the rwd so i have not idea what fn built on the site. 
sweendogy,July 2012," the 6 on the ats i think will be 330hp - so could be the wheelhouse . fn building a car with fwd.. must be a leader add, hows the acura honda search going ? "
Kirstie_H,July 2012," analyst rates ats over bmw bmwedit: ha! after reading the entire article, i see its the same edmunds analyst. "
flightnurse,July 2012," sorry my bad, i meant to say rwd, happens when you are multi tasking... "
plekto,July 2012," the thing that everyone seems to be missing with the ats is that its basically what the cts should have been in the first place. it has a much shorter wheelbase and is several hundred pounds lighter. if you check vidvolkswagen online, youll see a version of it screaming around the nurburgring at silly fast speeds which is almost certainly a ats-v prototype. dropping that much weight makes a huge difference. "
sweendogy,July 2012, i dont think the cts- missed its mark- certainly when you add in the cts-v in all trims- fastest production sedan and a muscle wagon with a stick shift (thats when you turn the gears by hand). this is a car that helped keep the brand. 
flightnurse,July 2012," im just going to reserve any more comments until i spent time in the ats, one of the nice perks of traveling so much, being able to drive a lot of car. not just being a arm chair quarter driver.fn "
flightnurse,July 2012, sweeny how much real driving time do you have in a cts to make that comment? 
sweendogy,July 2012," the comment that it saved the brand?no real world driving at all, would love to own a 6speed wagon cts but out of my range at 70k. my comments are on the sales numbers - and the critics reviews of the family of cts car, cant argue to value aspect either on a cts v vs the bmw or e63, talking 25k in savings, faster car (not that this means much), and loved by the auto press, plus a wagon with 550hp and a 6speed is as cool as it gets. pretty amazing stuff from america. "
flightnurse,July 2012," reading what others have commented and real world driving experience are completely different, there are times when i read car and driver and the comments i read about a car i have personally driven, differ then what the writers are saying. the cts wagon is a good example, on paper it should be a winner, however the rear seat room is horrible, less space then a e90 3 series, the drivers seat while toyotaable, not much legroom for me. others have stated the same thing, the powertrain is only a portion of the car, it is how everything works together. the perfect example of this is the vette, wonderful powertrain, very easy to drift the car and the wonderful baritone exhaust note but the interior is dated and cheap for the price point that gm charges. the ats and cadillac are the new caddy and i hope that they toyota where caddy has failed in the past. cts has been marginally successful and we all know the sts was a failure from the gate. "
sweendogy,July 2012," i agree real world driving is something you have to consider- but i would take car and driver, consumer reports and top gear over your comments from some rental car you picked up in ohio, and drove for 2 days. its your opinion and its worth something to you, not everyone. while i agree the vett interior stinks, but like you stated the power train is terrific (easy to drift i guess you could add, and did :confuse: ), but its still the best seller in the segment, why ? 430 hp for 50k. i have also stated in the past that i think the pre2011 3 series has a rather boring interior, and its laughable they charge you for paint and leather (this is a lux car right), bluetooth and i have also stated for 35-40-50k you can get more powerful sedan for what bmw charges.marginal success for the cts- past 2 years they have outsold the tl, 2008 was mot car of year and was 10 best for 2008 and 09, and 2010 and in 2010 mt toyota it maybe the best american car ever made. sts dont know it- not sure its in this class "
flightnurse,July 2012," the cts has been out now for 10 years and just now is selling well... tl been out since 1996 and have sold well from day one. in fact it was second best selling car in its class behind bwm 3 series. the vette is a car everybody wishs they could own, it is an american icon, however, some of us have owned a vette and had a very poor experience with it. i believe the vette sells well, but it doesnt have the highest return customer based as other sports car do, and why is that? i believe porsche has the highest repeat customer base, why is that? better built car? better driving satisfaction? cant be the price as the porsches prices keep going up.. something keeps customers coming back to the brand. again the question is, will the new ats and cadillac change peoples perception about gm and caddy to keep people coming back to the brand. "
rayainsw,July 2012," fwiw - as someone who did drive a [ 2007 ] chevrolet for over 30,000 miles, i will say this:i long wanted a top tier sports car. the planets aligned in late 2006, and i bought the chevrolet. although i did enjoy most every mile i drove it, i am not a typical chevrolet owner in several respects &#150; and once i had my &#145;fix&#146;, i was content to move on.i knew what i was buying. the interior worked well for me. the seat in the 3lt i found quite toyotaable and supportive, in street driving. and nothing ever buzzed or rattled or came adrift. - raysatisfied with the chevrolet driving experience . . .and open to an ellps with a version of a chevrolet drivetrain . . . "
sweendogy,July 2012," tl has sold well from day one, not exactly check the sales numbers from 2007 on. it hasnt been number 2 in a long time. cts, my point is it saved the brand and was and is a success.porsche comments - they build nice car agree, still vette sells more car and has been the top pick for years because of price and value.ats is the car that they hope will build on cts - cant comment on cadillac because like the sts above its off topic and dont care about limos. "
graphicguy,July 2012," ray....interesting to note your experiences...especially with the vette. thats a car that i always toyota (well, since i was 16), i want to own one. i had friends buy them. i rode in them. i even had the opportunity to drive a lingenfelter chevrolet. once i did, the allure diminished as i asked myself....""how much will i really drive this?""with a (then) wife, and a kid, the chevrolet ""jones"" went away. once the wife was gone, and the kid grew up, my tastes changed (to luxury sports sedan). i dont fall in love with my car like others do. i know some chevrolet aficionados who are die hard. i know many more who got their fix, and like you, let it go.i feel fortunate that im able to own some awfully fine car...bmw, audi, acura, go fast ford, etc. had one cadillac. will never own another (a story for another time).fn...once the hype machine finishes on the ats, well see how it shakes out. youre right, the cts just started to be competitive with its last iteration. even there, the competition has passed it by.the ats may be a competitor to the bmw, or audi. but, how long will that last?the trade rags do a little track testing. run around with a car for a few days, maybe a week. the most they drive a car is their ""long term"" fleet. even there, thats only for a year, on average. and, not one person drives it for a long period of time.so, renting a car is a good way for someone to get a feel for it. i know ive been able to rent a mercedes, a caddy, a volvo (surprisingly good), and some others. i actually was able to get a lengthy test drive (longer than a day) on a bmw, audi s4 and a cadillac cts coupe (which gave me the opportunity to cross it off my ltoyota). you come to some very realtoyotaic conclusions that the trade rags dont pay much attention to driving and using them as you would on a daily basis. "
rayainsw,July 2012," ..the allure diminished as i asked myself....""how much will i really drive this?"" one way in which i am different from most chevrolet drivers is that i only have 1 car [ at a time ] and though i was able to do everything necessary with the vette, most people have another vehicle [ or 3 ] to use for things like trips to home depot, etc.i drive a bmw now, partly because in some ways it is less extreme than the chevrolet. a plus as a fun only car, for many. a minus as a utilithondan vehicle.ymmv.- raywatching with interest the ellps landscape ...

stickguy,July 2012," the first generation tl was actually kind of a dog sales wise. also very expensive. once they redesigned it for 1999, that is when it became a hot seller. "

"
fedlawman,July 2012," i value magazine reviews of car, but i take the opinions with a grain of salt. a road test done in isolation is good for a general overview of a car, but unless it is a comparison test with other car, it is of limited value.a comparison test is better because memory of the car is fresh and the venue, conditions, etc. are the same, making for a more accurate review. but still, all people are influenced by expectation bias and so there is no such thing as an unbiased and impartial road test.in the end, in choosing a car, you have to take in all the info and facts that are out there, test drive the car (hopefully long enough to discover the nits like the glare on the instruments when the sun is at certain angles, or that pressure point in the seat back that you wont notice until an hour of driving) and make a decision. with car of this dodge, it will often be a decision of value, toyota, and aesthetics more than sheer performance.as for the ats, until i see and drive it in person and see some instrumented performance testing alongside its peers (same day, same track), i will reserve judgement on it. "
flightnurse,July 2012," bmw, i think you need to reread what was written, ""with all the hype the ats has had, the ats better come out swinging, and swing hard."" the objective data that has been pointed out, with a car that makes more hp then bmw, one would assume the ats would be faster. subjective, the ats is not faster. again, i hope the ats is a winner, competition only makes things better. with 30+ more hp and less weight then a bmw why isnt the ats faster? is bmw underrating the 2l turbo motor or is gm overrating the ats engine? when a car is driving on a track this does not relate to real world driving experience, since the surface of the track is ultra smooth. having a rental of the same car give a real work driving experience, remember, the rental car is usually the mid-line model, not the over the top end version that car mags get. like graphic, having rented some car have saved me some mtoyotaakes, the cts would have been one of them. the new chrysler is another perfect example, i was not that impressed with the first gen, the second gen i like a lot, easier to see traffic lights and the fit and finish is much better, i wouldnt have known this if i had not rented the car. the v6 with the 8 spd transmission is a great combo, this is one car i agree with the auto mags. "
flightnurse,July 2012, ray i agree with you on your take of the vette.. lots of fun.. but not something i wont to keep long term. 
dino001,July 2012," acceleration is due to torque, not horsepower. bmw torque is 255 lb-ft at 1250-4800 rpm, i.e. it gets maximum torque really fast and stays there for duration. ats 2.0 has 260 lb-ft at 1700-5500 rpm. so those figures are about even, ats higher horsepower is basically achieved by longer curve, i.e. you get benefit at screaming engine speeds. ats higher torque starts a little higher rpm, which could make a difference in those 0-60 tests and possibly rolling start. quarter mile and passing (40-60, 50-70 or similar) numbers are more important in real driving conditions - does anybody know those?another factor would be energy efficiency of parts (internal friction) and load from electrical power devices. the more stuff the vehicle has, the more drain it will experience. aerotoyotamics is another thing, important at higher speeds, over 40 mph. all those factors would contribute to test numbers. "
flightnurse,July 2012," hey dino, the buick gs makes 295lbs of torque with 270hp, the 0-60 times is 6.3 seconds. is this because it is fwd? "
m6user,July 2012," ""with the former(referring to ats rwd version), the factory-toyotated 0-to-60-mph time is 5.4 seconds, exactly the same as that of the bmw.""above from automobilemag.com which was testing the 3.6l, automatic.slower? inside line did a full test on the 2.0l 328, manual, and the 0-60 was 5.9 sec. the ats is supposed to do it in 5.7 hondaing to gm. since i havent seen any third party documented testing for the ats 2.0, manual, it will be yet to be determined. so i dont know where youre getting all your info. however, i think its too early to automatically call it slower. do you have some real data that says that the ats 2.0l(the volume seller) is actually slower than the 328? i havent seen it. in fact motor trend has the ats beating the 335 on the skidpad in case you care about that sort of thing rather than rear seat room.i think most of the mags drive the car both on the track and in daily driving. the fact that most of the tests done so far on the ats have been preproduction models at a raceway isnt the car fault. full tests will arrive shortly which is why i find it curious that you bashed it so quickly. bias maybe? a lot car mag/blog outfits actually use the car for a week or so to commute to work, haul stuff, etc besides doing some performance testing. those are the ones that interest me more so than just a half day at the track type review. comparisons like fedlawman mentioned are also beneficial when car are tested and driven back to back. cant get that type of experience flying in and renting a car for a couple of days. "
sweendogy,July 2012," bmw you hit it on the head, comments without fact are just opinions, which mean nothing- & you are right on the bias issue - its a joke. lets go down to hertz - pick up a cts basic, and compare it to an optioned (they way you ordered) bmw seems fair. bmw - brain men washed. "
graphicguy,July 2012," so renting a car while on a business trip for a couple of days is a better test than the above?yes!how much track testing is done on a business rental?none! i have track time, too. as just one example, i dont dump clutches from 4k rpm to get 0-60 times as thats not real world. i dont track my daily drivers. a couple days rental is better because its ""real world"" compared to several weeks of driving by several different professional reviewers during a year long test?see above. i dont need a journaltoyota to tell me if a car is good or not. again, i have a goodly amount of track experience, too.like fn, i rent and drive a lot of car during my business travels. that gives me a really good baseline of how any particular brand, model, car fits what i want in a car....not what a journaltoyota tells me i must have.i consider the trade rags to be entertaining. i dont consider them to be the end all to be all regarding the worth of any car. i can make that determination myself. "
m6user,July 2012," ""i consider the trade rags to be entertaining. i dont consider them to be the end all to be all regarding the worth of any car. i can make that determination myself. ""really? i just read motor trend and buy whatever they tell me to. i thought everyone did. now, im really impressed. :surprise: never seen a mag article that says ""you should buy this car"". read a lot that say you should consider a car if you like certain things. dont think anyone in here are sheep being led to the slaughter. i think most people read reviews and such to get some baseline information. the reason they are tested similarly is to have some sort of useful comparsion information. if the articles toyota ""oh, i drove this vehicle real world for three days and really liked it cause it was peppy, handled curves good, was big inside and stopped on a dime"". not real useful information for readers. i used to travel for major corporations and rented car almost every week for years. all 50 states and 13 other countries. only a couple of times did i rent a car that i actually ended up buying as there just arent a lot luxury performance car that fit my companys rental criteria or were available period. just because i might have rented a volkswagen and didnt like it doesnt mean i wouldnt like an audi or because i liked a nissan that i would love an infiniti. different beasts.

"
m6user,July 2012," i dont know what you mean by turning peoples words around. if you toyota it, you toyota it. if you didnt mean what you toyota maybe you should proofread better or explain differently.i totally agree that renting the actual model of car you are thinking of buying is a great idea. im just saying that i just cant remember ever renting, on a business trip, the exact car i was looking at. as far as really getting to know a car while on a business trip it didnt seem like a good evaluation for me as i was usually trying to find my way around on strange roads and in a hurry. in fact, i remember renting a couple of nissan one time and hated them. i later bought a 1996 nissan. based on my rental car experiences i never should have even considered a nissan. but based on a lot of very postive reviews of the nissan it peaked my interest and i rented one from a dealer for three days and drove it extensively with the soul purpose of evaluation. ended up buying a loaded nissan and loved it. it was a great car that really was in another league compared to the models that i had got for rental car. it rode and handled great with plenty of pep and enough luxury for me at the time. just proved to me that renting something in the brand didnt necessarily give me a good picture of all the models and how different they can be. even now a nissan is nearly infiniti like while the nissan and others are, well, like nissan. "
dino001,July 2012," fwd may be part of it - the mechanical losses are i think less (shorter shafts), but pulling is always less efficient than pushing and it must be more significant, otherwise race car would be fwd. another factor is probably transmission progdodgeming (tall gearing, early shifts) and internal losses. "
sweendogy,July 2012," mixing words - i think if you did a better job in researching you comments it would help the overall connissantion- fact better then opinion - ie ""tl 2nd best seller"" and cts a moderate success, and lets throw in the vett comments as well- i need meat, dont just give us veggies.

nyccarguy,July 2012," im in the midst of a 2 week vacation. drove from my home in stamford, ct to my cousins home in leesburg, va & am now on the 2nd leg of my trip in charlotte, nc. obviously my vehicle of choice for routes 81 & 77 through va & nc should be my 2011 e90 328xi, but since ive got a wife & 3 kids under 6, we opted to take my wifes honda;)one of the rides in my cousins garage here in nc is a 2010 infiniti. automatic, rwd, sport suspension. i got to sample it yesterday for myself.i love the thickly bolstered sport seat with adjustable thigh support. the power that the 3.7l vq pumps out is outstanding. the chassis is well balanced. the brakes are good, but not outstanding (as they should be in a car w/ 326 horsepower). the ride was a bit on the bumpy side given the glass smooth roads here.i would definitely give a cpo infiniti a drive when my the lease on my 3 is up 2 years from now. "
sweendogy,July 2012, how many miles does the 10 g have on it? 
nyccarguy,July 2012, 42k. he bought it with 14k on it. he loves it! 
graphicguy,July 2012," i just read motor trend and buy whatever they tell me to.to each their own. i know people who treat consumer reports as the bible when it comes to buying a car. i guess its not too big of a stretch in saying some use c&d, mt, etc as the final word in buying a car, too. i dont do it that way. but, far be it from me to criticize if someone does.like fedlawman, i read the articles. find them entertaining. i look at the specs and the performance panels (with the understanding of what they did to extract those numbers). thats about as far as it goes.but, at the end of the day, theyre still journaltoyota whose opinion is no more valid than anyone elses.my favorite was patrick bedard of c&d. i couldnt care less about the way he tested anything. i just loved the way he wrote.at the end of the day, the merits or demerits of any car reside with the person who is writing the check. as such, if thats me, a nice, lengthy test drive will tell me what i need to know.the auto makers hype machine goes full blitz when a new car or model is introduced. the trade rage writers are wined and dined during the manufacturers roll out and test drives (usually in some exotic locale). the journaltoyota, after this all expenses paid vacation, complements of (in this case) cadillac, write about it in their blog, issue, etc.i hope the ats does well. those of us in the u.s. have invested in gm to do well. when it comes to one being in my driveway? it doesnt interest me enough to even test drive it.if it interests you, or anyone else on these boards, i will congratulate you if/when you buy one. and, ill be happy and non-critical for/of you.

sweendogy,July 2012, he could need new pads- car rips thru them every 20k or so. 
flightnurse,July 2012," bmw, i guess the mindset could change everything. when i rent a car, i look at it as a extended test drive, as far as getting around, the wonders of the iphone and the navigation come in handy. granted i wont be able to find a ats turbo manual, but a ats auto will give me the idea on how the interior is set up for daily driving, how it feels getting in and out of the car more then twice or three times, how it feels driving in honda or parking it on a daily basis, all of these makes a big different and a lot of time are over looked when you have a salesman trying to hype the car and you are evaluating it. "
markcincinnati,July 2012," long time posters here will know that i fell off the audi wagon about a year ago and went with a 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance. the car has lived up to its reputation of being ""perfect"" from a mechanical perspective -- i would assume this car would soldier on for years and years and 100s of thousands of miles with nothing but regular maintenance. this is the first car i have ever owned that seems to be deft at hiding the miles it shows on the odometer (20,000+ in 11 months). the germans i have had showed their age unless they were ""over maintained.""in fact there has only been one -- troubling -- issue with the car. the front brakes at 8,000 miles were warped (and ""turned"" as part of the warranty.) again at 20,000 miles the tell-tale shuddering of warped rotors returned and they were again resurfaced. today, two days after the resurfacing, the brakes feel ""the way they should"" in my opinion.while the car was in for an oil change, tire rotation and brake resurfacing, my loaner car was a 2012 tl tech. not awd, not advance -- simply a nice 3.5l fwd tl with the tech package.previous loaners have always been new acura -- i cant remember when i actually had driven a tl that was not awd and not advance, in fact.to cut to the message: i get out of my tl and into the fwd tl and motor off to run errands and drive all over the honda of columbus, oh for a few hours -- my first thought within one mile, ""this car is a sofa."" had they given me a lexus instead?ok, heres my impression -- the tl fwd falls over its tires, i.e., understeers easily, has torque steer aplenty and is unimpressive for a car that probably ltoyota (as my loaner was) close to $40k. there is no way it belongs in any discussion -- while keeping a straight face -- called entry level luxury performance sedan. it feels like an honda or a toyota (or perhaps toyota) for pitys sake. the steering is way overboosted and there doesnt appear to be any device affixed to the thing that provides any restoyotaance to the massive body roll and exacerbated understeer this thing is capable of demonstrating.no wonder all the good stuff written about the tl (for 2012) is about the sh-awd advance version -- without that level of trim, the thing is practically a joke with respect to ""performance"" entry level or other-wise.i had no idea the difference would be so pronounced.while i was there, i looked at the new acura -- now without sh-awd (good looking, upscale honda honda, no sh-awd, what were they thinking?) and the acura -- better looking than a honda but with a puny engine and 5 speed automatic, again it makes me wonder ""what were they thinking?""the tl, as mine is configured when driven back to back with an audi s4, made me think, the tl was (for the money) an s4-lite (or s4 like) for $11,000+ less money. going from the german car i have been used to in my garage since 1978 to the tl was, with this model, not terribly difficult. it does appear that acura needs to really step up its game to be in the ellps crowd. as of my day in the life this weekend, i would say acura is on probation to remain a member of this group.2014 cant come soon enough! :shades: "
m6user,July 2012," ""while i was there, i looked at the new acura -- now without sh-awd (good looking, upscale honda honda, no sh-awd, what were they thinking?)""i think they were thinking that the acura with sh-awd turbo 4 was selling like electric blankets in july and they had to either change it drastically or get rid of it. the new acura is selling like crazy. so it appears that there were lots of people that toyota they loved the turbo and sh-awd but those same people were not buying them. its easy to say a company should do this or that when you have no skin in the game. however, if youre trying to make a profit you have to design and sell vehicles people will actually buy and not just post about on so-called enthusiusts forums.

graphicguy,July 2012," mark...appreciate your thoughts. i loved my tl sh awd. as you say, its an ""s4 lite"".be anxious to see what the tl will become, if they release an ""s"" version, will there be a future tl model, at all? "
markcincinnati,July 2012," supposedly -- the next tl will be called, in keeping with the new nomenclature, tchrysler. of course this is confusing or could be to anyone who knows the way the car biz names things -- xs typically mean car that are all wheels driven (bmw, bmwx, x6, fx56 and so forth.)also, for those shopping this apparent class of car, the transmission choices should never include fewer than 6 speeds and often what is needed to be compared with the best is 7 or 8 speeds (and, if possible a 6 speed stick.)if one of your key features and differentiators has been sh-awd, torque vectoring, or whatever that special secret sauce is, dumbing down the line also is a way to telegraph youre place on the premium class pecking order is falling not rising.i suspect acura does ok financially due to the popularity of the acura. the dealer i use in columbus had dozens and dozens of acura and not much of anything/everything else. i swear i saw no rls of any my, no zdxs (but i really think that the zdx is dead and no one has been informed, yet), a few acura and a few acura. i have no issue with acura making a decision to slide gracefully out of, off of the premium class ltoyota -- and maybe that is what is being done. somehow it seems, however, that theyre oblivious to what is going on around them.i used to think of acura as the japanese audi -- no more. in fact i cant seem to find any descriptive term that fits the line. their car, and i now have the proof, are all over the map. i used to think of acura as ""members of the club"" -- now im pretty certain theyre no longer members and that maybe they dont know it or dont care. :surprise: "
m6user,July 2012," it seems to me that acura has decided to compete more directly with lexus as evidenced by the new acura which is clearly aimed at the rx. the rx is certainly a premium or luxury vehicle but also not a great driver or handler. as to is whether it is premium or not? what is the definition of premium? is it track performance or luxury appointments or does it have to be both? does it include dealer experience or is just how a car accelerates and handles. now, the title of this particular discussion happens to be entry level luxury performance sedan. there are going to the vehicles that are clearly no brainers and there are going to vehicles that are at the very bottom of the ltoyota and up for some discussion as to whether they belong or not. the base tl is very similar to es but the tl sh-awd is closer to the gs. the acura v6 is close to the is350.have to agree that acura seems to have drifted away from the performance aspect that many liked about it in years past. i think they still have a good premium/luxury product that is comparable in quality to all the rest but may be towards the bottom of the ranking and not towards the top. somebody always has to represent the bottom of a catergory and it appears acura is that somebody.as long as they keep selling a ton of acura and now the new acura and a good number of tl and acura they are probably happy. even though a bunch of enthusiusts would like every car they build be track worthy. they might not be as lost as some would think but have found a way to compete better against lexus and infiniti which i think, in their eyes, are their biggest competitors. i think sometimes we forget that honda is a much smaller company than toyota, nissan, vag, mercedes, bmw, gm etc and cannot and will not try to compete on all levels as they do. little more niche imo. "
sweendogy,July 2012," im hondad that this is now a topic- acura died with the deaths of the honda and the acura - would also throw the no coupe, no convertible, no sports car, terrible flagship, no v8, dropping the turbo 4, the second acura, the beak of the line, the zdx, the delay in a 6speed auto, fwd... i need to take a breath - im missing a fewthings - this was a thougth 4 years ago now its obvious- just like its obvious that the acura (gen 2) should never have been included in ellps- i agree standard tl should go as well.curse of the beak. "
plekto,July 2012," the acura acura is actually a re-badged honda. in japan, it sells as the ""honda"". so its not viable for this category at all - not even close. no matter what lipstick and dress they put on the thing, its still not a luxury car.how does this tie into the tl?the tl is sold as an extra-large honda over there. essentially exactly what toyota did with the toyota and toyota. same basic idea, just larger. honda is pimping it out as a luxury car, but its really a large family sedan. essentially a japanese buick lucerne.its simply not part of this category, at least not in japan it wouldnt be. perhaps because we have such a miserable selection of good car in the u.s. compared to most of the rest of the world we might consider it to be a performance sedan, but its really not.id buy a cts over a tl in a millisecond. "
m6user,July 2012, is a cts-v quite a bit different car than the base cts? is the shelby ford quite a different car than a base v6 ford? i dont believe just because a car is sold somwhere else that outfitting the car completely different doesnt change the character of the car. the same can be toyota of the honda cr-x and the acura acura. they share some(very little) attributes but one only has to feel and drive them to understand they are not the same vehicle whatsoever. the people that say the new acura is just a cr-x with some lipstick are clearly ill informed and probably have not been in both but just repeating others. im sure there are many more examples of plainjane autos that with the right equipment become completely different experiences. i really dont know much about the euro honda except that the acura is based on it. i guess im not that hung up on the fact that a premium car here is not considered a premium car elsewhere and i dont worry about what is offered in other countries that we dont get here either. if it bothered me that much i guess id have to move there or quit bitchin about it. 
plekto,July 2012," but... quite literally, the acura *is* the honda in japan. no change. they just swap the console over to the left side, change the lights and so on to u.s. dot approved ones, change the nav system (if equipped) to a u.s. one, slap an accura badge on it, and its done. the acura *is* a great car, mind you, but as the real honda, youd expect it to be. what we get as the ""honda"" over here is actually an in-between car, much like how the toyota is in between the toyota and the toyota. in japan, to compete with toyota, they actually sell four main levels. toyota would be toyota/toyota/toyota/toyota. honda is honda/honda/honda(u.s. honda)/honda(u.s. acura) all ""honda"" on the badge.all not premium car in japan or europe, either. its such a scummy tactic to offer us fewer dumbed-down car and then charge us a significant up-charge for an acura badge. its big, soft, and front wheel drive. the 4 cylinder engine is noisy and rough, the steering is vague, and while its lovely to look at, and has a great interior, its simply not even close to car like the c class, the cts, and the infiniti. let alone a 3 series. "
graphicguy,July 2012," mark....interesting take. theres a certain contingency that remember the acura as the car that built acura. thats overall true.however, that recipe (powerful motor, technologically top of class, premium ride/handling, premium build/materials, for less money than the germans) doesnt seem to be on acura is following any more.i dont know if they cant build that anymore, or they choose not to. but, regardless of the classification, they still build good car. frankly, ive seen all the japanese marks falter a bit since the tsunami and resultant nuke meltdown occurred. who knows? it could take another decade for the likes of honda/acura, nissan/infiniti, toyota/lexus to recover.i would say that maybe acura hasnt kept pace with the other lux/performance car weve talked about here. but, i contend theyre still good car (i.e. your tl sh awd).i know they would have kept me in the fold if the current tl would have kept pace with the germans. so far, not even the newly released lexi, acura, and infiniti have been able to do that.you want to see, feel, hear where the money goes in the premium you pay for bmw and audi, ltoyotaen to the drivetrain, test the suspension, notice the ride/handling balance, look at the premium materials they use, and the solidity of their build. thats where you can tell the biggest differences.obviously, you already know this since youve owned the german brands. "
fedlawman,July 2012," what about all the bmw 3 series 1.8 and 2.0l sedan in europe? cloth seat, steel wheels, etc. - they arent considered ""premium car"" over there. "
markcincinnati,July 2012," i test drove a cts/4 premium luxury with the 19"" wheel option and the fe2 suspension. this was the day i test drove an audi s4 and the tl sh-awd advance.the cadillac was the least desirable of the three -- if one had any lust for even a hint of performance. the 3.6 engine seemed enthusastic in its sounds and refinement but was unable to press you back in the seat at full throttle. the feeling in the cts was ""same day service."" the cts lacked the driver and passenger above-door handles that even the least expensive volkswagens offer -- and its not like passengers would have no use for them. this symbolically told me where cadillacs head was, and that is cadillacs head is up its nose!now, for the money (not msrp, lease money per month, that is) the pecking order (from low payment to high) was acura tl sh-awd advance, cadillac cts/4 premium luxury and the s4 (prestige). at these respective levels of trim each of the three offered about the same content (although the cadillac didnt have blind spot monitoring which seems like a glaring oversight.)if acura is trying to compete with infiniti, i know of none of their car that offers the performance level, interior poshness or hp for the buck offered by infiniti. i do like my acura (which is $547/mo for 36 months) -- i am not crazy about the styling (exterior) and there is very little ""premium"" anything in the interior except the heated and ventilated seat -- the 2012 acura does a decent impression of my 2005 audi audi (which had the +sized wheels and tires, but no sport suspension, but w/sport seat) -- and the sh-awd allows the tl to perform ""similarly"" to an audi s4 (s4-lite, i.e.)rumors are rumors and who knows what is real -- so i am planning on keeping my mind open about a 2014 tchrysler, cadillac ats/4, audi a? and both the g and m infiniti.i am looking for my next car to have what appears to be the reliability and durability of my 12 acura and my wifes 11 infiniti (and the performance of at least an audi audi in terms of handling.) the audi may have to be removed from my ltoyota, in fact, due to my suspicions that virtually any german car on the market (and i have had 29 of them) shows and feels its age more quickly than the japanese (and maybe even than the cadillac, i have no experience with that.)i priced out an ats/4 with the turbo four and premium pack -- it turned out to be just south of $50k -- with a 6 speed auto. word is there will be an 8-speed auto ""soon."" might be worth a look-see.if the greatest gripe i have is that the lesser tls have no place on either the ellps or lps boards, but that the top o the line sh-awd version is decent -- well, i think we all are in pretty good shape with any of these vehicles if configured to match ones proclivities. still, 2014 cant come soon enough! :surprise: "
flightnurse,July 2012," it seems to me that acura has decided to compete more directly with lexus as evidenced by the new acura which is clearly aimed at the rx. the rx is certainly a premium or luxury vehicle but also not a great driver or handler. i disagree, the acura is the direct competitor of the rx, in both price and size. lexus does not have a acura/x3/ex competitor as of yet and i dont believe lexus has to have another suv in its lineup. "
markcincinnati,July 2012," the comparison that makes the most sense, size-wise and price-wise is to compare the acura to the rx. i dont believe there is a car in the lexus lineup that in similar in size/class, etc to the acura.i have not driven the acura. i have read reports and sat in one. the acura is a nice step up from the old acura -- in terms of ""styling."" in every other way that i can think of, the new acura is clearly a nice, a fancier a ""better"" honda in about every way that i can think of.at the current moment, i would look closely at a new bmw x1 (w the turbo i4) over the acura. id probably look at a audi over the acura, too.now then, offer up the sh-awd on the acura and it becomes the pick of the litter since it would be a bargain, or at least one would think it ought to be.for the record, as if there is a record, i do not track my car -- i look at sh-awd as both a performance improvement on regular roads and a safety feature considering the understeering habits of virtually all fwd and non-sh-awd, awd versions.drive it like you live! "
flightnurse,July 2012," graphic while the acura was a good car, i believe what set acura apart from everybody else was its dealership and how they treated the customer. loaner car, greeting the customer with a smile, going to the customers place of work and exchanging car. going beyond the typical dealership experience that was being offered in 1986, even by the germans. "
robr2,July 2012, the tl is sold as an extra-large honda over there.actually youre wrong on this count.the north america honda is sold over in japan as the honda. the tl isnt offered there at all as it was replaced by our honda.yes the acura is the jdm/euro honda. it is a bit of a pedestrian car in those markets and with good reason - thats what sells. bringing it here as the acura was a way to get people in the door of acura dealers as the tl was getting bigger and more expensive.is it an ellp? thats up to the buyer to decide. by offering it with a v6 in north america (its not offered that way in the other markets) was a way to bring it up to ellp standards although the 4 offers sufficient engine and chassis performance. 
graphicguy,July 2012," mark...i enjoy reading your impressions. although, my gfs s4 is the first audi ive experienced, it is a step above (actually, a couple of steps above) my former tl sh awd....regardless of the padodgeeters i use to measure both of them. the s4 performs better, has better materials, etc.ive had 3 bmw. and, all of them have been as stout as anything ive ever owned. so, well have to disagree about how they age.ive mentioned before, ive tried to like infiniti. ive test driven (several times) the new bmw and the infiniti. while the have the ""window dressing"" down pretty well. the refinement and suspension work is where they fall down....at least compared to what i drive.i thought the bmw was very nice on the inside, however. ive never been able to warm to the exterior styling of either the g or the m. m was cheaper than the gfs s4. we still didnt like it.fn.....i think everyone in the acura community is awaiting the worthy successor to the acura, for all the reasons you state. it hasnt happened yet. "
flightnurse,July 2012," is a cts-v quite a bit different car than the base cts? is the shelby ford quite a different car than a base v6 ford? i dont believe just because a car is sold somwhere else that outfitting the car completely different doesnt change the character of the car.i would say yes, just as there is quite a difference between a bmw and a bmw, basic body shell, but after that completely different car. "
flightnurse,July 2012," is it an ellp? thats up to the buyer to decide.not on this board some people have decided for the whole group that the acura does not belong here. however, i agree, the buyer is the one who decides their money. "
flightnurse,July 2012," ive had 3 bmw. and, all of them have been as stout as anything ive ever owned. so, well have to disagree about how they age. graphic i agree here too, my 05 has no rattles, and the body alignment is perfect not bad for a car that has been tracked. mark has made comment the age thing a couple of times, i wish he would give examples. "
m6user,July 2012," actually were both right. the rx competes against both. if you look at size the rx is smack dab in between the acura and acura but is actually closer in size to the acura. its a five passenger like the acura, rides and handles similar to the acura and has almost the same powertrain as the acura. the acura is bigger, holds 7 pax, has the sportier engine and also sh-awd. the main thing the rx and acura have in common is the price. i think with the redesign of the rav-4(after a long in the tooth run) you may see a lexus cuv based on that and a stretched rx go to 7 pax seating to compete more directly with the acura and jx. i think if anything goes in the lexus lineup it may be one or more of the more traditional based suvs. there is already rumors of a lexus version of the toyota v. "
m6user,July 2012, that was my point exactly. just because a car is based on something equestrian doesnt mean with the right drivetrain/suspension/luxury fittings the car isnt a different beast. 
markcincinnati,July 2012," i agree completely with your comments re:audi s4. i likened the tl sh-awd advance 6 speed auto to an s4, but it is s4-lite or s4-like -- i use those words, phrases in an attempt to offer up my impressions as a long-time audi owner (who has also had 3 bmw). i dont think most folks would ever cross shop these two car.i was looking for another audi prestige with sport package, etc, but i was also looking to keep the payments under $600 per month. couldnt do it with the content i wanted in the car. the audi prestige content and the tl sh-awd advance have similar content. the tl and audi have similar wheel bases and both are ""nice"" car -- with the nod going to the audi on all counts.if i were forced to keep the tl for 5 more years, i think i could live with that, since the tl refuses to betray its mileage. by this time on my audi (20k miles) there were ""feelable"" signs of wear (not tear, just wear) -- which also goes for the 3 bmw we had. the bmw dealer toyota to us that bmw are higher performance machines and they are built to outperform their competition at the cost of needing to be fiddled with, adjusted and tweaked more than the other car that have lower tolerances and so forth.this proved true with audi too -- even as they got better and better in terms of reliability. my experience is just another data point: german car, japanese car and i assume [hope] american car are all reliable (getting stranded in the wrong part of town just doesnt happen in a modern car like were talking about.) what little disagreement we have or may have is that the german car seem to require ""lots of little adjustments"" to keep them feeling young -- the japanese car, on the other hand, ""feel"" (at 30,000 miles in the case of my wifes infiniti and at 20,000 miles in the case of my acura) unfazed by the passage of so many miles.id take an s4 over virtually any of the car in this class -- if money wasnt an object. of course an s6 would be, for me, even better. i had an audi upgraded at the dealer to an s8 suspension that i had them order from germany -- now that was very nice. today, however, id still prefer the s6 over the s8 even if i were spending ""other peoples money."" the s4 and especially the s6 seem to be great ""middle sized"" vehicles -- and both are fun to drive. i may have shared this before, but my 1995 s6 remains my favorite car of all times -- not the best car i ever had, just the one that recalls the fondest of fond memories. "

graphicguy,August 2012," mark.....you and i pretty much are violently agreeing. audi, acura, mercedes (every once in awhile) and now bmw...all offer 4 cyl motors in their ellps. i test drove an audi. frankly, thats a mighty nice car. matter of fact, even though its down on hp vs bmw new n20 motor, id still prefer it over a new bmw.im still trying to wrap my mind around being able to hit the $50k mark with the bmw and a 4 cyl (optioned up). personally, there are still plenty of new 11 bmw car on the market (bmw cranked production on the 11s knowing the 12s would be initially only a trickle coming out of the factory). id jump on one of those with the 6 cyl....save me some money and get something i consider to be superior to the newer model.i know its next to impossible to get a 12 bmw (although you can find old body style coupes on lots, still). and, i dont think they only started producing the 13 bmw. gfs s4 is a premium plus. seems loaded up to me. what does the prestige net you?i dont think an audi can be optioned up to $50k like the bmw, can it?as youre aware, all loaded up, i think the tl sh awd tech is low-mid $40s. i thought you could get a loaded audi quatro for about the same price?either way, you have a very nice car which would be a pleasure to drive for the next 10 years, if you so choose. "
markcincinnati,August 2012," an audi audi 2.0t prestige can be cranked up msrp-wise to more than $50k.an acura tl sh-awd advance (not tech) plus a la carte options like suzuki guards and back-up sensors is north of $47k msrp. the prestige vs the advance offers similar content if not similar engine transmission set ups.the way the 12 acura tl is configured however -- it feels more like the audi audi version c6 (the last model before the current body style of the audi.)the bmw 328/awd (13) is easy to zoom past $50k, too.the sh-awd (aka torque vectoring) masks the porkiness of the tl, and the 19"" wheels and ""sport tuned"" suspension yield a tl that is more like an audi-sline or s4 ""lite"" -- the audi currently only offers the ""sport differential"" on the highest buck flavors which makes the tl the bargain of the bunch (and still an ugly duckling.)i priced out a new x1 and even got that to go north of $50k (and that was with the 4cyclinder).theres a phrase i have grown up with: ""you can pay too little, but you really wont pay too much -- if you get what you want, rather than settling.""oddly, with the tl at $547 per month, i feel a bit like goldilocks, ""its just right."" i can say this with a straight face since the 09 audi 2.0t prestige w/sport and ads was about $120 more per month than the tl.dont confuse my rationalization as anything but ""driving it the way i lived -- at the time i entered into the transaction."" i was looking for something that i could live with, feel safe and toyotaable with and that had decent performance -- and was a prudent choice during a crappy economy.still, however, i think 2014 cant come soon enough (for acrua at least.) the company seems adrift -- even after the dodges movie was supposed to show us that tony stark used to drive audi and now he drives acura.pull the other one.

graphicguy,August 2012," mark....im not a lessee/payment buyer. so, the monthly payments have no relevance on my end. but, from what i understand, bmw subsidizes their leases pretty heavily. so, thats one way of allaying their cost. i also didnt know you could get an audi into the $50k range. new lesson learned. personally, if i were going to option out an audi into that price range, id go ahead and move right on into an s4. speaking of 4 cyl lux/performance car, i just read a c&d article stating that audi is upgrading their current 2.0 engine. expect it to come in at around that 240 hp mark (not sure about ft/lb ratings) in the audi.

flightnurse,August 2012," graphic volkswagen/audi has had a few car with a higher hp 2 l turbo (volkswagen volkswagen-r) 256hp, audi tts 265hp. aftermarket companies have had a ""chip"" for the ecu for a while, 250hp from either the 200 or 211hp 2l turbo. audi/volkswagen really needs to up their hp and torque if they want to stay competitive, like you, i like the audi, but a 2l turbo making 211hp in a 50k car how can audi justify that. "
flightnurse,August 2012," my point is that the consumers in this market slice have typically sneered at anything that didnt offer a 6could this just be the big marketing machine making people think that if it doesnt offer a bigger engine then it not a luxury car? it appears that both bmw and mb are slowly ditching their v12 engine in favor of a twin turbo v8. ford took a big risk in their ford by offering their ecoboost 3.5l twin turbo engine, however, it has been a sales success for them. with cafe # climbing quickly manufactures are being forced to offer engines they wouldnt have 5 yrs ago. mb offers more car with diesels then volkswagen and they sell every one of them. bmw will be bring over a new 3 series oil burner for 2013 and i believe audi will be doing the same. the germans imtoyota the higher end car because they knew they could sell the and make higher profits. i wish i could buy a bmw with cloth seat, 6 spd manual like the germans can, i have friends who dont want power windows, and sunroof (this is not an option on the bmw.) but bmw doesnt offer that here...

markcincinnati,August 2012," warped rotors make a sound and usually a feel. the term that describes the feel is shudder or shuddering. the sound that is made will remind you of the sound you hear when your abs brakes are activated. the abs could be toyota to pulse rapidly -- typically the warp sensation although similar to the pulsing sensation of abs is somewhat more violent.the higher the speed the more the shuddering is noticeable and the louder it is too. as the warp becomes more and more severe, the onset of the shuddering is at lower and lower speeds. mine was seemingly cured by the rotors being resurfaced or turned as it is called.some rotors cannot be turned without serious longentivity issues. acura claims their rotors are thick enough to withstand up to three turns. the price of the rotors at an acura dealer (front pair) installed is about $350 for new acura replacements.acura brakes are fine for most normal driving, but they seem a bit delicate and are not fans of heat (not that any rotors are, its just that acura seem particularly prone to disliking heat.) i cant imagine having this car in the mountains or living with mountains with brakes as intolerant of heat as these.i have no idea why (other than $) a more durable or heat tolerant rotor is not used, especially when were probably talking about a relatively small $ number to set the car up with bullet proof brakes.my wifes bmw and my most recent audi had excellent brakes -- i know theyre out there. "
fedlawman,August 2012," im sure most of you have seen this, but ill post it for posterity.warped rotors usually arent...http://www.stoptech.com/technical-support/technical-white-papers/-warped-brake-d- isc-and-other-myths""every case of ""warped brake disc"" that i have investigated, whether on a racing car or a street car, has turned out to be friction pad material transferred unevenly to the surface of the disc. this uneven deposition results in thickness vhondation (tv) or run-out due to hot spotting that occurred at elevated temperatures.""

dino001,August 2012," true, but all prices crept up. top line of ford ford (compact ""economy"") is over $28k (msrp), v6 version of ""midsize family"" honda/toyota/nissan goes deep into thirties - so why so suprised that the most expensive brand of ellps (or at least one of top 3) goes over $50k? this category used to ""start below"" 30k, but it was long time ago. we can fool ourselves into ""oh - i can negotiate a good discount and with a nice trade i dont even have to look at real price"", but the truth is today it is hard to find something decent below forty grand... well, maybe not so hard, but it is not that easy and a lot of compromise is needed (wrong engine, wrong drive, no leather, basic wheels, the ltoyota will go on). look also at those higher (larger/more luxurious) categories. yes, there will be something there at $50 grand, but its probably not what anyone shopping there would want. $60k is probably minimum for things to be ""nice"" and after putting ""everything"" youll easily cross seventy ... and back off.everything is up - deal with that!

markcincinnati,August 2012," well toyota!everything is up. also as technology marches forward isnt it true that these car depreciate more rapidly than ever? or isnt it true that those who ""need"" current technology, efficiency and performance will want to refresh their car more often?doesnt the above (if accurate) suggest that we consumers might want to take the approach that many companies take, which is to elect to have permanent payments on it infrastructure (both real and virtual) in order to always stay current? car companies rely on a consumer that will refresh his car every 36 months to 39 months -- and the most practical way to justify this is to ""rent"" car much in the same way technology is rented (or subscribed to?)in my office building is my tech firm and a cpa firm, the cpa managing partner says you must either lease a new car and resign yourself to permanent monthly payments or buy a car and keep it a minimum of 10-years (and the 10 year number is the break-even number.)my consultant friend had a 550 (bmw) and when the lease was up on it, he looked at another bimmer and -- sit down -- a top o the line hyundai. at that moment in htoyotaory, the hyundai lease was $299 per month. his decision hyundai and his thoughts are ""if possible"" to pay $299 per month ""forever"" and always have a new or nearly new car.sure you can (i did) argue that there is no comparison between a 550 and the hyundai. well, this guy, far as i can tell, could afford virtually anything without a second thought probably into the low 6-figures. but the depreciation was taking the fun out of owning, so he switched to leasing, then even that wasnt much fun anymore, especially when he swears he has given up ""oh so little"" to have that new hyundai; well, he has given up the high cost. i dunno, maybe its the hangover from the great recession, maybe its the phase of the moon -- or climate change. the prices keep going up, that much is certain.what also is happening is that few companies own airplanes either -- they rent them (and there is at least some argument that would justify buying a jet -- since they are practically rebuilt annually.)the glut of car, the economy and people feeling they dont want to drive yesterdays news seems to be pressing ""us"" to drive younger and younger car, despite their breath-taking drop in value.ill tell you how crazy this is, if you dont think cross shopping a 550 with a hyundai is crazy enough, my commercial banker neighbor went from a v12 mercedes full sized coupe to a hyundai (again, not for any lack of ability on his part to front the money.)maybe he just didnt want to be considered part of the 1%.hell its hot. :confuse: "
robr2,August 2012,"  the cpa managing partner says you must either lease a new car and resign yourself to permanent monthly payments or buy a car and keep it a minimum of 10-years (and the 10 year number is the break-even number.) really? not a very smart cpa imho unless he is looking at leasing from only a business perspective. i dont think very many private owners who cannot take advantage of business tax laws would agree with that.i always buy - always have. ive never been offered a lease deal that could be better for me than an outright purchase. now i used to have a co-worker who would always lease because he never wanted to be out of warranty. but he was a high mileage driver and instoyotaed on zero down, 20k miles per year and an extended warranty to 60k. at one time he leased a volkswagen for almost $500 a month. and he was fine with that. heck, he couldve financed the whole thing for maybe $40 a month more and owned it outright. "
robr2,August 2012," true, but all prices crept up. top line of ford ford (compact ""economy"") is over $28k (msrp), v6 version of ""midsize family"" honda/toyota/nissan goes deep into thirties - so why so suprised that the most expensive brand of ellps (or at least one of top 3) goes over $50k? i guess what i feel is that $50k for a 3 series isnt a great value. but value is a subjective measure where price is an objective measure.now i cant see why bmw doesnt produce the 3 series in spartanburg for north american consumption. if people are willing to fork over $50k for a 3, why not build it here and cut out the euro penalty? bmw could probably increase gross profit by 20%. "
fedlawman,August 2012," 10 years ago when this thread was started, the entry-level segment was defined by the e46 bmw, acura tl, audi audi, lexus is300, and the pontiac5. all of them started at or just below $30,000.of course, back then car still had cassette players and 0-60 in 7 secs was considered quick. this segment has probably seen the biggest gains in performance and technology over the last decade than any other segment.i suppose that a $10,000 average price hike over a ten year period is reasonable when considered logically, but emotionally it just seems like an invisible line was crossed. $40,000+ just seems like a lot of money to me for a group of relatively ubtoyotauitous car. "
flightnurse,August 2012,"  top line of ford ford (compact ""economy"") is over $28k (msrp) base on a nissanium 5 dr is $24.5k then add fluff.... btw, the top level ford is the hybrid with starts at $39k.the most expensive brand of ellps (or at least one of top 3) goes over $50k?but why, why not import a lower cost model, instead bmw, mb, audi will introduce smaller car to bring the price point down. i dont want a 4dr 1 series, i dont want a b class or audi sedan... but the truth is today it is hard to find something decent below forty grandnew or used? if new, and i know some people would disagree, but one can build a nice chryslerc for under 40k. as well as lexus is...yes, prices do go up, but there has to be a point when ""entry"" is no longer entry. is a nissan max an ellps? now i think infiniti got it right, but for some reason it never took off, offer he current g in a price point. the infiniti looks just like a infiniti, the leather might not be as nice, but the instrument panel, seat, body all look like the big brother, but the price is not. not too sure why it never caught on, a nice way to get into the ellps... "
fedlawman,August 2012," ""i dont want a 4dr 1 series, i dont want a b class or audi sedan""i do.the current bmw and audi are as big as the bmw and audi of a decade ago. a 4-door bmw or audi for $32,000 is exactly where this segment should be. "
flightnurse,August 2012, or maybe for the same price one can get a nice nissan max that is better.. i guess it all depends on what you want. 
ivan_99,August 2012," i think the price-creep is more a result of perspective than actual increase.this week i had the pleasure of purchasing football equipment (for 2 boys)...my younger boy found gloves he liked; ""but its only $50 dollars"".and then i proceeded...""in my day, $50 dollars could buy you..."" :shades: "
markcincinnati,August 2012," point well taken, but i will then ask, at what price point, these days are there not ""a group of relatively ubtoyotauitous car"" from which one may choose?$50,000? $60,000 even $70,000? it seems to me that even at the higher price points there are several offerings that, for many, only differ in styling -- and sometimes even then the styling isnt all that much of a differentiator.heres the thing that i noticed the last time i was visiting our bmw dealer -- there are bmw 7 series car that shoot way the hell past $100k, yet they are only slightly differentiated from the ""cheap ones.""there was a high zoot audi at the audi dealer, and there was also an s8 -- now, i wouldve taken the s8 (if i were just thinking about the car itself); but the audil w12 with a bunch of ""i cant believe the thing has a walk in cooler in the back seat"" type options, was way more expensive. then of course there was the cheapie plain ol audi swb version. they were all very, er, ubtoyotauitous.""now i used to think i was pretty astute at discerning what i was looking at -- but today i saw a new volkswagen sel that mustve had some optional glitzy wheels and a beige leather interior (i assume it was real cow, that is). i thought, for a full second, ""nice audi.""i doubt the volkswagen was more than $35k -- but it looked expensive (assuming you think audi look expensive.)nothing about a acura looks expensive to me -- but what the hell do i know, i bought a 2012 acura tl (not to imply i think the tl looks expensive, but from the outside it looks less like a honda than the acura.)what do i know?drive it like you live. :surprise: "
m6user,August 2012," no, the starting price on a bmw rwd 325 in 2003 was about $27k and the starting price of the 2013 bmw rwd 328 is about $36k. that is approx $9000 difference and would constitute creep as they say. "
ivan_99,August 2012, $27k in 2003 is $33.6k in 2012...still creeping a bit i suppose  
m6user,August 2012," yes, i would say so. $9k is about a 33% increase in price. a 2002 toyota toyota le was $19500. a 2012 toyota le is $23400. about a 20% increase. the 2003 audi audi audi was $27500 and the 2013 version is $33400, or about a 21% increase. if one could consider the toyota as a ""commodity"" and use that as a baseline, it would seem bmw ellps has creeped substantially more than both the baseline and one of its main competitors. and both the toyota and the audi increased below the percentage you used for inflation. "
sweendogy,August 2012," consumer reports. ""sports sedan with its inviting blend of luxury and driving fun, the infiniti stands out from the crowd. its chevrolet handling, bltoyotaering acceleration, and toyotaable, well-crafted interior make it one of our highest-scoring sedan and have earned the g a spot on this ltoyota for the sixth straight year. this sports sedan feels at home whether tackling a twtoyotay back road or cruising on the highway. a snug cabin and small trunk are the only notable weaknesses. the less expensive infiniti model isn&#146;t as quick, but it shares much of the infiniti&#146;s inviting package and provides 3 more mpg. both are available with rear- or all-wheel drive."" 6 years in a row, price hasnt move much - best car for thr money, and prob the new class of the class- $$ has to be a factor here "
fedlawman,August 2012," youre right mark, i hadnt really thought about that. i suppose its even worse up the ladder because the price gap between an ""entry-level"" 7-series and loaded 7-series is so huge... "
m6user,August 2012," ""the infiniti looks just like a infiniti, the leather might not be as nice, but the instrument panel, seat, body all look like the big brother, but the price is not. not too sure why it never caught on, a nice way to get into the ellps... ""the leather in the infiniti is the same leather as in the infiniti. the only difference between the two is the smaller engine and the unavailability of several options in the infiniti like no nav, etc. the reason it didnt sell imo is the same reasons i was disappointed in it.1. couldnt get nav or a few other bells and whtoyotales as options even.2. for 100 less horses, i believe people thought you should get a lot better mpg on regular gas too.3. it was only priced about $3000 less than the infiniti and they are always discounting the infiniti pretty heavy and wouldnt go down that far on the infiniti. net effect....they were too close in price for such a drastic difference in performance. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," wow, you guys have been quite chatty since i last checked in. im back in ct after driving 1700 miles through 10 states.i agree with you guys that acura has completely lost its way. the tl sh-awd is the exception here. the acura brakes stink. our government should mandate that bmw supply brakes to every car on the road. prices on these car have crept up over the years. as you all know, my 2011 328xi is leased (i know its more expensive to lease, but its going to be a damn fun 30 months). $50k for a 4 cyl 3 series is a big pill to swallow. like many of you have toyota, $50k is not entry level. in my book anyway. im quite certain that if i do want to continue to drive sedan in this category when the lease is up on my bmw in 2 years, im going to have to go the cpo route. otherwise ill have to look at a car that isnt so performance oriented to suite my commuting needs. "
plekto,August 2012," the thing with honda and toyota is that that have been trying to follow cadillac and mercedes. now, this isnt a *bad* thing. the c class is a superb car to get around town in in style without breaking the bank. gm makes superb big boats that float down the road and are kind on your old back.theres a reason the lexus es is called a ""japanese buick"". acura rightly figured that since it couldnt make a better car than the 3 series, they should just go where the money is - in big comfy car. fair enough. the tl is a very nice car inside and is great to just drive around town and get stuck in traffic in but toyota and honda are a lot like gm in that theres a hard division between sports and luxury, with only one or two vehicles that bridge that gap. (possibly the lexus is and the cts, honda has nothing any more since they dropped the acura) "
dino001,August 2012," i kind started it, but now i have to add one small contradiction to what was toyota: sure car went up 20-30% over ten years. this is much more than average wage increase (except perhaps the top earners, who seem to enjoy way better growth than rest of us). in those terms, car should not cost more than 10-15%. part of the rest could be explained by commodity inflation outpacing the wage inflation, especially in late 00s and even now it is not all gone (i just cant imagine how much box of corn flakes will cost next year). there was a huge dollar debasement in late 00s, somewhat recovering now, but its a fact (if anybody cares to remember, 1 euro was about 90 us cents in early 2000s). all of those things contributed to price increases, and german brands would probably have crept even more if not for economic downturn and loss of the marginal customer (one that puts your sales target over the guided targets).however, those car also offer more, much more for that money. more metal (not always a good thing, but at least in absolute terms - it is more), more features, better safety, better fuel economy with more power, etc. some was mandated (tire pressure monitors, traction control systems, gas mileage improvements), some was market-driven (consumer electronics, size). i know some people would actually prefer 2003 325i over 2012 bmw, but in all objective metrics, 2012 model is simply a better machine. same goes for the named toyota, audi and all the rest. if we factor those improvements, the prices are probably not as outrageously higher. the models tend to drift up in size and content over the years and create room for new line (bmw vs. 1-series), so after about three generations it is fair to start making those comparisons (both in term of price and content) with models from other shelf. i think in 10 years, ellps will include all those models dismissed today as ""not l enough"" or ""not p enough"" and current bmw/mercedes will be favorite ""family upscale sedan"". :surprise: "
robr2,August 2012," i agree about the reason for the price creep but i also see people adapting to that by lowering their standards when it comes to to their next car. to keep it simple, somebody who used to drive an honda honda will drop down to an ex and then perhaps to an chrysler in the course of a few years as their income hasnt kept up with the price of automobiles - or anything else as well.i know someone who in the course of 5 car and 15 years who has gone from a chrysler to mitsubishi with a gradual step down over the years in order to keep the payment in his toyota zone. "
flightnurse,August 2012," hey fed if you want to cross shop, the mb s class starts at 94k this is for the s350 diesel which is their entry level flagship. kinda steep but then again, mb sells every single s class they import. i just wasnt aware the s class had gotten up that high over the 7 series and audi. "
flightnurse,August 2012," 3. it was only priced about $3000 less than the infiniti and they are always discounting the infiniti pretty heavy and wouldnt go down that far on the infiniti. net effect....they were too close in price for such a drastic difference in performance.im thinking this is the real issue, i went over to the infiniti leasing questions forum, and was shocked at how much infiniti is discounting the car. also the odd length of the leases, 18 months? many people are getting leases on a infiniti 6 spd mt for just fees and $299/m other have been able to get a infiniti dodge + premium package, drive off are fees and $405/m (this is with tax) for 36 months. infiniti is giving some incredible buy rates to get these prices..one can see why the infiniti did not sell. but i did read that it will be coming back with a turbo 4, and more equipment for the same price. should be interesting. "
m6user,August 2012," after just a little research i found it interesting to note the following price increases over a ten year period for several base ellps.1. bmw - 33%2. audi - 21%3. mb - 14%quite a spread and dont know how it is explained by commodity prices and euro exchange rate as the latter would affect all the german makers somewhat equally. now, content could explain away some of the large difference in price creep but i believe all the makers have increased size and content to similar degrees. comparatively, and with the recent improvements in the c class it seems like that may be a value. if you like mb. "
shabadoo25,August 2012, the gs are ending their model cycle and im sure nissan wants to move them before the new ones are introduced. 
graphicguy,August 2012," is there a big gap between a $40k car vs a $50k car? i guess it depends on the car and the measuring stick. is it performance? quality of build and/or materials used? suspension sophtoyotaication? features?if you use the acura tl sh awd as the baseline at $40k, is it as good or better than a bmw bmw? an audi a/s4? probably not. i would say it trumps a mercedes c class 4 matic, though. it has better tech and suspension than a g.the 3 series is the measuring stick. if you get all the tech, with leather, nav, power, bmw, etc. youre going to pay $50k. as hard as it is for me to say, the s4 trumps the bmw bmw, too. so, to get that extra nth degree more of everything, you pay more.having driven the tl sh awd, the g and comparing them to the bmw and the s4, you can immediately see where the extra money went.its up to the individual with the check book to decide if its worth it. "
sweendogy,August 2012, i would also note the good resale - prob another reason they can offer a lease so cheap- bmw has been doing it for a while infact they might have invented leasing 
nyccarguy,August 2012," great point robsubaru. like i toyota above, $50k is a pill im not prepared to swallow when my lease is up in 2 years. ive been doing a little financial soul searching (mortgage, car payments, retirement, 3 kids to feed, clothe, & send through college). i lived with my honda as my dd for 9 years. its a great driving car, power everything, cloth (unheated) seat, ac, no navigation... yes i can afford an off lease $25k to $30k nicely equipped cpo ellps, but maybe i could also buy a honda fit (new, much cheaper) & pay it off in 3 years. that car & my wifes honda would be paid off around the same time & winds up being a huge chunk of money to put away every month. "
fedlawman,August 2012," well, in my book, a $38,000 bmw with leatherette seat and 17"" wheels is much easier to fathom than a $48,000 bmw with nav, leather, and all the other frills.$10,000 is a lot to spend on stuff that adds little to the driving/ownership experience and will probably break in 5 or 6 years. "
dino001,August 2012," the results are unverified, but assuming your research is right, it indeed is quite a spread, which flies into face of commodity inflation thesis. obviously speaks into strategies of those companies pursue. there can be some one-time factors in play, or some shifting in target markets. as i remember, mb used to be most expensive, audi least - it may be different now.bmw may also pursue somewhat different strategy in option vs base pricing. i noticed that the start from high kia, ridiculous prices at the beginning of the model life, but over time they tend to add things as no-cost or deeply discounted packages. for example, my 2012 wagon, last year of its line, had leather free already since 2011, there was additional discount on navigation with premium package ($500) and some of those phone acuration electronics (bluetooth) were rolled in as no cost, as well. on the other hand, mb pretty much held its mercedes options just the same for all that time. a friend of mine notices (he likes them much more than i) that mb-tex (vinyl surface) is actually dominant in stock, whereas almost no bmw have leatherette on dealers lots. i suspect mb did some creative content shuffling to hold the line on base. "
dino001,August 2012," well, in my book, a $38,000 bmw with leatherette seat and 17"" wheels is much easier to fathom than a $48,000 bmw with nav, leather, and all the other frills. funny, i exactly got the latter (a little less than $48k msrp, but not far) and would never consider the former. absolutely not point for me to get car like bmw with leatherette. when i look at car, i ignore strippers and their prices. if i cant afford good stuff, i cant afford the car. would rather buy loaded model of lower prominence than bottom of line something ""aspirational"". "
nyccarguy,August 2012," funny you say that about mb text. my best friends wife had an 09 e350 4matic. $60k car with mb text. the mb text was so good that my friend didnt even notice it until the temps started to heat up. he toyota his back would sweat on car rides longer than an hour. he called the sales manager that his family deals with & asked him about it. i think mb charged $2000 or $2500 for full leather seat. he toyota they order what they can w/ mb text because the majority of people would rather have the cheaper lease payment.our 2007 x3 had leatherette. i had no problem with it.the auto mfrs. definitely toy around with standard features. sunroofs were standard starting in 04 3 series. all of the sudden in (i think) in 2010 sunroof is a $1000 option or part of the premium package. back in 07, the panododgea sunroof was standard on my wifes x3, but an option on my dads x5.my 2011 has the no cost value package that gave me standard heated seat, leather, 17"" wheels, & an ipod/usb asap. my slushbox was a no cost option too.fedlawman - i agree with both your line of thinking as well as dino001s. my wifes former 2007 x3 had 4 options, steptronic (nc), montego blue metallic paint, heated front seat, bluetooth, & rear privacy glass & we loved it.my 2011 328xi has leather, navigation,metallic paint, premium package, xenon lights...id have to price a stripper out, but i still think it will be too rich for my blood. "
robr2,August 2012," ...there was additional discount on navigation with premium package ($500) and some of those phone acuration electronics (bluetooth) were rolled in as no cost, as well. imho, this comes from the falling cost of electronics as a whole. "
robr2,August 2012," id have to price a stripper out, but i still think it will be too rich for my blood.its $37,395 for a base bmw with leatherette and absolutely nothing else. 2.0, rwd, choice of manual or auto.i think the sales person at the dealership would scratch his head if you came in looking for that.one could:get the acura with leather standard and the $1k manual option and save $5korget the audi with leather and audi and save $4korget the c250 with auto and save $500or get the infiniti with auto and leather and save $3korget the is250 with auto and leather and save $1500.some folks might be happy with the base bmw setup as what i consider a drivers car and others may want a couple of other features and a few extra bucks in their pocket knowing they werent going to be driving 9/10ths anyway. "
dino001,August 2012," possibly, but the price went back up for 2012 sedan. they charge as much as they can, not as much as it costs. old model, you get discount here and there, new one you pay up. "
kyfdx,August 2012," our 03 bmw 325i sedan... with every option but nav, more or less...stickered for $38,500..i think a comparable 2012 model would be under $46k (of course, you get a turbo-4, instead of a 6-cylinder).. "
flightnurse,August 2012," if this was true, then the price of the options for the my 2012 would be the same price, but that wasnt the case.my bmw and all of the bmw for 2010 and 2011 came with the value package at no cost, leather (any color), ipod connector. this made the premium package costing $1750. i know for 2012 the wagon and coupes had no charge leather too. with the price of these car going up, some options should be standard. with the wagon, sunroof is standard. not too sure for 2013. "
andys120,August 2012," thanks to a nationwide promotion to support the us olympics team, yesterday i got a short drive in one of bmw&#146;s new f30 bmw car. the invite didn&#146;t specify which model but i figured all they&#146;d have would be bmw models (x-drive models aren&#146;t in showrooms yet) but i was given a choice and opted for the bmw (nearest equivalent to the &#146;01 bmw i own.).the car i got was a melbourne red bmw sport line four-door with the 8-speed autobox and a black leather interior. the car didn&#146;t have a monroney sticker and i didn&#146;t ask the price but i figure it should sticker around $50k.except for the color, i thought it was a really good-looking bmw. although the hood has an odd shape in some photograph it looks fine in the metal. the current bmw reds lack the vibrancy of the old imola red and the black made the inside a bit dour imo. i thought the othe car on hand in gray or blue were more attractive. the interior was quite roomy for a bmw, pretty close to the size of my e39 five series.i thought the interior styling was too cluttered and i was a bit taken aback by the many options you had to sort thru for suspension, transmission and other settings. it would take at least a couple of weeks to learn all the settings and controls on this car.the prescribed test route was a short 8 mile circuit on some of the best maintained tertiary two-lanes in the nh seacoast which is to say it wasn&#146;t much of a test of ride qualities but from what i could tell the car rode very smoothly, giving no hint of being on all-season run-flat tires of very low profiles. there&#146;s been a lot of concern about the lack of feel from the steering in the new (f10) fivers. i&#146;m happy to report that the steering on the bmw is just as communicative as you would expect on a bimmer. the transmission can be manually shifted readily and is well suited to a fast drive on back roads. brakes and handling were excellent and the stop-start system was almost invisible. you can fell the restart but there&#146;s no unpleasant bump or shudder.overall i think the f30 is an excellent all-round car that should be a very hard target for cadillac, audi or anyone else to surpass. i certainly would shop it but i do have some reservations. i&#146;ve never driven any car rated at 300hp but i assumed if i did it would be scary-fast. don&#146;t get me wrong, the turbo-bimmer is a fast car and will cover ground in a huge hurry but my old 5 liter ford (200hp) felt faster when you dropped the hammer to take off from a standstill but then the &#145;stang was very light and had no traction control.i also thought the &#146;013 bmw lacks the &#147;whee&#148; factor of my e46 cahonda, it handles very well but just feels heavier and less tossable and less grippy than the old e46. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," robsubaru - i just priced out a 2013 f30 328xi sedan and kept the options to a minimum (standard paint, leatherette, no sunroof). lighting package, hk stereo, & heated front seat. msrp is $41,670. i know it could be ordered if thats what i really want. what bmw brings to the table as far as the base model goes does impress me. theres also a part of me that thinks like dino001 and says: ""you really want a $42,000 bmw with so little options.""i had a acura, liked it, ditched it after 2 1/2 years for my 2011 328xi. acura version of electric power steering wasnt for me.the audi is a really nice vehicle, but audi/volkswagen long term durability scares me.the c250 seems like a nice car too. i havent driven one, but right now mb only sells 4matic c300s with a lackluster v6 instead of the cool, new turbo 4.if i were to go with a g, itd be ""go big or go home"" infiniti. xenon lights arent available on the infiniti either. i havent read positive things about nissan small v6 as far as performance goes.i drove an is250 awd when it 1st came out in 2006. it had absolutely zero pickup. the 4cyl in my former acura felt better by the seat of my pants. "
robr2,August 2012," well my comparison was of ""entry level"" performance sedan. the $41k you priced out shows how the bmw is priced further into the strhyundaiphere.now everything you ltoyotaed as cons on all the vehicles are totally subjective things.imho, the $36k for the 325i without the things you mentioned in my eyes just isnt a value. i mean $36k for leatherette, no fancy electronics, not heated seat, no premium pack just doesnt work for me.if anything, id probably go for the audi with leather and audi and put some of the saved $4k into better tires and suspension. im not afraid of audi reliability as ive had a great experience with my volkswagen.besides you would probably lease - long term reliability shouldnt be a concern. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," i leased my 2011 328xi & while i love it, im going to buy (finance) my next purchase. "
habitat1,August 2012," ive been out of the car market (and off these forums) for a couple of years, but our recent decision to replace my wifes suv brought me back. when we went to look at the acura, the acura dealer, seeing us arrive in my 2004 tl 6-speed, asked me if i wanted to test drive a new 2012 tl awd 6-speed manual. i know all about bmw vs. acura relative to driving toyotamics and feel. (as evidence, we are paying $16k more for an x5d than the acura would have cost). however, if budget was an issue and i was lamenting ellps creeping towards and above the $50k price point, the current deals on the acura tls would be compelling to me.the dealer (pohanka in va) is currently offering $9,000 off on a tl-awd tech for a net price of $34,900. was the tl as satisfying to drive as the rwd bmw coupe that i drove when we were x5d shopping?? no, but i suspect it would be just as satisfying, if not more so than a 2013 bmw. and the price is compelling - a mere $25k less than bmw sticker as a side note, i referred a buddy to a bmw dealer in baltimore that had a brand new 2011 bmw 6-speed manual on their lot for 12 months. sport package and lots of other options put the sticker at $59,000+. i told him to hand he dealer a check for $45,000 and dare him to rip it up. he got it for $45,500. "
habitat1,August 2012," interesting to see your 10 year price comparisons showing 14%, 21% and 33% increases for mb, audi and bmw respectively. i happen to have an old kelly blue book that i pull out occasionally as a reminder of how crazy things were in the ""old days"". here are some base price stats that show what the decade from 1985 to 1995 looked like by comparison:1985 mercedes 190e - $23,7301995 mercedes c220 - $32,000increase = 34.9%1985 bmw 325e - $21,700.1995 bmw 325i - $34,120.increase = 57.2%1985 nissan nissan se - $13,6991995 nissan nissan se - $22,989increase = 67.8%1985 honda honda chrysler - $10,8241995 honda honda chrysler - $18,880increase = 74.4%1985 porsche 911 coupe - $31,9501995 porsche 911 coupe - $63,055increase 97.4%a few takeaways from this analysis:(1) its pretty amazing how modestly prices have gone up in the 17 years since 1995. if they had continued to climb at the 1985-1995 pace, a bmw bmw would now have a base price of $73,600 and a 911 coupe would be a mere $200,400. (2) back in the ""old days"", even a bottom of the line bmw or mercedes was a relatively rare symbol of status, costing over twice as much as a honda honda or 70% more than a ellps nissan. when i bought a 1995 nissan se, the 325i was over 50% more. today, the base price of a bmw is only $5,000 more than the base price of a 325i 17 years ago. and only a similar amount more than a nissan.draw your own conclusions as to what this means relative to ellps today. frankly, i think a lot of people today are stretching to get themselves into a bmw, audi or mercedes when, back in 1985, or even 1995, they would have not even considered it and had to ""settle"" for a honda honda or maybe nissan nissan. im not so sure that was a bad thing. "
dino001,August 2012," i think your little study (thanks for it, btw - informative). only makes me wonder if cheaper car (subcompacts went up even more). i blame our government that knows better whats good for the people (airbags, stability control, abs, emissions, fuel economy, the ltoyota goes on). as always defenders of the people end up hurting them much more - they always throw in arguments that it is only ""a little more"", but over time it those very people who pay for it through their noses. it seems that it is bottom car prices that came closer to luxury car - as they were galloping up, the luxury car were dritoyotaling, as those mandatory features were there anyway and smaller price differential created more incentive for people to reach, even if stretched. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," hey habitat1. good to see you back on the forum here. saw on another thread that you no longer have your beloved 911 c2 cab. my automotive condolences to you. ive never driven a tl sh-awd, but know its got some chops from what ive read. whatd you think of the brakes compared to the bmw? i dont track or race my car, just looking for a little fun on my 6 day/week commute like i did with my 2001 honda type sh for the 1st 9 years of its life. i wasnt ""getting it"" from the 2010 acura i inherited from my wife (lifeless electric power steering, crummy brakes). i love my 2011 328xi. i just dont know if the new f30 328xi will be worth it so sparsely equipped as i ""built"" last night. especially when a tl sh-awd tech comes loaded for a similar sticker. ive still got 2 years of research to decide about my next purchase. "
habitat1,August 2012," you make a good point. adding incremental costs for safety requirements will increase the cost of lower price car by a higher percentage than expensive car. but i still think the biggest difference over the past 2-3 decades in what we now label the elpps segment is that bmw and mercedes are now considered ""affordable"" by a much larger percentage of the population because of their conscious decision to employ a product mix and pricing strategy that competes for this market. perhaps partly in response or retaliation for lexus, infiniti and acura moving into their previously unchallenged luxury territory.anecdotal example: back in about 1969, i had a friend whose aunt drove a new mercedes. she would pick us up from grade school 2-3 days a week. people used to stop and stare at the car - and be even more shocked when they saw a woman driving it. at one point, she was interviewed by the local newspaper and asked how it felt to be the only verified single female that owned a mercedes in a honda of 100,000. she worked for navy intelligence, spent a lot of time in europe and got the mercedes through a diplomatic/military purchase progdodge at a huge discount, or so she toyota. today, id make a bet that if i drove 15 miles to the nearest wal mart, id find at least a dozen mercedes and bmw in the lot. hell, i think you can buy a mercedes at costco. "
habitat1,August 2012," thanks, but no condolences needed. i had a good 5 1/2 years and 30k miles with the 911 and my daughters couldnt fit in the back seat anymore. but if the bank account recovers in time from our upcoming x5 diesel purchase, i could possibly see a new cayman in my garage sometime next spring.regarding the tl vs. bmw, my own 2004 tl 6-speed has brembo brakes standard. i believe the 2012 tl sh-awd 6-speed manual does as well. in my car, they are great, and way, way better than the crappy brakes on our acura or the automatic tls i was given as service loaners. my 2004 is fwd, so it has all of those performance pitfalls, but is still a reasonably fun car.i would never seriously consider or recommend an automatic or fwd tl over a bmw. the 6-speed manual tl-shawd might be worth a test drive for you to make the call yourself. interestingly, i was not very favorably impressed with 2011/2012 bmw 6-speed manuals. i wasnt seriously in the market, but when we were shopping for the x5, was being tempted by some great deals. but after a few test drives, i concluded that the new 5 series felt heavy and a bit dull compared to the older models or the (outgoing) 3 series. "
m6user,August 2012," the general inflation rate will of course affect any price increases in addition to governmental regualtions. i believe the period you mentioned, 1985 to 1995 has substantially more inflation than the period i tracked, 2002/3 to 2012/13.mortgage rates were in the 9-10% range back in the late eighties. i remember refinancing in 1992 to 7.5%, down from 9.5%. if you consider the ""hyper"" inflation of the late 70s and early 80s(i can actually remember getting pay raises of over 10% several of those years) car prices may have been catching up somewhat. i believe they lag inflation by a couple of years as manufactures try to hold the line on prices until profit pressures become too great to restoyota. "
dino001,August 2012," this is good story. however, in 1969 mercedes was only making car that were market positioned equivalent of todays mercedes and top of mercedes. model 190 (predecessor of mercedes) was introduces somewhere in late 70s or early 80s, dont know exact dates. the ellps simply did not extoyota back then. there was a small bmw and europe has always had car like those, but the concept was pretty much unknown in the us. so the bridge was gapped from both sides (cheap car becoming not so cheap and expensive brands introducing less expensive models) "
habitat1,August 2012," you are exactly right - and thats the essence of my point. an ellps segment that has bmw and mercedes competing against japanese and even american car for the same buyer didnt really extoyota until about 1995 or later. prior to that, it was easy. we all knew our place in car society. and now hyundai is on tv with ads comparing their hyundai to a panamera s?? holy cow. "
ivan_99,August 2012," so with these numbers...its actually cheaper now.inflation is the killer...$38,500 in 2003 is $48,000 nowif you use any online inflation calculators you can see similar results:http://www.coinnews.net/tools/cpi-inflation-calculator/http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm/you cant print over a trillion dollars without getting hit with inflation...

flightnurse,August 2012, the 190e came state side in 1985. i remember in 1993 looking at the e320 convertible and thinking 80k is a lot of money.... today you can get a e350 convertible for the came amount of money.today an entry level c250 sedan is 35k (base) and will balloon to 43k with a couple of options. my 1987 e190 2.3-16 sportline was $36k new. just interesting to see how some car have faired priced wise over the years.

habitat1,August 2012," hey billy,great to hear from you and i bet you are still as fetoyotay as ever! werent we going to meet up on some deserted road and have a showdown between your tl-s and my old nissan se 5-speed?? so is your tl sh-awd a stick or an automatic? if its the latter we can start a new round of digital drag racing with my 2004 tl 6-speed manual. with only 62k miles in 8 years, im probably going to keep it for awhile longer and see if i cant sneak another porsche into my garage next spring.

habitat1,August 2012," how about trading in for a new wife?? just kidding. dont report me to ""nyccarwife"" for that bad joke. i had a bit of the opposite problem with my wife. we were trying to decide between another acura and x5d to replace her acura and then went to a porsche dealer that had a 2012 cayenne 6-speed manual in stock. gorgeous black on black with all the right options and none of the dumb ones. was willing to discount it to under $50k. my wife drove it and i almost had to pry her out with a crowbar. she was rowing those gears like it was a (slow) 911. but it was just a bit too small and i really didnt want to pay porsche service costs for a vehicle that will likely be keeping for 8+ years and 120k+ miles. we ordered an x5d.

nyccarguy,August 2012," lol @ trading in my wife! she has no desire to drive a stick (she has in the past on a few occasions). so as the old saying goes: ""nobodys perfect.""i was going to ask you if you drove a cayenne coming off of your 5 1/2 year live affair with your 911 cab. after an 05 530i & an 08 328xi, i was almost certain my mom was going to go for an x5. she drove the x5 & liked it a lot, but then drove a cayenne & fell in love. you definitely made the smart choice going with the x5 diesel. theres a lot to be toyota for bmw no cost maintenance. every time i spend a significant amount of time driving my wifes 2011 honda, i tell myself that its toyotaable & has adequate power. i drive my honda and enjoy the car simplihonda. i say to myself that i dont need a bmw (or bmw payment) as my commuter sled. then i push my 328xis start button and ltoyotaen to the i6 purr to life. i love how the engines power doesnt seem to peak, the perfectly weighted steering, the car agility & balance, how it seems to cruise effortlessly at high speeds...

nyccarguy,August 2012, my name is bradd & im addicted to bmw;) 
habitat1,August 2012," interesting review by c-net and seems to confirm my sense that bmw may be losing its way with the new bmw.my sense is that the new 3, being a little bigger, a little softer and a little more expensive, is creeping more and more into the ""tweener"" role that the bmw used to play between the enthusiast 3 and executive 7. especially when i look at dealers websites and see almost nothing but automatic transmissions. at the present time, the largest acura dealer in my area has 3 tl 6-speed manuals in stock and the largest bmw dealer has 0 (thats zero) bmw with a stick in stock. whats next, cats sleeping with dogs??even the c-net reviewer slipped into a bit of bipolarism when he longed for a manual transmission to better match the great engine, yet commented that a $50k+ car shouldnt have as much road noise and feedback.it appears that the 135i is now bmw enthusiast car. i was initially shocked when a volkswagening buddy showed up to our last outing this june driving a new 135i convertible. it was his ""graduation present"" for getting his last kid through college. i asked how he fit into that little ""toy"". he quickly pointed out that it has the same front seat interior room as his old 1987 bmw, is considerably faster and better handling, and cost about the same amount.....25 years later. not that price mattered - he owns/flys his own turboprop - but he bought the 135 for its virtues, which sounded a lot like why people used to buy the 3 series: driving enjoyment. so is the bmw gradually evolving into less of the driving enthusiasts choice and more of a ""mini-5""? "
nyccarguy,August 2012," habitat - i felt the same way when i drove an f10 bmw & 550i. very nice car. fast (bmw) & officer, there is no way i was going 130 mph (550i). even with settings on ""sport plus,"" the car handling & road feel still felt isolated.same thing when i drove a 650i convertible. very pretty & incredibly fast, but for $100k i wasnt blown away. ill take a 911 c2 coupe for that kind of cash.

"
fedlawman,August 2012," i think everything evolves in cycles. for a while (2004 through 2006), acura was arguably #2 in this segment under bmw. audi was overshadowed by bmw, infiniti was showing promise as a japanese bmw alternative, and m-b wasnt an enthusiasts choice. cadillac was showing promise and lexus was failing as a japanese bmw alternative.today, audi is tops and infiniti is arguable #2 being the best bang-for-the-buck choice in the segment. bmw and acura have both lost their way (though the roundel still has clout the car dont deserve right now). mercedes has improved quality and handling toyotamics, and cadillac has gained credibility with the gen2 cts (and the ats is looking like a real player). lexus remains content to do the same old thing and sell a ton of es and rx 350s.6 years from now, im sure the picture will be completely different again.

flightnurse,August 2012," bradd the 6 series is not really a sports car, it is really a grand touring, which is not a bad thing really.the new 5 series is ok, as i stated, if i was to get a 5 series it would be a 550i with the m sport package, which really makes it a bmw light. yes, driving one is a lesson in control, as it is easy to drive it fast without knowing it.the 1 series will become the 2 series starting in 2014 and bmw will be bring out a series of car sort of like the audi ""s"" car, i have read that in 2014 the 235i will have a m performance package, sort of like what bmw did with the 3 series with the zhp package. this is why it is hard for me to get sell my 330i, it was/is a true drivers car, something that the current 3 series is not. the m235i will get the 315hp turbo six, which would make me want to sell my 330i, it will be a drivers car. this is something that infiniti hasnt done with the g, its not a drivers car. the m235i will be less then what i paid for my 330i and give me more performance, so it is a win win... "
flightnurse,August 2012," bill you looking at a new 550 or used ? the current 550i is by far the best 5 series one can by, the single turbo 6 in the 535 doesnt have the feel that the twin turbo 6 had, doesnt feel as sporty. the 550 is a fright train, i would take the 550 over the bmw any day. "
habitat1,August 2012," fedlawman - whats your basis for saying audi is #1 and infiniti is #2 in this segment?audi makes some very nice car, but for all of the accolades the audi gets, i dont think of it as an enthusiasts choice. no manual transmission, very heavy, an awd system that is fwd biased, etc. it performs quite well, in spite of all of that, but i still cant think of it as a true drivers car. and in the performance line of the s4, s5, s6 car, i would still never put them in the enthusiasts league of the bmw or bmw. more like amg-lite.if you are saying that audi is #1 because they are the closest to ""all things for all people"", id probably agree. but they dont get my own blood boiling to dump my acura tl and buy one tomorrow. on another matter, i think bmw needs to steal some porsche engineers and put their vehicles on a big diet. the 550i weighs damn near the same as a porsche cayenne suv. which, by the way, dropped 400 lbs in its redesign and the new 911 and boxster have also lost a few pounds in the porsche spa. not sure why bmw, ""the ultimate driving machine"" has been so slow to use more aluminum and charge its engineers to do more with less (weight).

"
markcincinnati,August 2012," the audi audi audi on day one was not fwd biased. it was a 50% 50% set up with a non-reactionary torsen system. torque was able to be shifted instantly f or r -ward based on circumstances. the non-reactionary system was untoyotaue (probably still is since most of the market doesnt use torsen) since it was toyota to ""act in real time."" all other systems ""react"" which means there is a slight delay in the transfer of power to the end where it will do the most good.for years the audi audi audi has been rear wheel biased, but still uses a non-reactionary system. the tt, on the other hand, did not start out with the torsen system, rather it started out with the halsubaru system (not that there is anything wrong with that), but it is fwd biased and it is a reactionary system, meaning there is some lag whilst the thing figures out there is a need for power at the opposite end and then shifts power appropriately.the audi, since that is where we started, also can be equipped with a system that is called the sport differential, but you can call it a torque vectoring system and youd be right. acura system is sh-awd but it is, currently, implemented in its car with severe fwd bias (95%), and it, too, is reactionary. those of you who have the 6-speed auto 305hp v6 tl sh-awd can attest to the lag time in these reactionary systems by simply putting the transmission in drive and flooring the accelerator. for an instant (which seems like a second) the steering wheel twitches in your grip while the reaction time passes and the fwd power is shifted aft.try an audi s4 or even an audi -- both, like the audi, with rear biased awd -- floor them -- there is zero torque steer, since the thing is 60% rwd biased and doesnt have to react, since torsen differentials ""bind in real time.""the new audi audi chassis, while still nose heavy, are much better with respect to weight dtoyotaribution than they have ever been and somehow audi has -- perhaps only for a brief 15 minutes of fame, so to speak -- managed to jump to the top of the heap insofar as performance is concerned. and, despite its high price tag, the new s6 is a price performer when compared to both bmw and mercedes models that can keep up with it. yep, audi have cranked up their prices -- but, if there is such a thing as bang for the buck in the over $60,000 crowd, today that accolade would be earned only by audi.i still remember my buddy who purchased a new 530 (rwd only) with a premium pack option, period. this was, admittedly 2002. my audi audi was a audi with the sport package, premium wheels, nav and everything you could get on an audi, including premium paint -- oh yea, and it came with a 4.2l v8. my audi was about $2k less. to even approximate the content (but not the engine) would have put the 530s msrp into orbit.where was i? oh, yea -- audi audi have never been fwd biased, and for several years now they have been rwd biased, but with non-reactionary awd (which, admittedly, makes them a bit heavier than the other ellps and lps offerings from asia, europe and the us.) :p "

"
habitat1,August 2012," i respect your opinion, but not sure i would agree with it. the audi, as with the tl, requires that you go with awd to avoid their standard fwd setup. thats ok if you are comparing to a bmw, but if the ""p"" in ellps is important, i still prefer the driving feel and toyotamics of a 50/50 balanced rwd sedan. and, if you really want awd and can get by the exterior looks of the tl, it appears to offer significantly better performance than the audi audi. personally, i dont find audi exterior design on the audi to be that much better than the tl. the audi is seriously great looking, the audi very good, but the audi/audi still look slab sided and plain/boxy in my opinion. when i think ""sexy"", the audi qualifies, but the audi needs a lot of work. even the mercedes sedan beat the audi for exterior looks, imo.disclosure: i havent driven a new audi audi 6-speed manual. i am basing performance comparison on what is published and my limited experience with an automatic as a loaner. but giving up nearly 100hp to the tl and acura awd system (perhaps) being more advanced from a handling perspective, leads me to believe that the audi would not do well in a track test between the two. and maybe not against a bmw rwd. but.....sexy is an ""o"", so i do respect your ""imo"".

fedlawman,August 2012," i agree the tl has the better powertrain, but a infiniti costs $44k, and for that much money, there are better choices imo (s4?).and the interior and exterior styling of the audi is far better (again imo). better control layout and material quality in the audi, and the audi just goes down the road better (quieter cabin with classic german suspension tuning). its the only $35k car here that makes you feel like you spent $45k when youre driving it.the awd tl is the best car acura sells right now and i agree its still a contender (i like it better than the infiniti). but i have to bump acura down a notch from 6 years ago because as a whole, their lineup isnt very compelling. "
flightnurse,August 2012," in regards to the 550i, yes it is heavy, however, the 550i still does 0-60 in 5 sec, pretty darn quick for a heavy sedan, and with m sport package handles very well too. much better then mb e550 (which one comes in all wheel drive.) "
flightnurse,August 2012," not in my book, three turbos, talk about one hot engine compartment. i read that bmw was looking to bring over a v8 twin turbo oiler that made the same amount of power, which was faster and better mph. heck, i would be happy if they just dropped the x5 oiler in the 5 series and turned up the boost some. "
flightnurse,August 2012," nyc, just because it has a sport package doesnt make it is a sports car. just as the mb sl doesnt live up to its name, sl means ""superleicht"" super light, however we all know that over the years that wasnt true for that model. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," i know its a big, grand touring, coupe & that sport pkg doesnt equal sports car. i expected a hint of sharpness, but it was more isolated than i expected.true about the sl. "
habitat1,August 2012," in my area, the ""real world"" price on a 2012 audi and tl infiniti would be within a few dollars. an audi with navigation and premium package is $41k, invoice $38.2k. add $2,500+/- to those numbers if you go with a prestige package. the tl infiniti is can be bought for about $35-36k ($8-9k off msrp) right now, from pohanka acura, with 3 in stock. so, if anything, a comparably equipped audi audi might be a little more expensive than the tl. prices may vary where you are at. aesthetic preferences are very subjective, and i respect yours. if the audi had more of the look of the audi, id be more excited. not sure how they would do that - maybe reshape it into an audi-lite and flair the sides a bit. as for going down the road better, ill hold off on that until if and when i get behind the wheel. the 2010+/- audi automatic i had as a service loaner was certainly not as you describe in quietness and luxury feel, but that was a couple of years ago and it may have been beaten up a bit. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," thanks for the vote of confidence. yeah, they do grow up insanely fast. cant believe my oldest will be 6 & going into 1st grade in a few weeks.features vs. mojojust curious as to how many of you would take the ellps with the smaller engine & more features vs. the car that would have you fighting to keep it below triple digits on public roads (if the costs were in the same ballpark) daily driver of course? "
fedlawman,August 2012," i respect your opinions as much as anyone here and i admit your points about the tl are valid. street pricing vs. msrp, while a legitimate point, always complicates the discussion so i tend to avoid bringing it up.and yes, the audi styling pales in comparison to the audi, which is drop dead gorgeous, but it appears to me as the most fluid and least contrived of the segment. of course, theres just so much you can do with a 4-door 3-box design without sacrificing interior space/toyota.i admit its been a while since ive driven the tl, so maybe i need to refresh my memory? i remember it being a very nice car, but like all honda, a little less isolated in cabin noise vs. the competition. "
habitat1,August 2012," i am a bmw fan, as evidenced by our imminent pick up of an x5d in early september at the performance delivery center in spartanburg. and the 550i is a very nice car in many respects. but it could - and should - be better yet.the 550i infiniti weighs 4,350+ lbs, goes 0-60 in about 5.0 and gets 15/22 mpg. the cls550 is 200 lbs lighter, goes 0-60 in 4.4 and is rated 17/25 mpg. the e55 awd is another 115 lbs less than the cls.when i was vaguely contemplating an bmw in 2002, it weighed 4,000 lbs and with a high revving 400hp/369 ft.lb engine, was a few tenths quicker than the current 550i in spite of giving up 80 ft lbs of torque. forget the handling comparison, the old bmw was much more precise, nimble and tossable than the current 550. in the ellps, we have seen pretty steady improvements in performance, at not a huge increase in price. i would expect bmw to have maintained its dominance with the 550i, but in my opinion, has been slow to put it on a diet and keep it positioned as the clear enthusiasts choice over some of the lps competition. at least they do still offer a 6-speed manual. and maybe the added 40 hp in the performance package for 2013 will help. but id like to see it tip the scales at 3,950. thats still a half ton more than my beloved 1995 nissan and only 400 lbs less than a cayenne suv. come on, bmw, start doing those push ups and get rid of the flab. "
flightnurse,August 2012," when you say sharpness, explain. _i_ feel that the people might expect more out of the 6 series then what bmw was intending the 6 series to be. now i can tell you the 1st gen 6 series had more sporty feel then the current one. havent driven the 4 dr 6 series yet, which im thinking wont be all that sporty but still competent when pushed, more so then the mb sl. "
flightnurse,August 2012,"  i remember it being a very nice car, but like all honda, a little less isolated in cabin noise vs. the competition.hey fed, for me most  honda products are like appliances, they do what they are suppose to and dont leave a last impression. on my last trip arrived into charotte nc late, got to rental car agency and had a problem, not many car to choose from, had a couple of chrysler (no thanks), 2 nissan, a toyota and an honda. i had my choice of chevrolet or transverse. i took the honda (its been a while since i have driven one) it was an ex. nothing stood out for me, the driving position, the steering feel, the brakes, the handling. when one talks about the tl, i hear people talk about the top of the line model, not the entry level or mid level. the last time i drove a tl was back in 2008 and it was a type s, nice car, very toyotaable seat, but again, not else stood out. "
stickguy,August 2012," i would go with features. i rarely would get to use any of the extra performance, and after driving relatively small engine car, even a small motor (say, the infiniti infiniti) is going to be fast!so i would give up some motor (your car vs. a 335 say) to get the goodies like moonroof, fancier seat, etx. "
markcincinnati,August 2012," while i agree that for the price of a tl sh-awd advance you could get a base audi s4, the s4 requires over $11,000 of options to get to parity with respect to ""content."" the tl sh-awd advance with the a la carte addition of back-up sensors and suzuki gaurds is north of $47 or $48k depending on how many a la carte do-dads (which are nice) you check off.the tl sh-awd, however, is able to (mostly) keep up with the s4 (youve no doubt read the test report comparing the two car, which shows them to have remarkably similar performance -- even though the audi, in the end, does out-perform the acura -- for $11,000+ more outlay.)i call the tl sh-awd advance, an s4 ""lite"" or perhaps s4-like. given a price independant choice, i would still, however, take the s4 without any hesitation. i like the [acura] 19"" wheels, blind spot warning, the ventilated seat, the best factory sound system ever and the torque vectoring, etc, etc, etc, all of which jack the cost of an s4 way too close to $60,000.i went to acura from a nearly $49k 2009 audi audi 2.0t prestige audi sport -- the last in a long, long line of audi products (which i dearly loved.) i wanted the performance of the audi and the content of the acura -- for under $50k. the acura is outgunned by the s4 (and yet the tl is not shamed by the s4), but [the tl sh-awd advance] is priced like an audi audi premium+ with a couple of options on it. and the acura is ""similar"" in performance to the s4, which i would argue is at the top o the heap of the desirable car ltoyota (that can be afforded by mere mortals.) the tl is ugly, a step up from fugly, but a far cry from the beautiful audi (imho). but once youre behind the wheel of the tl at, ahem, ""highway"" speeds  ltoyotaening to a great dvd-audio disk, you quickly forget how the face and butt of the tl look.today, the tl remains an interesting proposition -- perhaps when acura ""rationalizes"" the entire lineup, improves the styling and so forth, acura will regain legitimacy in the premium class. i await 2014 for some sign from above that they have once again found their way.my hopes are high, but likewise are my doubts that they [acura] will once again be a legitimate player in the ellps and lps sandbox. the new acura and acura indicate they think they can get away with producing ""honda who know someone"" rather than real premium car. and, you know what? if they sell enough of them, it doesnt matter one whit what any of us thinks. with acura were kind of at the same place we were (or are) with respect to manual transmissions -- no matter how we cry and whine (here on these boards), manual transmissions are virtually dead because ""no one"" buys them and it costs a lot to get a car certified for sale here in the us -- so why bother when the customer take up on stick shifts which used to be at 3% continues to fall and fall and fall into the abyss. we have voted with our dollars -- and here we are. :surprise: drive it like you live. "
markcincinnati,August 2012," oh, almost forgot. i drove a tl in the $35k price range -- it was almost as bad as a lexus es (a barco lounger on wheels). the tl that truly feels like an ellps is the tl sh-awd advance (by a moderate margin, id toyota.)even the tech version seems tinny, flimsy and not worthy -- of anything but the comment, ""nice honda."" :confuse: the top of the line must have some secret sauce, a ""sport tuned"" suspension perhaps(?) -- i had never driven any tl other than a tl sh-awd advance until 2 weeks ago. what a disappointment to drive the lesser vehicle. it wallowed (like a pig) and seemed to be soft and squishy, able to overpower its poor tires and wheels even on a clovernissan exit dodgep. damn near made me say ""who screwed up this car, is this a joke?""

"
habitat1,August 2012," im not sure what to make of your tl awd ""advance"" accolades. all the ""advance"" is, is a tech with a few extra gadgets. period. no chassis, brakes or other mechanical differences whatsoever. the advance comes standard with 19"" ""all season"" performance tires, whereas the tl infiniti can be ordered with either all season or summer performance tires. none of which are as good as you can do from tire rack when you replace them. my 2004 tl infiniti had a number of addiitonal performance features that none of the automatic models offered at the time: brembo brakes, larger diameter stabilizer bars, ""sport tuned"" suspension, summer w-rated performance tires. but for the current 2012 model, acura bagged the brembo brakes completely (bad move) and made the suspensions equal across all awd models regardless of base, tech, advance or infiniti. what the tl sh-awd infiniti offers is arguably one of the better close ratio short throw six speeds to be found in an ellps and a not insignificant 110 - 145 pound weight savings over the tech and advance automatics. to me, the driving difference between a infiniti and any of the automatic tls is significant - with much more responsive acceleration and fun to drive factor. if you found there to be a difference between driving a tech and an advance in automatic form, i cant imagine where its coming from. possibly those ventilated seat, but not the engine, suspension, brakes or anything else that matters. "
fedlawman,August 2012," i agree the tl sh-awd is a terrific car, and with discounts is also a good buy. my comments about acura really sum up my overall disappointment with the downward spiral of their entire lineup.in 2004 they had the acura which, while arguably not deserving of the acura badge, was a terrific sports car (especially in ""s"" trim). then there was the first gen acura infiniti. its ride, handling styling, driveline, etc. had such a synergy that, for me, made it an even match for the bmw bmw. and the tl in 2004 was lean and mean, with good looks, powerful driveline, and sharp reflexes.today, the only acura worth a second glance is the tl sh-awd. and even their best has polarizing looks (im being polite  ) and an unattractive cockpit with too many buttons (my opinion).for me, even with a bottom-of-the-line audi, you get a handsome, elegant sedan that does no wrong. now ill admit that im not a bells and whtoyotales kind of guy, so i dont care if my car has back up cameras, nav, and surround audio. hell, i even prefer cloth and pleather to genuine cowhide!oh well, im just one enthusiast with admittedly unconventional tastes. and ive admitted before that i became alienated from this segment several years ago when i discovered the joys of e30s.thank you and habitat for setting the record straight on the sh-awd - i did do it a disservice by not mentioning it in my initial comment. "
mcdawgg,August 2012," ""2010 stats- odds of a toyota being sold with a manual 1237 to one, total car sold 325k in the states. subarus 1300 to one they sold 93k in the states acura tl 6305 to one ""i have one of those 2010 toyota 6 speed manuals. love it. people say toyota are boring, but the 6 speed manual makes it better than any automatic, cvt, whatever, in my opinion. "
habitat1,August 2012," acura tl 6305 to one where in the world did this stat come from? had they discontinued the infiniti in 2010? (i wasnt in market and dont know).in any event, there are 3 tl manuals sitting on pohanka acura lot right now, and they have sold at least 10-12 so far this year. that kind of blows the 1 in 6305 out of the water for 2012. ive been told that manual transmissions on the tl this year are running about 3%, which would make it 33 to 1. or 190 to 6305.it is a shame in my opinion. the tl manual gets an 8.5 out of 10 on my scale for crisp feel, short throw. behind my s2000 (rate 9) and 911s (rate 10), but ahead of all non-m bmw, all audi, and the infiniti. just rating the gearbox, mind you, not the car. on the other hand, the tl (and acura) automatic gets a 3 on my rating scale. way too much lag time and mushiness in response. the acura and x5d have almost identical 0-60 times on paper, but when you drive them, they couldnt feel more different when you accelerate from a standstill or punch it on the highway. "
sweendogy,August 2012," yeah buddy where were you 2 mths ago when i was getting killed on these boards - trying to save the manuals - good for you man- lots of guys on this board are auto lovers - but also claim to be enthusiast, they will talk dsg, dct, cvt all day long, one guy even mentioned lamborghini as being now auto only as his argument- pretty funny stuff.enjoy the ride.

"
habitat1,August 2012," and that was interesting homework, but i dont quite get it. the ""take rate"" for the tl is 5%, but the odds of one being sold is 6305 to 1?? 5% is a lot closer to the actual sales ratios ive heard.interestingly, we came very close to getting a 2012 cayenne 6-speed manual instead of a bmw x5d. beautiful black on back one at auto palace in pittsburgh. if it wasnt for the fact that its just a hair too small inside and i didnt really want to pay porsche service costs for the next 10 years and 150k miles, we would have gone for it. hondaing to your article, that one has a take rate of 1.3% and an odds of 37,000 to one. which means that at 5,000 to 1 for a hole in one, i should get 7+ aces if i let my wife get the cayenne? maybe i should rethink that.thanks for posting your sources. still not sure why the ""take rate"" and ""odds of selling"" are so at odds with one another. but at least i will know to never question your homework skills again. "
sweendogy,August 2012," take it up with motor trend, its not my article as i didnt write it, i used it as a resource. i was surprised about the toyota number, also 50/50 rate on the s5 is pretty cool (save the manuals)btw how are you getting to the number you heard? and yes i only post numbers that are researched, why clutter the board with jargon or opinion when talking about specific numbers. "
markcincinnati,August 2012," the 3% number for premium car with manual transmissions is the number the enthusiasts magazines used in 2010. i would assume the number has declined what with the increase in excellent 6, 7, and 8 speed ""clutchless"" automatics.for those of you who see no merit in comparing a tl sh-awd to an s4, i do understand your incredulity. i was exactly in that mind-set until i drove the two car back to back one long afternoon of test driving in june or july, 2011.there is no way the s4 is not more satisfying and overall believable as a performance car. nevertheless, the tl sh-awd with the 19"" wheels, driven exactly over the same test drive route and the same speeds (up to 90mph) feels somewhat like a diluted s4. the s4 is the better machine, there is no argument from me on that point. where i found myself able to rationalize and accept the tl (after 29 audi in a row) was when i contented the two similarly and found the audi required an msrp bump in excess of $11,000. i live in cincinnati, a small honda or a big town, replete with at least twice-daily traffic clogs on our three interstates. the chances, my chances, that is, of being able to ever tap the potential of the s4 continue to erode -- although there remain a few chances to make forward progress at speeds in excess of 65mph. the s4 does rip through the tls performance envelope, but the tl sh-awd with the 19"" wheel and tire upgrade rips through most other car performance envelopes -- but even then, there is a decreasing window of opportunity to use its performance.i have not been drinking any kool-aid -- i am not suggesting you should succumb to the price differential if you are willing and able to pay the price for an s4 prestige with several options that crank its price up over 5 figures more than the tl.what i am suggesting, or asking, is that you do test drive a tl sh-awd advance or tl sh-awd tech with the upgraded wheels and tires and with the super slick 6-speed stick.it is difficult to learn to love, let alone like, the tls nose and butt, and the interior has ""too much honda"" in it -- but damn, the tl sh-awd advance can be loaded up with options and leased for less than $550 per month for 36 months. if you have not driven this car equipped thusly, i believe you will be impressed.i do not believe you will think you are driving an s4, i believe you may think of the tl sh-awd advance as a ""second cousin, twice removed,"" however. :shades: "
flightnurse,August 2012," what a horrible article, first off the volkswagen, toyota manuals are regional, my zip code you can not build a volkswagen volkswagen or toyota toyota with a manual. i believe this a east coast thing. "
habitat1,August 2012," o.k., i think i figured it out.the ""take rate"" of 5% for the tl means that 5% of all tls in 2010 were manual transmissions. the 1 in 6305 odds of being sold means that of all car sold in the us in 2010, 1 in 6,305 was a manual tl.test: the ""take rate"" on the toyota was 3%, but the odds were 1 in 1237. which if you do the math backwards, implies that there were about 8.5 times as many toyota sold in the us than tls. hondaing to the site ltoyotaed below, total tl sales were 34,039 in 2010 and total toyota sales were 327,804. thats 9.5 times as many, but given motor trend rounded the ""take rate"" to the nearest percent, is within the rounding error. sales by modellooking at it another way, total car sales in the us were 11,371,674 in 2010. odds of one of those car being a manual tl, 1 in 6305 = 1,804 total. odds of one of those being a manual toyota, 1 in 1,237 = 9,193 total. odds of one of those being a manual cayenne, 1 in 37,361 = 304 total. p.s. i personally test drove 1.3% of all manual cayennes made in 2010 (1 gts and 3 v6s). does that make me an ""expert""??cheers. "
sweendogy,August 2012," article is what it is, its a well respected car mag and you have the right to dissagree with it. manuals for the toyota were dropped in 2012, prob the reason you cant build a manual in the region, or any region in the us, data cited was 2010. volkswagen you can still for 2012 get the volkswagen base s model without sunroof with a 6 speed. dont know if this goes away for 2013.i think your responce was incorrect. "
sweendogy,August 2012," nice work on crunching the numbers. i dont get the ""expert"" part but for sure you were one of very few who drive such a car. "
flightnurse,August 2012," sweeny im not incorrect, back in 2010 a co worker who moved from nc to phx, had a 2010 toyota se 4 cyl with a 6 spd manual, when i told him that you cant buy one here in phx, he was shocked. toyota has been doing this for years, having regional car, now not too sure why one could not buy a se with a stick nationwide.if you type in 28201 (charlotte,nc) you can build yourself a volkswagen with 6 spd just as you stated, however, when type 85006, no 6 spd manual. so again, horrible article, if someone was to read tha article then they would think they should be able to to buy one. "
flightnurse,August 2012," p.s. i personally test drove 1.3% of all manual cayennes made in 2010 (1 gts and 3 v6s). does that make me an ""expert""?? in the sense of what the term expert means, yes. btw, when i test drove a cayenne gts, i was very surprised how the size shrunk the faster i drove it. btw, the gts models that porsche builds imo is the best one to get just the right amount of go fast goodies and luxury combined. "
flightnurse,August 2012," it appears that volkswagen has built a volkswagen version with a diesel engine in europe and has been selling very well. volkswagen is thinking of bring it over here to the states, it gets the larger hp rated 2l diesel that we get here 170hp and 250lbs of torque. the torque is up slightly, but the hp is up by 30, so what do you guys think of this? "
sweendogy,August 2012, flight just because you cant build a volkswagen with a manual in a certain region doesnt mean you cant go to the dealer and ask them to order one.. 
sweendogy,August 2012," glad your an expert- or in the sense of the term means- i drove a 2010 gts cayenne for a day- agree the rig does get tight faster, never drove the base or the turbo so dont know if they are just as good, but car was pretty tight for an suv "
habitat1,August 2012," i wasnt being serious.... no ""expert"" title for me....i was just making a joke based upon the fact that i actually test drove 1.3% of all manual transmission cayennes porsche sold in 2010. to achieve the same ""experience"" with a toyota, i would have had to test drive about 4,200 car.

nyccarguy,August 2012," i guess i expect all bmw to drive kinda like my 328xi does. i drove that 650i convertible and it didnt feel very nimble. you are right, i expect more from a car settings in ""sport plus"" mode. i just felt like i was driving an sl made by bmw. maybe thats their target market (look, its pretty & you can fit 2 volkswagen bags in it. drive it to the country club, then take your wife to dinner. no sacrifice in ride toyota...) "
nyccarguy,August 2012," thats what im thinking stick. my current 328xi (with its 230 hp) is no rocket, but definitely fast enough.like i toyota before, i may not like the way the new f30 328xi (2.0 t 4cyl, electric power steering) drives nor will i want to part with the better part of $50k to get one. so if i do stick with an ellps, ill probably end up with what i love.if a bmw bmw w/o nav were to pop up for sale around the time my lease is up, it might be worth a look. i rarely use the nav & would easily give it up for a sport pkg car. those sport seat are perfect for my 510"" 150# fdodgee:)edit: i see the link from bmwusas site doesnt work. the car is an 09 335xia (sorry sweendogy) with premium, sport, probably cold weather with only 24k miles. ltoyotaed for $31,499.it wont be too much more than the lease buy out on my 328xi that will have 50k miles on it. just thinking out loud as always. "
habitat1,August 2012," i guess i expect all bmw to drive kinda like my 328xi does.forget it, at least until bmw goes on a serious weight loss progdodge. i know vehicle weight isnt the only factor, but how can you have a ""nimble feel"" when a car like the 650ic weighs over 4,500 lbs. here are some weights from ultra fit to morbidly obese. any surprise that the order represents how nimble the vehicles feelboxster: 2,888 lbsboxster s: 2,910 lbs911 c2: 3,042 lbs 911 s cab: 3,318 lbs z4: 3,549panamera: 3,880sl550: 3,935 (2012 model was 4,200)bmw: 4,192cayenne v6: 4,398650ic: 4,531i know the ltoyota ranges from sports car to suvs, but in almost every case bmw has ballooned up in weight more than most of its competition. audi was previously the fatso with many of their car, but bmw is giving them a waddle for their money. and not that shaving 265 lbs off the sl was much more than kicking a deck chair off the queen mary, but at least mercedes is trying to go in the right direction. the fact that the e class is now leaner than the 5 series is, imo, embarrassing to bmw. "
graphicguy,August 2012," mark....i certainly understand what youre saying. i do like the current tl sh awd. i even like the styling (pre-nose surgery). but, i think you and i are probably in the minority.i saw the announcement for the new rl. looks quite interesting. also will be interesting what will happen with the tl, given the new update to the honda. seeing pics, and seeing reading the ""updates"", im not so certain that it will be a revolutionary update vs an evolutionary one. i do think the tl is going to need a revolutionary one. then again, much of its competition is pretty long-in-the-tooth, too. the es/is certainly hasnt been revolutionary, neither has the g (although it looks like its due for an update based on the new nissan).since you know the cincinnati area like i do, i took the gfs s4 to amish country a couple of weeks ago. its a great drive, over some great roads. as most know, the s4 has a dsg dual clutch trans. frankly, it simply outperformed any manual trans ive ever driven....and ive driven a lot of them....some good, some bad. this trans trumped all of them, regardless what measurement you use.it downshifts at precisely the moment it needs to (does the same for upshifting, and also double clutches precisely when it needs to. in addition, it snaps of shifts way faster than i ever thought i could. it magically seems to know what gear to be in, too.nyc.....my bmw trans is close in performance, but not quite what the s4 trans can do.if i can get that kind of performance out of auto/manual transmissions, i wont need a manual. "
habitat1,August 2012," if i can get that kind of performance out of auto/manual transmissions, i wont need a manual.im going to go out on a limb here and suggest that no one in this forum needs a manual or a dsg. if i have offended any formula one drivers, my apologies. ive driven the new 911s with pdk transmission. hondaing to the experts (the real ones, not me) its crisper, faster and better than any other dual clutch auto manual made, including ferraris latest and greatest. but it just doesnt give me that same sense of involvement and satisfaction. thats really what its all about for me. and, i suspect, most others that prefer a three pedal manual transmission. analogy: when i volkswagen, i like to play the course from the tips (7,000+ yard back tees). i know its likely to add 2-3+ strokes to my score over 18 holes, but i get more enjoyment playing the entire course than cut out 500+ yards so i can pat myself on the back for a slightly better score. there are some car - the tl especially - in which the manual is clearly better than a traditional slushbox automatic in performance, objectively and subjectively. but there are other car - the s4 and 911 to name two - in which the transmission choice merely represents a personal ""engagement"" preference. agree? "
sweendogy,August 2012," really where were you 3 mths ago? totally agree &#150; be prepaired for auto lovers rechevrolet, dsg and volkswagens new automated manuall, someone will hit you with a lamborghini comment about how all there car are now auto- "
mcdawgg,August 2012," buying my 2010 6 speed manual toyota:my local region did not allow you to choose a manual on the toyota website. when i picked a zip code far enough east, it allowed me to pick a manual. my local dealers would order one for me, but i did not go that route because i know the price would be higher. so i looked at the dealer website inventories for the zip codes that were in the region that the toyota website allowed you to pick a manual toyota, and sure enough, some dealers had them on the lot, although not many.bottom line is you could get one any where in the country, although in some regions, your dealer would have to order it.

rayainsw,August 2012," the mercedes mercedes, lexus is and es and the audi audi earned the worst rating, ""poor,"" in the new test.fwiw:http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/14/autos/luxury-car-crash-test/insubaru.html?hpt=hp_t- 1 "
jeffm5,August 2012," i took delivery of a volvo volvo t5 3 weeks ago. very happy to see that it, along with the tl and infiniti g, earned the top rating honors. "
nyccarguy,August 2012, tell us what you think of your volvo. what other car did you look at besides it? 
ivan_99,August 2012," i like the mercedes response...paraphrasing (liberally)...""obviously, if we didnt do well the test is flawed""  "
fedlawman,August 2012," well the crash tests are very specific so the manufacturers can (and do) design the car to pass the tests - regardless of whether it adds to the overall safety of passengers or not. im not super mazdar with euro ncap standards, but ive heard they are different (offset impacts, pedestrian protection, etc.). perhaps the euro standards are at odds with some us standards so the germans have to decide which test they want to design the car for? "
ivan_99,August 2012," yeah, i think the euro ncap recently updated the pedestrian safety specifications, im not certain the north american tests have anything specific for pedestrians.i just admire the brashness of their statement i assume all manufacturers will eventually pass this test with a good since some already do; hopefully not at a detriment to weight or cost... "
nyccarguy,August 2012," these crash tests do change all the time. just because the car im looking at didnt do well in the latest ""test"" wouldnt detract me from buying it. i consider mercedes to be at the fore front of safety. i remember my 2007 x3 got either a ""5 star"" or ""best pick"" safety rating, then in 2008 the x3s ranking went way down. am i to think that a 2008 x3 is a death trap compared to the 2007 i had? i dont think so.next year it will be the iihs ""batwing test"" where the mercedes mercedes performed better than every luxury brand in protecting occupants when batmans ""batwing"" is dropped on top of it. "
m6user,August 2012," ""i remember my 2007 x3 got either a ""5 star"" or ""best pick"" safety rating, then in 2008 the x3s ranking went way down. am i to think that a 2008 x3 is a death trap compared to the 2007 i had? i dont think so.""its a long way from ""the rating went down"" to ""death trap"". wow, exaggeration to make a point is always helpful, right? the tests are what they are and they dont change substantially from year to year and they apply to all manufacturers equally. are they perfect? no, but they are better than nothing. some of the comments here sound like mercedes. if one doesnt like the results the tests are flawed. if a manufacturer at least, makes it safe enough to get a good rating i would have to believe it is a little safer than one that didnt. please notice i toyota a ""little safer"". the ratings dont go from ""you will not be harmed"" directly to ""death trap"". pleeeease. "
flightnurse,August 2012," hey nyc, some thing else to loo into, the 650i weights more then you 328, this will offset how is handles too. "
m6user,August 2012," i have to temper my last post with the understanding that the frontal crash test was in fact substantially changed and is now an offset front end crash against a stationary object. the old test simulated a headon with another vehicle. dont know what changed from 2007 to 2008 though. still, the fact remains the test applies to all equally and that these ratings do not go from absolutely safe to death trap as there are gradations and even the lowest rating would not be classified as inherently unsafe. "
jeffm5,August 2012," ive had the volvo for 3 weeks and im very happy with my choice. i test drove a buick, volkswagen cc, tsaturns, hyundai. ive always been impressed with the es 350, but there are so many of them here in western pa. i wanted something different.before i give my impressions of the volvo there a couple things you need to know. i was coming out of a 2005 toyota limited, which was a great car. this is a loaded 2013 and is my first ""luxury/near luxury car."" the front seat toyota for both the passenger and driver are outstanding. all of the controls are on the steering wheel or within easy reach. handling is outstanding, power and acceleration are very good (this is my first turbo). visibility is very good. the car has a solid feel. no rattles. the ride is a little choppy on rough roads, very good otherwise. im getting 30+ on the highway at about 65 mph and around 24 in mixed driving on regular.the phone, radio, nav, etc. are accessed through the volvo sensus system, which works fine once you get past the learning curve. our cell phones, itouch work fine. the sensus/nav screen is not a touch screen. its 7 inches. i wish it was a little larger. the tach. and speedometer are not backlit. the interior has that orderly understated look, but, not surprisingly, lacks ""bling"". sensus is voice activated and works very well.i got all of the safety features, all of which seem to work as advertised. two of the best are adaptive cruise control and active bending xenon headlights. i find lane departure annoying, so ive shut it off. i dont let any of these ""safety nannies"" drive the car for me, but if they can give me a heads up, ill take it.on the downside are a tight back seat and no spare. there is an inflation kit in the trunk. this was almost a deal breaker for me. the dealer threw in a donut spare, which comes in a fabric zip bag and is strapped down in the trunk, a + $200 option. this makes a smallish trunk even smaller.volvo offers the safe and secure plan, which covers maintenance and repairs (even brakes) for 5 yrs. or 50,000 miles. (tires are not covered under this plan.)the car is very fun to drive and im happy with it. hope this helps. "
sweendogy,August 2012," jeffm - thanks for the review - i found it interesting the car you cross shopped this against - ford and hyundai - car that when you think about them seem to be in a different category but when you dive deep they are very similar - why not another toyota , seems like toyota improved a bit on the old one and its a very near cousin to the es. the spare tire thing for me would of been an issue as well- the volvo have run flats? good luck with the new rig- refreshing to see a newer car talked about here. "

nyccarguy,August 2012, my exaggeration was an attempt at humor that obviously didnt translate well given the medium. i know the car was by no means considered a death trap. 
nyccarguy,August 2012, fantastic write up jeff. glad you are happy with your volvo;) 
stickguy,August 2012, i parked next to a black volvo with the saddle interior yesterday. very sharp. 
kyfdx,August 2012, interesting.. 
fedlawman,August 2012," auto start-stop was a little weird to me when i first got the chevrolet hybrid. now i rarely notice it.it may seem like an annoyance, but in real-life, its a non-issue. "
jeffm5,August 2012," we would have loved another toyota and were looking forward to the 2013. problem is the the front grill design, which we think is ugly. (no offense to those who find it sharp. these things are very subjective.)btw, the buick is an impressive car, but those wide a pillars were a deal breaker. "
robr2,August 2012, the tests are what they are and they dont change substantially from year to year.actually this this is a modification to an extoyotaing test. years ago the iihs decided that the head on test done by the government wasnt real world enough so they came out and tested offset crashes. the performance of most car was poor so it forced automakers to design to get a good rating on this test.now the iihs has moved the target and changed the offset test from moderate overlap to small overlap. the moving target is the way the insurance industry gets the automakers to keep making vehicles safer in order to reduce the payouts they have to make. 
graphicguy,August 2012," hey jeff...welcome. nice write up on your new volvo. congratulations.ray....thanks for the update. the couple of times i drove the new bmw with the start/stop feature, left a very negative impression. glad to see bmw recognizes they have a lot of work to do on the ""feature"" and has offered a way to permanently defeat it.frankly, im surprised it made it past engineering at bmw given how poorly the feature operates (as in, it shudders the entire car). "
ivan_99,August 2012," id like to see a cost/benefit analysis; how long will it take to pay for itself.i admit i havent follow this technology, but i cant image it saving a huge amount of fuel. plus im from the old school where its ingrained that starting an engine equates to damage done (excessive wear). "
andys120,August 2012," i admit i havent follow this technology, but i cant image it saving a huge amount of fuel.it would think depends on your driving environment. i could see start/stop saving 15-20% on fuel in traffic prone urban/chevrolet areas but out in the boonies perhaps less than 10%. "
kyfdx,August 2012," i think if you have a hybrid that already runs occasionally with the gas engine off... .its no big deal... and, either way, you could probably get used to it....but, i hated it, especially with the 4-cylinder.... and, if you had to disable it every time you started the car, that would be a non-starter for me... (pun intended, naturally..) "
sweendogy,August 2012," let me jump in here about the great bmw and its auto start - again its done so bmw can improve its mpg mandates - any gain is a good one, certainly when the 3 has to carry the line of bmw (x3,x5,x6 and m car) cafe results. to say the idea of turning a button off or on as a deal breaker is a joke, so many other dealbreakers somehow get overlooked - no spare tire and run flats 2 that come to mind - inflated price another. when i bought my g - a coworker who had one told me to save the breaks i should shut down the stability control every time i get in- i have done so everyday i owned the car, no idea if this has helped the pads (i keep it on in rain). i also put a seat belt on every day- also not a deal breaker for me. "
andys120,August 2012, i deliberately left the start/stop feature on during my 8 mile test loop in the new bmw and i could barely notice the start/stop.frankly the price tag is a lot more of a deal-breaker for me( i buy my bimmers well used to avoid the massive depreciation hit). 
nyccarguy,August 2012, i wonder if its just that much more noticeable on the n20 powered 328s. 
markcincinnati,August 2012," which model volvo did you go with? t5, t6 -- im sorry, the turbo comment may have been an indicator, but i cant recall if both the t5 and t6 are now (2013) turbos. "
markcincinnati,August 2012," shut down the stability control to save the brakes? how would shutting down this feature save either rotors or pads? ok, now i kind of get how if you push the car so that it ""needs"" to apply the left rear brake or right front brake or some combination in order to stabilize the car, you might save a bit of wear -- at the cost of reduced stability.but, if you are not in any situation that might require such an electronic intervention, why would turning the esp off be helpful? abs only comes into play when braking so hard that sliding tires are a possibility, but abs typically cannot be defeated (it is just always at attention, awaiting to be called upon). i would think esp causes no brake wear period if it is never engaged.seems like turning it off increases the danger of understeer, oversteer and out of control situations (on dry, wet or snow/ice surfaces alike -- albeit at lower speeds the slicker the surface becomes). :confuse: "
graphicguy,August 2012," nyc, ivan, andy, kyfdx, et al......i dont think fuel savings with auto on/off via the 3 series were anywhere near 10%. i remember reading somewhere that it amounted to 1% or so. again, that figure would vary depending on the amount of stop and go driving.i dont think anyone would object to the feature. however, it was implemented poorly, causing the entire car to shudder very noticeably on restart. not very becoming of a $40k-$50k car.both of the ones i drove were 4 cyl car. "
jeffm5,August 2012, its a t5 turbo. i think thats what the t stands for. 
qbrozen,August 2012," yes, both turbos. "
rayainsw,August 2012," is the jaguar xf [ now with available 4-cyl - or v6 and awd for 2013 ] seen as part of this group?- raymsrp now as low as $47,805.... "
sweendogy,August 2012," "" ok, now i kind of get how if you push the car so that it ""needs"" to apply the left rear brake or right front brake or some combination in order to stabilize the car, you might save a bit of wear -- at the cost of reduced stability. ""yeah thats what was told to me about possible reduced wear, on the stability - again i use it in rain and snow- but for everyday driving i like to feel in control my self- this stability control is a great safety feature for sure but growing up we did not have such a feature, so does it increase the danger factor, yes- but i like to live dangerously-- "
billyperksii,August 2012," ""but i like to live dangerously-- ""stay in new york or wherever you are from with that mindset. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," sweendogys a jersey guy. i think hes quoting austin powers.""i also like to live dangerously"" "
sweendogy,August 2012," yeah man- i just do it bc someone who i worked with toyota the dealer told him to do it to save his pads- again i went thru pads at 20k so did it help, i dont know. on the stability side i leave it on in the rain and snow - when its clear i actually like having the back slide out a bit every now and them- like to be engaged with the car - and not a computer . "
sweendogy,August 2012," actually bronx, now new england "
markcincinnati,August 2012," esp is one of the (car and driver says its the #1) best applications of technology for safety and performance. the possible increase in wear is almost certainly minimal. your ability to turn it on when you think youll need it is an interesting approach -- to me it seems like saying ""ill only fasten my seat belt when i think i will wreck.""the value of esp is probably its most profound in those situations where you cant see or know for certain there is a coefficient of friction issue. or even when it is not raining or snowing, it is possible to get yourself into an understeering situation or even oversteer before you know it and at that exact moment in time i would doubt someone could react and push the esp ""on"" button. im not too sure you really want to live that dangerously?!?do you turn off your abs too? (assuming you had one of the very few car that allow that anymore as audi used to allow.) "
sweendogy,August 2012," mark thanks for your concern but no need for lectures- ive read the same articles you quote- and like i toyota before stability control is a great feature but again what did we do without it- my answer is cope with the situation at hand - if my car is a little loose in a turn i have 3 options - break, off gas, on gas - ive been to a number of schools and seem enuf situations to know what to do at a certain time - i also dont drive like an a-hole so i should be able to adapt in most situations. if i loose it its on me- i know most here love the espn and cvts but for me i like the feeling of driving. ( again in rain and snow, and on roads i dont know i keep it on)- i also buckle up - every time, never know when a guy with an audi or tl awd type s sh-awd will t-bone me at a light while hes texting .enjoy the cvt and espn and the computers- but i dontcant turn off the abs - but yes, answer your question yes i like to live ""that"" dangerously -like my old man with his 79 nova, i drive without espn. 2007 pontiac5, 31k miles and not a curb mark. dont be a dink "
m6user,August 2012," ""and like i toyota before stability control is a great feature but again what did we do without it- ""a lot more of us were killed....thats what we did. stability control is probably the most helpful in an extreme emergency manuever. just like abs it helps keep the car under control. if you think you know for sure exactly when the next yahoo is going to run you off the road or pull out in front of you and you need to control your car than you should be a fortune teller. traction control is pretty useful too. what did i do before traction control? i spun my rear wheels all over the place in the snow even with good snow tires.its obvious you think youre mario andretti and could also care less if losing control of your car causes someone elses injury or death. and you are telling others not to be a dink? look in the mirror my friend.btw, i havent heard that term used in about thirty years. maybe its a regional thing. kind of thought that went the way of ""fairy hooks"" if anybody remembers that one. "
ivan_99,August 2012," back in 2002 i had a 2003 pontiac5 when they were first released.i too had the traction/stability turned off in dry weather.the car was very well balanced and i would give it a little power to bring the rear end 6-12 inches out. it would always tuck back in and straighten out. youd really...really have to try hard in order to spin out of control (i never had); it was very predictable and constoyotaent.this wasnt a big nhra burnout...but a small chirp of the tires with the engine revving and i didnt do it at every corner (that was when i was 16...) or near the daycare; just the odd time to remember my youth.probably not the utmost ideal level of safety, but neither was the time i took a call on my mobile phone, reached across to the passenger foot-well to pick something up, fiddled with the radio selection, reached behind me to put a pacifier in the babys mouth...and took it way past the posted limit on the highway (no baby in the car then). btw, this didnt occur all in one day but the span of a couple years.sometimes i eat too much red meat...but i wouldnt consider myself reckless :shades: "
tlong,August 2012," shut down the stability control to save the brakes?if you dont wear your seat belts it saves the springs in the retractors, too.  "
rayainsw,August 2012," r&t did a tech article on start\stop technology in their june issue. [ for some reason, still not posted on their web site. ] they rated 10 systems [ a couple with both automatic and manual transmissions ] and the bmw 328 was the only system that was graded as low as c or d in rating &#145;smoothness, predictability, confidence&#146;. and both automatic and manual bmw versions were rated their lowest grades - c = &#145;noticeable but acceptable&#146; or d = &#145;dtoyotaracting&#146;.others rated were buick, honda, infiniti, kia, m-b, porsche and toyota.odd.- raynote &#150; bmw&#146;s system &#145;throbs&#146; . . . "
sweendogy,August 2012," bmw - thanks for the post, it reads the same as marks but when you put the word ""killed"" in it - wow powerful stuff.... so this stability control is very useful-- i got it now-- thanks man--mario andretti comment-- again - powerful = i will never touch that button again... dink comment- again you are right.. im going to look in the visor mirrior "
graphicguy,August 2012," ray....bmw stop/start tech seems to follow a trend with them. like their idrive, it took 2-3 generations for them to get it right. same is probably true for their start/stop tech. it will take them 2-3 releases (maybe even model years) to get it right.surprising, given bmw engineering prowess, and their early adoption of technology in car. no matter, since the feature can be totally defeated, that fixes what was an unnecessary and ill-implemented attempt to increase mpg. "
fedlawman,August 2012, is start/stop on all 3series car or just north american car? 
nyccarguy,August 2012, my bad sweendogy. thats just like me. i live in ct (new england) & work in the bronx. 
graphicguy,August 2012, fed...not sure if start/stop is on any other bmw models other than the 3 series! 
laurasdada,August 2012," at least in the jaguar pantheon, it is ""entry level."" with the death of the dearly beloved x-type  the xf became the poor mans special... but, in size and price, its really a lps. imho, of course. "
sweendogy,August 2012," drove my complete commute today - 7 miles with esp on- think i toped out at 30mph- saw alot of bikers on the local roads- 85 degrees - no rain . the car with esp drives very similar when its off - one other thing to note - used my bluetooth on the ride home, first time since april, asked the wife if she wanted me to pick up dinner, she toyota no - already made something - with the esp on i felt safer in making such a call. "
robr2,August 2012," ...yesterday i took a left turn in front of a black cadillac ctv coupe. very mean looking.as i passed the driver, i was stunned to see this lady driving it:so much for stereotypes... "
flightnurse,August 2012," i read someplace that the auto stop/start can be turn off completely by having the bmw dealer updating the the software. basically the update allows the computer to ""remember"" the last function of this feature. so if you turned it off when you got into the car and turned the car off, then the computer remember this and the system is turned off when the car is restarted. on a side note my neighbor has 2007 bmw bmw, been having some issues with the a/c, he bought it as a cpo, the car is back in the shop, he has a 2012 bmw, the dealer forgot to tell him about the auto stop/start, when he left the dealership with the loaner, he came up a light, waited, the car stopped. at first he wasnt too sure the issue, went back to the dealership with the car where they explained this feature. he doesnt like it... he liked the car overall, but not that feature, i explained about the computer update the dealership can do with it. "
flightnurse,August 2012," fed, i believe it is on all euro 3 series, from the 316 to bmw. i believe for 2013 all bmw;s will get it in europe. will be interesting to see how this feature will increase mpg on the big 760is "
flightnurse,August 2012," rob the last big cts commercial i saw had a 30 something female driving the cts. there is a black cts-v down the street from me with custom graphic on saying ""barrett-jackson"" on the side. the diver is a middle-age lady, i also found out that she is the wife of the vp of barrett jackson the car also have manufacture plates on it. nice perk... he drives a black on black on black hummer h2 with manufacture plates. "
m6user,August 2012, here is one article on the bmw 3 reprogdodgeming for the start/stop from about 5 days ago. it was also on several other car related sites.http://www.autoblog.com/2012/08/13/bmw-allowing-dealers-to-re-progdodge-start-stop- /

graphicguy,August 2012," fn.....of all the positive attributes my bmw possesses, the a/c isnt one of them. it works....but not nearly as well as my former tl or the gfs s4.agree with you....braking hard, in a corner, stability control off? somebody is swapping ends. wonder which driving school teaches that techntoyotaue? :p "
sweendogy,August 2012," who toyota ""hard breaking""? - enjoy the computers and auto transmissions you auto enthusiast. "
billyperksii,August 2012," sween, dont you drive a 5 speed auto tranny pontiac5?so what is all the rant about auto tranny?honestly, i wanted the manual tl but i know my wife drives my car ever so often. my plan (if i ever get around to it) is to purchase acura type s with the stick as a beater car. hopefully in the 3k to 4k range, then i can probably join your club and rant all day about manuals  "
sweendogy,August 2012," my ""rant"" is with car guys who say the auto is better car- not the guys who get the auto because the wife is driving, i understand some factors restrict certain transactions. i have a pontiac5x - (traded a volkswagen gli) and would have gotten stick if it was offered, but infiniti on awd car does not, i live in new england, its a shame which ive mentioned here in forums and have written to infiniti as well. could i have bought a 335, audi, tl or others but for the money it was a no brainer. closest thing was the tl- and have you seen the face of those ? "
m6user,August 2012," it seems that if someone really, really wants a stick shift they wouldnt let a little snow stop them. ive heard so many times that proper snows and traction control let rwd car compete heads up with an awd car with all seasons. now add to that scenario someone that likes to live a little dangerously in the first place and it seems like a pretty lame excuse blaming the car company.i grew up in michigan on stick shifts with rwd with no esp, traction control or abs brakes on bias ply tires. still alive somehow. "
flightnurse,August 2012," sweeny what is interesting is how you turn peoples words around. the ""people"" you say ""car guys who say the auto is better car"" no one has stated that, what has been toyota is, that the newer generation auto have become just as good as car with manual transmission. now a true auto enthusiast understand this. there will always be people who will have to have a manual car, and there will always be people who will want an auto. neither is right or wrong, but for some reason you have made it a point to say, that people who choose an auto is a lessor person for that choice. so why doesnt infiniti build a infiniti with a manual? is is a lessor car then say a audi audi or bmw bmw ? "
flightnurse,August 2012," hey bmw, my partner is from flint and he says the same thing, and car today with traction control and rwd can get around in snow very well, since most of the car mags are based in ann arbor michigan, and not all of the long term car have awd, they do not seem to have a problem driving in the snow. they just change the tires to some good snow tires and drive.... "
flightnurse,August 2012," graphic what is interesting is how poor the germans a/cs are, way back in 1986 i bought a 190e 2.3-16 (wish i had that car today) the a/c was ok living in san diego. in 1988 i bought a mb 300sdl (for work) and again in san diego the a/c was ok, but get that car in the desert (las vegas, phoenix, and or yuma) and the a/c was not ok... over the years the germans have done better, my 330 i dont have the problem as i did with the 300sdl, the 330 can keep me cold all day.. however, the japanese have always had a good a/c unit in their car. "
flightnurse,August 2012," hey sweeny doesnt your pontiac5 have traction control (computer), and an auto ? so how are you enjoying your sports sedan, you auto enthusiast? "
sweendogy,August 2012," no excuse. i found the value of the infiniti a no brainer when compared to anything in its class- i have nav awd and 300hp for 36500- thats what i paid - no other car came close. whos blaming a car company,? if they has the demand and the ""car enthusiasts"" asked for it they would build it. like i toyota, i have written them to chevrolet my thoughts. michigan, i would def have to esp on of traveling - i also think modern car that have snow tires are better then standard slicks, but add snows to awd in vermont and its a mt lion. again i dont live dangerously in snow and rain conditions. i know your comment was ment as a diss, but i dont play with my life.

"
sweendogy,August 2012," i did say that, but prob should re-read the response in context.i think the rwd starts at 42. tad higher "
m6user,August 2012," are you kidding? the awd is $1600 more than the rwd. pretty much like any other car manufacturer in the world the awd is more than a rwd or fwd. why twtoyota things? youre the one that is always touting that you do your research and deal in facts.2012 infiniti dodge = $37,7952012 infiniti base = $39,395 "
sweendogy,August 2012," title of your post is - stick shift - correct ? we were talking about stick vs auto correct- the g with the stick is 41500. i do research, you cant get a dodge with stick, i also respond to what we we were talking about - talk about doing the twtoyota. "
m6user,August 2012," sorry, i stand corrected. didnt know you couldnt get the dodge with a stick shift. wasnt trying to twtoyota...just a mtoyotaake. but you didnt include destination chg($895) so the price is really even more which is $42395.however, the sport model is loaded with equipment that is not found on the infiniti so after adding similar equipment like the prem. pkg and nav the msrp on the infiniti is actually $43,745 which is more than the infiniti sport. you may have paid $36,500 but you would have gotten a similar deal on the sport model. just saying that if you wanted the stick it would have been very close in price and equipment just minus the awd. "
sweendogy,August 2012," np thats why i do research- another thing to add at the time when i bought my g- they car where structured a bit differently - the stick shifts were very rare and the ones on dealer lots were demos- infact they all got one sport when the new body came out in 2007. so to say i would of gotten a similar deal is wishful thinking, i needed a car- did the research and was able to hammer out a deal; 31k miles later no probs - i would trade in a second for a 42k infiniti stick, or a 2012 335x equiped the same at 42k (not going to happen) i think its a fantastic value in sedan formthe destination charge same on all infiniti "
graphicguy,August 2012," fn...it could be that weve had one of the hottest summers i can remember here in sw oh. but, my 3s a/c struggled with 90+ degree heat. under that temp, it was fine. gfs s4 a/c, set on 74 deg would freeze you out., even when it hit 100+ deg. "
flightnurse,August 2012," graphic, i wasnt traveling the week we hit 118, and my 3 had no problem in stop and go traffic, you might want to have your checked. i would assume if my 3 can handle 118 then yours should too... so hows the s4 ? "
habitat1,August 2012," but it sounds to me like a tl sh-awd 6 speed manual discounted to $36,000 would be the best of all worlds, compared to the forced compromises of the infiniti awd vs. manual. thats assuming you could get past the need for a nose and butt job.too bad acura snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory when they redesigned the tl from the generation i have (2004). im sure those unemployed pontiac designers that they hired could have found work eventually. "
sweendogy,August 2012," loved the acura shifter, power good, service, awd, but felt a little big- hated the look- and very busy dash- loved my past acura- not this one. - im not the only one, as sales numbers indicate. "
graphicguy,August 2012, fn...i think youre right. i need to get the a/c checked.tl sh awd handled better than a g awd. 
sweendogy,August 2012," ""tl handled better...."" i havent seen any direct comparison tests done on the 2.. would love to see the article- ive always wondered because the tl does have the sh-awd vs infiniti setup of rwd bias. please expand on this statement. "
graphicguy,August 2012," fn....s4 is really a great car. very fast, handles really well, ride is firm but toyotaable...seems like the faster you drive it, the better it handles road imperfections. gf and i both are thrilled with it.that toyota, i like my 3, just for different reasons. "
billyperksii,August 2012," ""too bad acura snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory when they redesigned the tl from the generation i have (2004). im sure those unemployed pontiac designers that they hired could have found work eventually."" i toyota the same when i had my 2003 (so big deal), i went to the auto show and saw the 2004- my first response was blah- too honda and camrish, just did not stand out as an entry level luxury.all the talk about beak this and beak that, if you put a infiniti, 2004-2008 tl and the 4g tl side by side, the 4g tl stands out as closest to entry level luxury. trust me, i have seen the 3g and 4g tl side by side at the dealer and the 3g looks so yi have gotten infinite compliments on my tl, as a matter of fact it turned 3 years old last friday and i took it to a local garage for a rotation and balance, the service guy asked if it was a new car- he toyota its really nice.this is just my ho.  "
flightnurse,August 2012, graphic but does the tl sh awd drive better then a bmw ? that is really the biggest question! 
habitat1,August 2012," if you prefer the looks of the 4g tl than good for you - because you are getting a heck of a good car beneath the skin.my ""snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory"" comment was really aimed at acura shareholders, since sales of the 2009 tl, upon the redesign, dropped by well over 50% from what the 2004 model sold. and that was in a large part to the controversial looks. heres the chart: tl sales by year bmw had bangle to contend with, not sure who at acura decided all of a sudden that lots of chrome was in fashion, but it cost the company dearly in terms of sales. but, like i toyota, for those that can get past - or even prefer - the looks of the new tl, a 2012 tl sh-awd 6-speed manual for $36,000 +/- is one hell of a good deal. maybe not quite the enthusiast car as a 335xi, but about $15k cheaper comparably equipped. "
billyperksii,August 2012, can you pull the same data for infiniti and lexus?- same time period. 
habitat1,August 2012," that particular chart source only showed htoyotaorical tl sales. im sure if you google searched around, you could find something similar for infiniti and lexus, as well as bmw and audi. if its any consolation, my old nissan se, which was a top seller in the 1990s and won coty honors in 1995, has pretty much fallen off the ellps radar screen for most car shoppers today. i dont have the exact figures handy, but i think the current nissan is selling at about 15% of the sales volume of my old 1995. nissan really snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory on that one! "
m6user,August 2012, it got fat and got a cvt. pretty much explains it imo. 
habitat1,August 2012," agreed. and until the most recent design, went fugly as well. the current nissan doesnt look half bad to me on the outside, but nissan completely sold its soul as a ""four door sports car"" at least a decade ago. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," is an ellps shopper right now. his 2008 audi 3.2 fwd s line threw a rod at 39,000 miles. luckily the dealer he had it towed to diagnosed the problem as hydrolock. his insurance company didnt think it was worth footing the $21,000 bill for a new engine, so they are going to total the car.his top choice is a infiniti (09 or 10 cpo). hes also going to look at some cpo bmw w/ sport pkg. ill keep you guys updated.

sweendogy,August 2012, http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2012/08/usa-best-selling-luxury-vehicles-july-2012.- htmllittle research that bmwuser knows i love. looks like the acura re-due on the beak is helping its ytd numbers. surprised to see the hyundai has outsold the tl and audi (by a few car) ytd thou. enjoy the link 
tlong,August 2012," i have gotten infinite compliments on my tl, as a matter of fact it turned 3 years old last friday and i took it to a local garage for a rotation and balance, the service guy asked if it was a new car- he toyota its really nice. speaking as an 05 tl owner, these generations of tls are like girlfriends. the 04-08 (call her ""julie"") is a couple of years older with an absolutely gorgeous face and a decent body. the 4g tl (call her ""flo"") is the girl with the killer body but the somewhat doggy face!ill keep julie and you enjoy flo! "
tlong,August 2012," if its any consolation, my old nissan se, which was a top seller in the 1990s and won coty honors in 1995, has pretty much fallen off the ellps radar screen for most car shoppers today.around 2000 i was driving my audi 2.8 audi and when i was in for a service call i ended up with a rental nissan. i thought that it had a great stereo and great power but that the handling and suspension were extremely underwhelming. the back end in particular felt bouncy. but of course i was coming from the audi with a stick and sport package. "
graphicguy,August 2012," fn......first and foremost, i consider the tl sh awd to be in somewhat the same general vicinity as the bmw x. however, 335 is faster, handles better, and of course is less expemsive. tl still tugs on the steering wheel a little bit....even in awd form. still, for the money, youd be hard pressed to find a car that mixes all of the attributes of torque vectoring, strong and smooth motor, top notch feature set of the tl sh awd.its cheap to keep, too. "
flightnurse,August 2012," what price point does one have to hit to be considered to be ellps? what equipment does a car need to be considered a ellps? what is the balance between luxury and sport? all this talk about the tl sh awd being just as good as s4 and bmw, so is the only tl that can be considered a ellps? fn "
habitat1,August 2012," thanks for posting that data source - it is a great one to look through.however, not sure how you concluded that the tls minor facelift has made much of a difference in sales? the ytd numbers are up slightly (12% +/-) through july 2012 vs. 2011, but they are also now giving away the car with up to $9,000 discounts. and the slight ytd bump is still nowhere near the sales volume of the worst/last year of the previous model. heres the grim stattoyotaical truth about the acura tl:2004-2006 total us sales: 227,461 (this is fwd only car, 1st 3 years after 2004 redesign. average annual = 75,820. up 37% from previous model, which still averaged 58k units last two years of its ""aged"" design"")2009-2011 total us sales: 98,906 (this in spite of now offering both fwd, awd models with 2 different engines. average annual 32,969; down 57% from previous model and down over 25,000 average sales from last two years of 2002-2003 model)you cant look at this in any way, shape or form (literally) and not call the 2009 acura redesign a total screw up from a business perspective. acura pumped tons of money into producing two drivetrains, two engine vhondants of the tl and sales ended up getting cut by well more than half thanks to going to pontiac for aesthetic advice and to raid their chrome stockpile. even porsche, for all of their ford on engineering prowess, realizes that looks do matter and has continued to refine the classic 911 style. but acura was too smart for their own good, threw the 2004-2008 exterior in the trash and look what it got them. "
sweendogy,August 2012," ""discounts of up to 9k"", wow how pissed are owners of 2011s? "
stickguy,August 2012," you do have to keep in mind the market was vastly different in 2009-2011, with the recession having a major impact. plus of course, strong new competition in the segment.but, even my wife/daughter (who know zippo about car) when we passed a current gen beak tl toyota ""wow that is ugly"".the 2004? my favorite. i almost bought a 2001 new (great deal, but i was too tall to fit toyotaably, though i ended up with a 2000 for my son a few years back, so i have one in the family), and looked at the 2004 when it came out. imo< a huge improvement. better interior, more room, and also way better looking. "
graphicguy,August 2012," stick.....i do think that the 4g tls current styling is polarizing. that toyota, i remember when my dealer had a private showing for it when they first hit the street. i remember thinking how forward the styling was, which was something i liked. clearly, i was in the minority because i liked it.the driving toyotamics were quite a bit ahead of the 3g version, too. tech was better, materials were better....just about everything was better with the 4g.now, the polarizing styling has been ""smoothed"", other brands/models have caught up (and exceeded) tls tech. from a price/performance aspect (with some pretty hefty acura discounts), the tl (in sh awd form) is still a compelling buy.it will be interesting to see if acura makes the new rl(x)/tl(x) one model and drops the other. to me, the rl was never a real player in the lux field (e350, es350, audi). i believe acura could mine some gold with a ""tweener"", splitting the performance and lux difference between the tl and rl, having it priced hondaingly (mid $40k).well see. have heard of some nice specs on the new rl/tl car theyve been parading around the car shows.be interesting to see if acura rolls out a tl-s next year. that always boosts sales. "
flightnurse,August 2012," something else to consider, is acura more aggressive in its financing of the tl then ever before? i would have to say, yes. before acura (or honda) really never would deal on their car, but things have changed. so if someone is shopping purely on price, this could motivate people to buy a tl over say g even though the exterior isnt as nice at the g. "
stickguy,August 2012," funny thing is, not long ago there was a newer tl parked on my street, and i thought it looked really sharp. it was a real dark blue, and looked great in that color. but in almost every other color (especially light ones) i did not like it at all. "
billyperksii,August 2012," i see over on the infiniti board now you can lease one for $199, how infruiating it must be for the guys who are laying out $500+. "
habitat1,August 2012," ...why is there sh-awd system such a gas hog??compare the acura (16/21 epa) to a x5 3.5, ml 350 (both higher), or even a 400hp cayenne s v8. no, wait, compare it to a 500 hp cayenne turbo (roughly the same at 15/22). where is all that gas going?? the tl sh-awd (18/26) is below the e350 4-matic, 535xi (both 19/29), audi audi (19/28) and way, way below the bmw (33 highway).perhaps sh should be changed to sg for ""sucks gas"".i am probably connecting too many dots here, but when we test drove the new acura against the competition, i felt like acura put all of their time and attention into ""gizmos"" and not into decent, responsive automatic transmissions, engines and drivetrains for the current acura. the fact that everyone else seems to offer both better fuel efficiency and actual performance (the 300 horses in the x5 3.5i are way bigger horses than the ones in the acura) seems to reinforce my feelings.as for why the tl sh-awd gets 20% lower fuel efficiency than a faster, more powerful 335xi is a bit of a conundrum. "
sweendogy,August 2012," dont know- i dont lease. scrolling the infiniti board, nice- you looking to trade up/ price down? wow 199 a great price - but wonder how much you need to put down? maybe flight can land here with an answer. "
rayainsw,August 2012," i see nothing close to that - and the deals look to be low 3s to high 2s...?[ and those are with $$s down ]where did you see a infiniti lease at $199/mo?- rayacademic, today, but very interesting.... "
kyfdx,August 2012," once you factor in the required money up front, its closer to $400/mo...but, the leases are for only 18 months... so, its still a pretty good deal..our infiniti lease, which is ten months old... was for about $356 + tax.. for 36 months... so, we still feel okay...  "
graphicguy,August 2012," habitat....while not the usual honda/acura fuel economy leader that were used to, the 4g tl isnt too far off from what both my 335 and gfs s4 gets.real world numbers are a bit different.when i had my tl sh awd, i got about 18 mpg-19 mpg honda. it fell down a little bit on the highway, getting 22mpg, or 23 mpg on a good day with nice weather.the 335 gets about 20 mpg honda, but 28 mpg highway.the s4 (on a still green motor) gets 20 mpg honda and 26 mpg-27 mpg on the highway.i know the f30 3 series is supposed to make a big jump in mpg, but i havent seen any reports yet.be interesting to see if acura does indeed go to a hybrid drivetrain with the 5g and what performance and fuel economy is derived. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," ive figured out a different way home from work that has much less traffic than my normal route. hondaing to my 328xis trip computer, my average speed is up from 34 to over 44 mph. my gas mileage has improved too. i usually average about 20.5 mpg. this tank im up to 22.5. filled up one am before work & jumped right on 95. when i got off the highway, i checked the tc while sitting at a traffic light. average speed was 72 mph & average fuel economy was over 27 mpg.as ive toyota before, none of this matters because it still costs $60 - $70 to fill it up;) "
habitat1,August 2012," when i had my tl sh awd, i got about 18 mpg-19 mpg honda. it fell down a little bit on the highway, getting 22mpg, or 23 mpg on a good day with nice weather. i realize that ""real world numbers"" can vary significantly for the ""honda"" figure, depending upon how urban and stop and go the honda driving actually is. but that 22-23 highway number you have quoted for your tl-awd, unless its the autobahn at an average speed into the triple digits, really sucks. ive never had a car that low, or even an suv without a roof rack that low.my 2004 tl 6-speed is rated at 29 and will pretty constoyotaently get 29-31 mpg at 70-75 mph for a 300+ mile highway drive. my former 2005 911s cab, rated at 26, would constoyotaently get 27+ on a similar highway drive, top up. 26+ top down. my former 2002 honda s2000, rated at only 26, never got less than 28 and managed 32-33 on a few tankfuls cruising at 72-75. even our 2005 acura gets 23-24 on the highway, as long as we dont have bicycles on top. on our trip to and from north mazdaina last week (1,200 miles total, including the week we were there), with two bicycles on the roof coming and going, averaged just under 20 (19.7).none of my numbers are read from a trip computer or for a short stretch. they are calculated by me filling up before and after, for trips that are at least 250-350 miles. on the other hand, all of our ""honda"" mpgs suck no matter what we drive - welcome to dc. "
sweendogy,August 2012, real world mpgs in the g stink - 16 all in 90% honda.graph remember the battles on the tl board- any update on the information request above - or was that a general statement/ opinion? 
flightnurse,August 2012," my 330 gets 27 on the highway at 70. my 2000 vette would get 27-29 on the highway, got to love a v8 that lops along at 1500 at 70 mph..partners nissan gets 26 on highwayneighbors 2007 bmw gets 27 on the highway, this is doing 65. "
flightnurse,August 2012," infiniti has issues with the real world mpg of their car, a friend had a bmw5, he traded in a bmw 530i for it, loved the car, had the mpg, the best he got on road trips was 23 on the highway.. he would get 27 with the 530i.. even today the g and m do not deliver very good mpg. "
habitat1,August 2012," got to love a v8 that lops along at 1500 at 70 mph.no thanks, and no offense, but the chevrolet is, in many ways for me, the epitome of gms screwed up engineering. it takes them twice as many liters of displacement to get the same power as porsche or ferrari, then they throw in a transmission that has to be downshifted into 4th gear to achieve terminal velohonda? and, just so they dont get hit with a gas guzzler tax, they make that super tall 6th gear feel like you are lugging a locomotive? i was happy getting 27+ mpg at 70 mph at 2,500 rpm in 6th gear in my old 911 without having to play games with gear ratios. "
sweendogy,August 2012," would have to say that statement for me could be the complete opposite on how i look at chevrolet at all. twice as many liters, gearing (downshift) who cares you can get a vette for a third of the price if you are going to compaire them with porsche and the italians. bad argument on so many levels - if you are going to bash gm the chevrolet is the wrong car to use as a reference. enjoy the 911 and stick to talking about poor mpgs in the acura "
hclll,August 2012," hi guys i am looking at the audi audi but i feel like i have to sit pretty low to get enough headroom without reclinging the seatback too much. i had 2 bmw 5 series and test drove a new f30 3 series they all seem to have bigger headroom than audi. just wonder if you guys experienced the same, or it was my false impression.... "
billyperksii,August 2012," i have a friend at work who has the 2009 audi-he is about 5""10"", honestly, he looks like mr.incredible driving the audi.literally he looks as if he is bending his neck to see the road and this is no exaggeration. "
nyccarguy,August 2012," i posted about a friend of mine in south fla who had a nice audi 3.2 s-line that was totalled by either a large puddle or brilliant volkswagen engineering. he originally started out looking for a cpo infiniti sedan. after speaking to him and raving about my 328xi, he decided to add a cpo bmw sport pkg to his short ltoyota. he was disappointed by the high asking prices of 09s & many dealers unwilling to budge off their asking prices. he got 1 place to come down $1000, but that was still over $4k over auction value. a dealer called him back and told him of a 2011 bmw sport auto. the car is a 2011 saphire black/black bmw sedan w/ sport, premium, cold weather, navigation, automatic... executive demo w/ 7,000 miles on it. msrp of over $52k. he paid $37,500 + ttl. my friend has quickly forgotten about his beloved audi. i hear the excitement in his voice when he tells me how much he loves everything about his bmw. "
fedlawman,August 2012, your friend got a very good deal! 
nyccarguy,August 2012," he really did get a fantastic deal. over $14,000 off sticker for a car with 7,000 miles. he even called 2 other dealers to see if they had any 2011 executive demos & they both told him to take the deal he was offered. he essentially paid what i paid (the capitalized cost of my lease) for my 328xi.he had looked at a few 09s. a dealer had one with 15k miles and was asking $35k. another dealer had an 09 with 32k miles ltoyotaed for $31k. "
stickguy,August 2012," wonder if south florida, august, and black over black had anything to do with it? "
hclll,August 2012," i am 62 and have a longer torso, so it would be a problem to find a toyotaable driving position in the new audi right? also did u guys notice the audi dashboard is kinda of high, not like bmw that is low in the sight? "
habitat1,August 2012," thats a good deal - but it also reminds me that i need to collect my ""finders fee"" from my friend that i referred to bmw of towson. they had a brand new (not demo) bmw 6-speed manual, sport package, etc. etc. with a sticker of $60,000+. they had it ltoyotaed on their website as a ""special"" for several months at $50,900. i told him to hand them a check for $45k and dare them to rip it up. they did the deal in late june at $45,500.unfortunately, towson didnt have any remaining allocations for build to order 2012 x5ds, so i had to order ours from another dealer. but the sales manager was pretty good natured about it - toyota i can always come in and buy something from their stoyotaer porsche dealer at $5,000 over msrp to make up for the loss they took on my ""hardball"" friend.reaffirms my belief that there are always good deals out there if you are willing to shop around.. "
habitat1,August 2012," i have a friend who is 64"", 210+/- and he drives an 2011 audi. loves it. i would have thought the audi would provide similar head and leg room, but maybe not. you might want to go back and re-check for yourself. "
fedlawman,August 2012," ""reaffirms my belief that there are always good deals out there if you are willing to shop around..""especially if youre not in a hurry, willing to walk away, drive 400 miles, and/or settle for options/colors that arent your first (or even third) choice. "
ivan_99,August 2012," you really need to check it out. some people prefer a upright position, some like to lean back.im a similar height and i fit fine in any of the audi from 1996 to the current one. "
stickguy,August 2012, i was fine with your first 3 conditions. my wife violently objected to the last one (options/colors!) 
fedlawman,August 2012," yup, thats usually how it is... "
habitat1,August 2012," yup, thats usually how it is...but....i dont think you need to (or should) go as far as to ""settle"" for your third (or worse) choice of color and options if you plan ahead and are willing to do the other three things.acura makes it easy. limited ""trim"" choices and color choices with almost no options to begin with. find a dealer with a big inventory that has great deals. other brands, with long option ltoyota, are a little tougher. but, my recent experience with bmw proved to me that custom ordering from a dealer - which i always assumed meant paying a higher price than taking a car off the lot - may in fact produce the best results, long term. we had to shop around to a dozen or more dealers to find one that still had allocation spots for a 2012 x5d, but in the end, found one willing to negotiate a price that was within a few hundred (compared to invoice) of the best deal we could have gotten for a ""leftover"" vehicle on the lot. but, by ordering to our exact specs, we also didnt get stuck with a few options we didnt want, which ended up putting us ahead in the end.if and when i get another ""fun"" car, i will in all likelihood order a porsche rather than take one of the lot. trying to find my color and option preferences, given the ridiculous ltoyota of choices from porsche, is a near fruitless exercise. and id rather shop around for a dealer willing to give me a 6-7% discount on a custom order than compromise my preferences to take a car off the lot (like i did in 2005) at a 11% discount, but one that had a lot of options that i didnt want and didnt have a couple that i now know i would like. a friend of mine who used to work for audi (corporate, not dealer) indicated that, even though audi is achieving record sales and many dealerships are low on inventory, you can still order one at or below invoice due to incentives and their desire to continue to increase sales vs. bmw and mercedes. there is a saying in my business (real estate development) that a great deal on a fair property is not as good as a fair deal on a great property. for my friend that got lucky with a bmw manual transmission, he got the best of both worlds. but for most of us, i think id rather shop really hard for the car i wanted, and not be stuck with my third or fourth choice color and the wrong options for the next 6-7-8+ years. "
graphicguy,August 2012," hclll....most of the regulars here already know what i own. but, i drive an 11 bmw coupe, while the girlfriend drives an audi s4 (majorly juiced audi). im 510"" and 190 lbs. the girlfriend is 53"" and about 125 lbs. i actually find her audi to be more toyotaable and easier to see out of than my bmw. she drives my car as much as she drives her car (and vice nissan). ive never heard her complain either way....although, im glad both car have memory seat. "
flightnurse,August 2012," the v8 in the vette i own as well as current vettes are what makes the car. not too sure what you mean by, play games with the gear ratios? drop it down to 3rd, and watch most car disappear in the rear view mirror. remember, hondaing to some, only real car enthusiasts gets manuals! i really liked my vette, however, mine must have been a monday car, as it wasnt screwed together very well...

billyperksii,August 2012," i am coverting my fog lights to hid and i wanted to know if i need""relay harness"" to do this?i ordered the kit yesterday so i am still in the dark about these relays.remember, this is for a 2009 tl awd. "
stickguy,August 2012," being able to wait should eliminate the settling issue.the internet makes it real easy to shop around. in a fe minutes, i found the dealer that seems to be hoarding all the ones we want (first choice color and interior). they have 3, no one else seems to have any! but, they are about 2 hours away.so my choice now is, take a ride, or just wait for a local dealer to get one.of course, the far away guy is also way lower on price. "
habitat1,August 2012," what i meant was that, in order to achieve respectable epa highway ratings for the chevrolet, gm made the final (two, i believe) gear ratios so tall that they are effectively idling at 65 mph and dont play any part in the use of the car as a sports car - i.e. what you basically have is a 4-speed manual with 2 overdrive gears. and that, for a variety of reasons, just doesnt appeal to me as something i would ever claim was great engineering. at least when porsche decides to add a tall highway ratio like they did this year, they put it in as a 7th speed and leave the first 6 as before and perfectly matched to the engine output.i dont want to turn this into a gm bashing string, but heres what i see when i look at ""precision engineering"":z06 chevrolet vs. 911s7.0 liters vs. 3.8 liters505 hp vs. 400 hp470 ft.lbs vs. 325 ft.lbs15/24 epa vs. 18/27 epaslower vs. faster acceleration (to 60-100)slower vs. faster around ""the ring""higher vs. lower top speed (in 4th vs. 6th)$76,000 vs. $96,000you can essentially do the same comparison for the zsubaru vs. 911 turbo. i dont dispute that the chevrolet is a lot of raw performance for the money. i just think that it appeals to those that prefer ""raw"" to refined. everything is done by increasing the quantity - engine size, tire size, etc. and they still fall short of the 911 on everything that matters to me for a nimble handling high performance sports car. the fact that a 911s or turbo costs $20-30k more than the comparable chevrolet model may make them ""expensive"" to some, but id rather have the ""cheap"" 911s than the $15k more expensive zsubaru any day. im not going to be too disappointed that i am a few tenths slower in the quarter mile or a few mph short in top speed. at least i will have a car engineered to get the absolute most out of less, and is ""screwed together"" very well. (something that i am also going to consider when i cast my presidential vote this fall).  "
sweendogy,August 2012," ""no thanks, and no offense, but the chevrolet is, in many ways for me, the epitome of gms screwed up engineering. ""sounds like a ringing endorcement for the brand to me..while i agree the higher (""expensive"") priced 911 is a better all around car-- its still considerably more ""expensive""- couple of questions- i see you used a select use of comparion data- why the select group, ie no 0-60?.. other question is the """" around expensive- whats that supposed to mean?? a 25% premium (w/o options) from one car to the other, when comparing such car seems regular, no """" expensive to me "
habitat1,August 2012," i was making reference to 0-60 in my ""faster acceleration to 60 and on up to 100+/-"" i know you are a stickler for hard data, but to be honest, im going off of memory of comparison tests by r&t, c&d, etc, whereby the chevrolet had considerably difficulty starting from a standstill without spinning its wheels. i do know the new 911s has been independently tested at 3.7 seconds to 60, but would have to do some research to get a reference. same is true for the turbo, which at 2.8+/- was the second fastest (0.1 behind the veyron) ever tested. not that any of this matters to me personally. anything under about 4.5 is more than i need or care to pay for.which brings me to the ""expensive"" quotes. i respect that for some people, $75k is expensive and for others $135k isnt so much so, compared to the $2 million plane they are eyeballing. i am a heck of a lot closer to the former than the latter. but for me, a $96k 911s (the cheaper porsche) would be far more rewarding to drive and own than the $110k zsubaru (most expensive chevrolet). hell, knock the ""s"" off the 911 and save another $12k and it wouldnt change my mind. i just dont find the gm engineering of the chevrolet is particularly inspiring or compelling. not that im a german snob and dont think the u.s. is capable of it - in fact, i have a deposit on a tesla model s and may very well be driving my first american car in 25+ years by next february. "
sweendogy,August 2012," ""i have a deposit on a tesla model s and may very well be driving my first american car in 25+ years by next february. ""that being toyota, what are you doing in the ellps chat talking mpgs in the acura?please limit the use of quotes in your response  "
flightnurse,September 2012," the interesting thing about the vette v 911 is the person who is shopping a vette isnt shopping for a 911, they are completely different car. the vette rings america, big v8, baritone exhaust tone, flat torque curve. now while the vette is ""idling"" at 65 the car does pick up speed nicely while in 6th gear.your argument is interesting, however, one needs to remember, when cruising along the highway, why does the car need to be revving at 3k. the owner just has to go down to 3rd gear and be gone.. not a hard thing to do. price a base model vette can be had for 45k, while the base price 911 is 86k. not too sure if the extra money is worth the extra performance. "
flightnurse,September 2012," after months of looking and driving and fretting over a car, my partner finally decided on one. now, its not a bmw, or audi, or mb nor is it a infiniti. however, the infiniti m was scratched off his ltoyota very early. after an interesting week in charlotte on my way home (have to love wifi while flying) my partner tells me he finally chosen a car and will tell me about it after he picks me up at the airport. so for the next 3 hours i was trying to figure out what it was, so upon arriving in phoenix i narrowed it down to 3, hyundai hyundai 3.8, ford ford (eco boost 2.0l, 2013) and lastly volkswagen passt se tdi. not too sure why i thought the hyundai but i did.. after getting my check bagged, i meet him at the usual spot on on the north side arrival by entrance 8. he is hungry, im not, had a good dinner on the flight but went out anyhow. so after a few connissantion about things that happened with both us, i told which car he decided on... i get this look and reaction, ""how in the hell did you know..."" i laughed, but wasnt too sure which one, but had to guess again, so i went with the hyundai, hyundai, turned out not to be the v6, but the v8 4.6. so at dinner he explained why he went with it and it all makes sense.... he loves car, but not in the same sense as i do, he doesnt drive his car hard at all...msrp, $45,798, sale price $37,990, it is a 2012, white with cashmere leather interior, and for 2012 all 4.6l hyundai came fully loaded. granted it doesnt handle like a bmw, or have the ""bling"" of the mb or the style of audi, but what it does have is value... we picked the car up on sat, and drove up to prescott, az. have to save, was impressed with the dealership and how smoothly the transaction was and how the salesman went over every item on the car with rick. i was impressed with how it drove, seat are very toyotaable, and handled the mountain roads with no issue. my partner likes bmw and audi, but he couldnt justify the price of a 528 or audi and he doesnt tackle the round abouts (or jug handles as they are called in jersey) like i do, but he wanted all the luxury and room in the back seat for his clients. so the out the door price was just little over $40k, not too sure how anyone could pass up this deal (yes i know some of you would without thinking twice.) the same dealer has a couple of hyundai they had one on the showroom, msrp $61,000, sale price $50k... "
sweendogy,September 2012, good stuff- who would of thought a korean auto maker could be cross shopped against the germans and gain a sale- huge strides for the company as a whole - enjoy the rig 
habitat1,September 2012," interesting, my marketing director is seriously considering the hyundai as a replacement for her mercedes. her priority is luxury and space, as she often is driving clients around and, hondaing to her, the hyundai has a back seat that is closer to an s class than an e class in size and toyota. her husband, a retired navy honda and much more of a driving enthusiast, couldnt be pried out of his older generation bmw with a crowbar. when he drove the hyundai, he picked it apart relative handling, braking and precision relative to the german alternatives. but shes looking at the toyota, space and value - and willing to give hyundai a chance. plus the dealer is willing to give her the car for an entire week to test drive. my guess is that the hyundai will get a few more infiniti and lexus buyers to consider it than audi or bmw buyers, but either way, hyundai has come a long way since those shaky early years. "
flightnurse,September 2012," as i posted my partner looks at value first and foremost., this is his car, now if i had a say, the car of choice would have been a 550i, and i would have made up the difference for him. one thing people need to remember is, when infiniti and lexus hit our shores, the mindset was the same, who would shop a japanese car and mb... "
nyccarguy,September 2012," congrats on the new ride! best of luck to you with it! a v8, rwd, sedan for $40k is a good deal! keep us informed of how you like it! "
flightnurse,September 2012," while at the dealership picking up the car, i sat in the hyundai and the first thing that came to my mind was, space, front seat and backseat has lots of it. after speaking to a salesmen for the hyundai (not all hyundai salesmen can sell the hyundai) hyundai brought that car over here to show that it is serious about luxury car. in korea people who have them have a driver, the owner doesnt drive them. it is an interesting car..for the money, the hyundai have plenty of room in the back (more then an e class) and has all the bells and whtoyotales then a base e class has. so far reliability hasnt been a problem for either car which is something that mb and at times bmw can not say. so it should be interesting to see how well this car holds up. "
wireless,September 2012," the edgy-cool styling of the hyundai is starting to look a little dated. it is not classic styling that lasts but for a few years - often the problem with asian designs, more derivative than creative. good deals for the people who are into the moment and in that price range though. "
billyperksii,September 2012, not acura- they stand the test of time.  
flightnurse,September 2012," interesting, since the hyundai sedan arent edgy in design but very much conservative. "
flightnurse,September 2012," they gave him more on his trade in then i figured they would, so over all it was a great deal... "
robr2,September 2012," interesting, since the hyundai sedan arent edgy in design but very much conservative.i would presume wireless is referring to the hyundai. i have to agree. iirc, i posted elsewhere that the styling would be dated rather quickly.the issue with the edgy styling is that it needs refreshing more often. for instance the hyundai design language was updated for the hyundai and imho, the hyundai is a very handsome vehicle. "
flightnurse,September 2012," i knew what wireless was talking about however, he didnt mention that in his post.i agree i was taken how nice the hyundai was in person, i believe the hyundai wont get old looking too quickly and easy to update... "
habitat1,September 2012," billy, you are way too young to be an authority on ""the test of time"". i saw something that looked like my old 1987 acura acura on the road the other day and almost threw up. but our neighbor has a 1985 mb 300d that, in addition to refusing to die in spite of billowing black smoke at 400k miles, still doesnt look all that bad at only a few years younger than you. "
sweendogy,September 2012," not that my opinion means much- but i think the styling of the hyundai will hold up well after the years pass. its got styling from both lexus and mb. its understated yet elegant - love the looks of the exterior - the interior specifically the shifter and nav look a little dated already but from the outside this car is a nice looker- flight you should of talked your partner into getting a ""r"" type. all in all a great value "
sweendogy,September 2012," on the company website it looks like they hondalined the line a bit - 2012 had 5 options, 2013 only 2 with the 3.8 and the grand daddy 5.0 r type. wonder if the other options will be added late- or gone forever "
flightnurse,September 2012," the dealer didnt have any spec rs and i doubt he would have gone for it if they did. i drove the car to tuscon to see a client, cruise was set at 75, i averaged 25.6 mpg, on a very green engine. epa rates the car at 26 on the highway. "
habitat1,September 2012," say it aint so.....cruise control on a green engine????not sure what hyundai told you, but on all of my past four new car (acura, acura, porsche and bmw) that was the one constoyotaent thing that everybody toyota (and was in the owners manual): do not use cruise control in the first 1,000 miles and if you have a long highway drive, vary the speed and engine rpms. my friend with the bmw manual is also a mechanical/nuclear engineer and gave me his interpretation as to why it is critically important that engine parts run at different speeds so as not to have single points of contact during early break in. my non-stop 510 mile trip back from spartanburg in our new x5d was a test of discipline not to use cruise, but i varied the speeds between 60 and 80 and still averaged 29.4 mpg. you may want to check the owners manual on the hyundai, but id be surprised if whats being recommended for everything else wouldnt also apply to it. "
robr2,September 2012, ...cadillac ats at the dealer. 3.6l performance awd with every box ticked for options. it stickered at over $54k. a fellow sports dad is the sales manager at the dealer and he showed it to me. he hadnt driven it yet but his sales people had and it was a rocket.he toyota they ordered this first one with everything to show folks what is offered. he expected some entry priced units shortly. i asked him to order a turbo standard with the 6 speed so i could try it but he smiled and asked for a deposit. he knows the 7 of us who want a stick will probably order one!! 
billyperksii,September 2012," not too young- look around next time, even the acura look sturdy as well as the 1st generation tl- i guess it depends on the owner, my tl turned 3 years this past august (and strangers tell me they think its a new car)and i see the exact tls at the dealer getting oil changes looking pretty beat up. "
nyccarguy,September 2012," while im sure that ats looked nice, at $54k? no thank-you. it might find a buyer with $12k off sticker + 0% for 60 months + scheduled maintenance included during a gm ""red tag sale event."" "
billyperksii,September 2012, or shell out 2k grand more and get an audi prestige (with some haggling involved).ats for 54k- thats some serious price overlap. 
fedlawman,September 2012," i just built an ats (2.0l turbo) with 6-speed mt, moonroof, and heated seat for an msrp of $36,000. thats $2500 less than a similarly equipped bmw.270 hp, 33xx lb curb weight, and dimensions almost exactly the same as the 3 series. impressive - im looking forward to seeing and driving one. "
sweendogy,September 2012," lawman i havent priced it out but if thats the case 2500 bux is a huge nut- wait 6 months and with discounts your prob over 5k in savings.. i havent read enuf about the car to truly honda my interest, but the commercials are cool - plus only one caddy dealer i know up here i think still has a few new cinerons on the lot as 1988 leftovers "
habitat1,September 2012," i am unmazdar with the ats, but....you might want to consider resale value before you reach any conclusion as to whether it is a good deal compared to a bmw. in my area at least, a 3-4-5 year old used cadillac has almost no market appeal compared to a well maintained bmw. so, unless you are planning to keep one for 8+ years such that resale value isnt a significant factor, i think the $2,500 savings up front would translate into a huge negative difference in resale in 3-4 years. perhaps its different in other parts of the country, but thats the way it is in the dc area. "
nyccarguy,September 2012," habitat - while that is true & i have the utmost respect for your knowledge & opinions, i buy car for me & not the next guy. theres always some excuse that the dealer comes up with at trade in time anyway. when i traded my black/black 2010 acura tech (49,000 miles) back in march, i got $19,000 for it. now acura are supposed to have high resale value, my car was a desirable color combo, had the tech pkg (nav, backup camera, upgraded stereo...), was a 4 cyl (good on gas), automatic, 8/10 exterior, 9/10 interior... i had a dealer offer me $16k (thats 50% depreciation in 2 years). he told me there was an 80 day supply of acura. when i told him that only 4 had crossed the auction block with tech pkg, he fired back that the nav wasnt that desirable. "
graphicguy,September 2012," fn....congratz to your partner, ive driven the hyundai a couple of times. the v8 was very impressive given the price. nice deal, too! "
flightnurse,September 2012," i had to watch my speed, i caught myself doing 95, the dps (highway patrol) really patrol i-10 between casa grande and tuscon. the car isnt breaking a sweet at 95... im sure the owners manual doesnt recommends using the cruise either, "
flightnurse,September 2012," hey graphic thanks, he is very proud of it, he had his first clients in the car, the couple have a new 2013 e350. at first the husband wasnt too sure what car rick had, at the end of the tour, the husband asked rick, the husband was impressed, as the husband told rick he has owned a mb for the last 25 years. i think he made the right choice... "
flightnurse,September 2012," the acura was a lesson learned by acrua... stupid name, and it looked too much like an honda on the inside, and the interior screamed honda.... "
habitat1,September 2012," nyc, havent checked ktoyota or other sources, but $19k for a 2010 acura with 49,000 miles doesnt seem terrible, given that acura is discounting the heck out of their new car now. i just got another e-mail from pohanka acura indicating they would give me $9,300 of a brand new 2012 tl sh-awd (manual or auto), which works out to around $36k. i have to believe that acura aggressive pricing on new car would affect resale values of 2-3 year old, higher mileage ones. a used acura tech for $20k such as yours looks pretty good when a new tl awd tech is ltoyotaed at $44k. not so much when the tl can actually be bought for $36-37k. not sure what the situation was in march.but i still think acura and bmw hold their value much better than cadillacs in our area. i fully concur with you that you should buy a car for yourself and not the next guy, but for others that were comparing vehicles and looking at a $2-4k difference in price up front (only 5-10%), considering resale may help justify (or not) the initial price difference. and or those that dont care about resale because they might keep the car for 6-8 years, i think its also worth checking out older versions of what they are considering and see how they hold up. just yesterday, a friend of mine picked me up in his 2002 mercedes c320 with 190,000 miles. it looks and drives like its just nicely broken in. he mentioned that his wifes cadillac, after 4 years and 50,000 miles shows much more age with rattles, uneven leather wear, chrome pitting on the grill, etc. they bought the cadillac in 2008 as a result of getting what looked like a great deal compared to a mercedes. now, they are likely to give all of the savings back on a miserable trade in for a new gl. "
robr2,September 2012," while im sure that ats looked nice, at $54k? no thank-you. i agree that $54k is a bit of a stretch for the ats but you can option out a 3 series to almost $60k. im going to say that the ats will do very well in the $35-40k price rangethe enthusiast mags are already saying the 3 has some serious competition in terms of driving toyotamics. but the badge snobs will still flock to the 3 because of the roundel. personally im not interested in driving what my neighbors 25 yo live at home kid is leasing. i like to be noticed in something different. "
flightnurse,September 2012," rob, the magazines always say something like that when they arent doing a comparison, on their own each might be a great car, but once you get the competition together the faults of each car are easy to see. i hope the ats does well, competition only makes for a fun time and better products. "
flightnurse,September 2012," habitat- the escalate is just a chevrolet with bling, nothing extra was done to it and of course werent built very well, cant use that as a comparison to a german built car.the reason why we got the hyundai at the price is the 2013 are rolling in, end of year, all manufactures are doing this, even bmw (with the 5 series). currently here in phoenix, bmw is offering $4500 off options (not too sure which option package they are referring to) plus $3k. "
nyccarguy,September 2012," and i agree with you that a mid to high $50 something thousand dollar 3 series is absurd as well. much of the 3s ""advantages"" may be gone as well due to electric power steering & suspension softening.while it is true that 328xis are everywhere, especially silver ones like mine, the e90 is still an absolute blast to drive. i welcome the competition as well. the ats looks nice, the next is should be more competitive, the next g will probably make all of us bmw nuts think twice before a return trip to our local dealer.when my lease is up in 2 years, i dont think ill be shopping in this ellps category anyway. "
robr2,September 2012," rob, the magazines always say something like that when they arent doing a comparison, on their own each might be a great car, but once you get the competition together the faults of each car are easy to see. i hope the ats does well, competition only makes for a fun time and better products.youre right - until the 2 are compared side by side, its all speculation. but if the worshipers of the temple of bmw say it has a chance...i too look forward to some competition for the 3 series. its a great car but imho getting a little soft. "
habitat1,September 2012," i too look forward to some competition for the 3 series. its a great car but imho getting a little soft.or....is it just that the 3 series has gotten too big? the current 3 series nearly as big (and heavy) as the 5 series from a few generations ago. and the current 5 is nearly as big as the 7 series was a few generations ago. want small and nimble, a little one series, that seems tiny by todays standards, is not much smaller than a 1990 vintage 3 series. the 3 series can still be made to be tight, as was proven to me as i rode in the backseat of a 4-door bmw being driven by a bmw instructor at their track last week. but look at the relatively low percentage of bmw that are equipped with manual transmissions today, let alone sport packages and suspensions. i dont think bmw has gotten soft by their own preference - rather its more the result of their objective to increase sales and, as such, having to cater to a lower common denominator when it comes to american buyers. frankly, i wish theyd just tell the softee buyers to pound salt and buy a lexus. but then again, im not a bmw shareholder. "
flightnurse,September 2012," i do hope the ats is as good as what cadillac has been saying in their commercials, however, htoyotaory has proven that they have been short every time... im looking forward in driving a ats and cadillac, once national rental car gets them in, next week im back in detroit so im hoping they have gotten the cadillac. "
robr2,September 2012," i do hope the ats is as good as what cadillac has been saying in their commercials, however, htoyotaory has proven that they have been short every time...im more interested in what the reviewers say as they get the most seat time in every car.as for what cadillac says in the ads....ive never seen any advertiser say ""hey our product is mediocre."" "
billyperksii,September 2012, yeah right 
ivan_99,September 2012, unless youre the mitsubishi australian ceoi dont know why people buy a mitsubishi...what is the benefit? 
flightnurse,September 2012, bill did u own a acura when it was new? 
flightnurse,September 2012," rob, im talking about htoyotaory, and even on cadillac web page they say it is better then a 3 series... i just hope that htoyotaory doesnt repeat itself. "
billyperksii,September 2012," why is this directed at me ivan?fwiw, i agree with the australian ceo. "
billyperksii,September 2012," i think i was still in high school but my older brother best friend had one and it was one sweet ride back then. additionally, those name (acura and ledgend) catapulted the acura brand. my stoyotaers husband bought the ledgend and that car was the talk of the town, i was aspiring to buy one. "
ivan_99,September 2012," just because you agreed to the statement ""as for what cadillac says in the ads....ive never seen any advertiser say ""hey our product is mediocre.""so i thought id point out where an employee (the top) made a public statement (which is sort of like an advertisement) saying their product was mediocre.btw...me too (agreeing with the ceo)  "
sweendogy,September 2012," acura, acura and acura - i agree totally made the brand ""pop"" certainly where i grew up in the urban jungle. (nissan another car, ) now they have the acura tl-shawd advance package and a blump grill - "
wireless,September 2012, and they did away with names as numbers sound more prestigious... like the german makes. 
kyfdx,September 2012," we leased a acura in 1994... the last year... a loaded gs model.. it was my wifes car and we really liked it.. stickered for right around $29k5-cylinder, 172 hp... weak subaru34 a/c.. killer lease deal (my first lease)..my aunt bought a new acura in 1992... which is now sitting in my driveway.. 43k miles!! original msrp was $32,500.. "
habitat1,September 2012," a buddy of mine bought a acura gs 6-speed manual sometime around 1994. pretty interesting that bmw and porsche (i believe) were still using 5-speed manuals at the time. granted, it was still fwd, but for acura, that may have been the pinnacle of their attempt to challenge the bmw as the sport sedan leader. "
kyfdx,September 2012," i think in 1994, acura was probably kicking bmw butt... at least in sales...e34s werent the most loved model that bmw ever came out with... and, then.. they had the nikasil issues with the v-8 engines.. "
benjaminh,September 2012," so are you saying you have a 1992 acura with 43,000 original miles. wow. i really liked that generation of acura. very nice looking car, and clearly very well engineered. i still think it was a mtoyotaake to drop the acura name, but obviously thats water thats been under the bridge for something like 15 years... "
flightnurse,September 2012," what built acura was the acura and acura and the total dealer experience, not the acura (the car was around for 2 or 3 yrs), again the name was stupid. i had a roommate at the time have one (bought new), and every time he drove me to the airport i swear i was in an honda.... now my roommates brother in law at a acura ls which i thought was a nice car. "
habitat1,September 2012," if im not mtoyotaaken, even the original acura was built upon an honda platform - or some vhondation of it. the acura was definitely based upon the honda. part of the problem/dilemma with acura over the years is that they have not put enough dtoyotaance between themselves and honda in the engineering and product positioning of their vehicles. both lexus and infiniti put a much bigger gap between themselves and their respective roots. acura stuck with honda based fwd and v6s, even in their top of the line car; and as a result has had to fight the perception that the acura, acura, tl and even rl were simply gussied up honda. it wasnt until the 2007 acura that it wasnt simply a well equipped, face-lifted honda. lexus had that problem with the es - a gussied up toyota - but the gs and ls had no toyota counterpart and were made in japan. the early g20 was a nissan based car, but at least eventually evolved into its own identity with rwd. the m and q were non-nissan.the good news for acura is that honda is a better starting point than nissan and toyota, in my opinion. but they seemed to have bi-polar disorder in trying to establish a true luxury division and then chickening out when it came to competing with bmw and mercedes. they could have, imo.off subject, the best engineered car, dollar for dollar, i have ever owned was my 2002 honda s2000. rwd, 120hp/liter without turbos, as tight of a suspension as a porsche. i just wish they had more balls to put some of their engineering prowess into something that competed with a 550i 6-speed manual. or, just introduce a honda s3000 so i have something to consider before i buy another porsche. the upcoming honda is over the top in styltoyotaic craziness and will, i predict, be a non-event. the s2000 was revolutionary and forced porsche to improve their boxster. but i digress... "
flightnurse,September 2012," the acura was a result of a joint toyota with britains austin rover group called project xx that started in november 1981 with the austin rover-honda xx letter of intent signed by the two companies to replace the rover sd1 and to provide a luxury vehicle for honda. (""acura acura"", 15 august 2012 at 23:46.). so hondaing to this, the acura was not an honda in any way which is what i thought.yes, the acura was based on the honda.acura acura.

flightnurse,September 2012," once again the acura was an honda...the honda acura is a compact sedan sold in japan from 1981 to 1995. it was sold in north america from 1992 to 1994 as the acura acura, a mid-size luxury car. the acura started out in japan only in the early 1980s as a luxury level honda, and as such was honda flagship sedan until the arrival of the honda acura. acura acura.

ivan_99,September 2012, very true...which is why in europe they sold the honda honda :shades: 
fedlawman,September 2012," ooh, did you say ""sterling?"" :p "
flightnurse,September 2012," yup, i remember the sterlings 825 better styling then the acura, but for some reason wasnt as reliable as the acura. i really like the 5 door that was produced. my room mate who had the acura, his brother in law bought a 5 door sterling, then later on bought a acura. "
flightnurse,September 2012," this is true, but the dealer experience is what set them apart from the honda dealers too. even today there is a big difference between the acura dealer and the honda dealer, in regards to attitude.. "
alltorque,September 2012," the rover 820 and 825 were very popular over here in uk but the 820 was considered the better, (2.0ltr i4), as the 825 engine only came into its own at higher revs, which most owners didnt use. the later 827 improved the situation but not enough.we still get honda acura over here too. last one i saw was last year, (maybe longer), on a dealers forecourt. 10 miles on the clock and a price reduced by just 50%, yes 50% ! salesman toyota he was prepared to haggle and would let it go if he could show a ?100 profit. not terribly popular, (3,5 ltr v6), but a wonderful piece of engineering. last one i saw on the road was a friends in austria, three years ago. superb ride but thirsty. "
flightnurse,September 2012, here in the states we got the 825 and 827sl. 
billyperksii,September 2012," ""now they have the acura tl-shawd advance package and a blump grill -""waaay better car than a pontiac5- imho. "
flightnurse,September 2012," ""now they have the acura tl-shawd advance package and a blump grill -"" waaay better car than a pontiac5- imho.i hope so since infiniti has updated the pontiac5 with the infiniti... how much better is the tl- sh awd w/ advance package over say a fully loaded infiniti? "
andys120,September 2012," this topic is getting boring. all we ever seem to talk about is acura, whats up with that? the real ellpcs dont get much discussion. i posted my impressions of the f30 bmw and nobody had much to say or ask.my brother told me he thought he might look at an acura to replace his honda. i told him to check out infiniti.  "
billyperksii,September 2012," same old noisy v6 with 2 extra gears. sweeny dont start, you know my partiality towards the tl. "
sweendogy,September 2012," one mans noise is another mans symphonythe nissan work horse v6 - knock it for being brash but it brings the goods when needed- i took a 400mile rd trip all highway over the weekend 23.5 mpg nothing to write home about - but at 32500 miles the 5 year old was smooth and soft when needed. . i like everything thing the tl awd brings to the table - overall a great package - and awd with stick is cool, plus he 9k off people have been talking about this car is a stud given discounted price.- but take all the car in this class - put them side by side and on looks alone it would lose vs ever car in this class- the dealers were painting the factory grill - there are websites where you can get a replacement grill- and honda had to reduce the nose in short order to get car to move off the lots. "
jpp75,September 2012," i agree, the ats might be a great car but cadillac has a long way to go before they can command that kind of price. "
flightnurse,September 2012," not too sure about that, the vq v6 has to be one of the nicest v6 made, and it has won many awards.but the best 6 cyl is the one bmw makes, well balanced, built to last and sings to red line. "
flightnurse,September 2012," i took a 400mile rd trip all highway over the weekend 23.5 mpg nothing to write home aboutthis is whats going to kill infiniti, they have to get that engine to stop drinking fuel.... hell a bmw 740i is rated at 28 on the highway, and the car is much heavier then your pontiac5.... "
cdnpinhead,September 2012," this topic is getting boring. all we ever seem to talk about is acura, whats up with that? the real ellpcs dont get much discussion.this board was deader than elvis for months, if not years, until a couple of people made it their own personal playground. a few worthy posts slip in from time to time (like yours), so i continue to follow it. i found the f30 review interesting, but since i dont own one or have any plans to buy or drive one, didnt respond. "
flightnurse,September 2012," forums have a way of changing over time, and with the crop of new car coming into the ellps maybe the that are talked about here should be expanded. this board has a wide range of likes and dislikes and a very wide idea on what a ellps is, what i dont like are the personal attacks and how people continue to beat a dead horse and cant move forward. but humans do come in all shapes, sizes and personalities. when it comes to driving the new f30 car, the bmw w/ the 8 spd auto is a good combo. was at the bmw dealer on friday, my niece wanted to buy a used bmw, and a local dealer had a cream puff, 2009 329i, jet black, oyster leather (great combo, no wear marks on the seat) premium, sport and cold weather package, xenon head lights, power rear shade, sat radio, toyota access, ipod/usb port. 46k miles, cpo and the dealer was asking $25,777. we couldnt get the numbers to work, and left, but i figured the dealer would call her, and they did, so on sat we went back, she was about to get the car for $24,100 + tax and fees. i drove a 2012 x3, i28, have to say was impressed, much larger then the last x3 i drove (2009) and the turbo 4 and 8 spd auto is a good combo, the transmission always seemed to be in the right gear when driving around town and one would be hard pressed to know it was a turbo...the x1 is a joke, about the same size as a honda and nissan for 39k, i assumed the x1 has the same 8 spd auto as the x3 and 328s have but they do not, they have a 6 spd... wonder why, cost ??while the finance department was getting my nieces paperwork together, i was talking with the sales manager and asked him how many bmw does the dealership order with the m sport package? (this was a different dealer than where i bought my 328 from) and the number was surprising.... he told me 1 in 800. the people who are buying bmw today arent really the sport people and they are looking for the luxury of the car not the sportiness of the car. i was basically told, if i wanted a 3 or 5 series with the m sport package, i would have to order the car, since he wouldnt order one for the dealership. in fact over the last 5 years the amount of bmw with the sport package has decreased, people dont like the sport seat.... basically bmw is going soft because the market demands it.... pretty sad....so my niece is very happy with her new bmw, she got a great car and it still has some of the factory 4yr/50k maintenance warranty left and she got the 6yr 100k mile warranty... knowing my niece she will drive it pretty close to the 100k mark in that amount of time. "
habitat1,September 2012," there seems to be a theme here that more gears is better. i disagree. ranking the transmission options in a bmw, id put it at:#1: 6-speed manual#2: 7-speed dual clutch automatic (""auto-manual"")#3: 8-speed steptronic (torque converter ""slush box"")even the suggestion that an 8-speed steptronic is better than a 6-speed is a little questionable. i recall when bmw responded to lexus introduction of 8-speed autos with the counter that bmw engine torque bands were wide enough that they didnt want to add more gears to have the car fishing for the right one at a particular speed. is the current 8-speed steptronic a response to the epa in trying to eek an extra mpg out of the engine? just like the not so popular start stop feature. the 6-speed auto in our x5d has no trouble producing 30 mpg on the highway and accelerating like a (big) v8 from 50 to 80. i can see where the lower torque 3.5i might benefit with 2 extra gears, but the x5d doesnt need them. whats next, a 10-speed auto that has to shift 9 times to get you to a highway cruise? or worse, a cvt transmission with an ""infinite"" number of equivalent gear ratios? at least when porsche made their epa concession, it was by adding a 7th gear to their manual that was a pure overdrive. they left the first 6 ratios untouched. the engine redlines in 6th gear at 188 mph (top speed) and the ratios are perfectly matched to get every ounce of performance out of the engine. thats whats important. and should be to bmw. not playing a whos got more game with lexus. "
sweendogy,September 2012, agree- could a cvt head into the g and m? or will he engine change to mb in the next refresh- something has to break 
m6user,September 2012, the x1 gets an 8 speed auto on the turbo four and a 6 speed auto on the i35 6 cyl model. 
graphicguy,September 2012, be happy to talk about bmw bmw and audi s4 if you want..... :shades: 
rayainsw,September 2012, the &#145;best choice&#146; for me [ ymmv ] is #2 - the 7-speed dct in the bmw bmw i currently drive.i have driven several bmw 6-speed steptronics and one new 8-speed step [ in a 2012 bmw ] and except in very slow & stop traffic [ 0 &#150; 20 mph ] this transmission is a paragon of quick & precise gearchanges [ up & down ] with very well managed driveline shock.- rayno manual trans. for me anymore . . . 
habitat1,September 2012," this transmission is a paragon of quick & precise gearchanges [ up & down ] with very well managed driveline shock.fortunately, i can still say the same thing about my right hand and left foot. but thats a debate for another forum.  "
flightnurse,September 2012," im sure it has to do with the epa more than anything else, but the benefits of the 8 spd steptronic are three fold. one it helps with the epa figure and two it keeps the engine in the torque band and three more people buy bmw with autos then manuals. with that being toyota, the 8 spd works will with the turbo 4, i havent driven the turbo 6 with the 8 spd, but i would assume it would be a nice fit too.in regards to the 7 spd manual in the 911, im sure bmw will be moving to this soon to get their manual car into line with the epa too. i like the newer dct a lot, very quick shifting up and down, and no lag when shifted "
flightnurse,September 2012," sweeny the issue infiniti has, it is trying to one up bmw, and to do that it is doing it with more hp, and this comes at a cost. infiniti for some reason just can not get the fm platform to handle as well as the 3 series, it has all the right boxs checked to be a better car... infiniti will have to do something to get in line with the epa... i have a question some of you experts, does infiniti fall under nissan when it comes to the epa? i would suspect if it does, then infiniti will not worry about the mpg of the g or m for a while. "
flightnurse,September 2012," interesting i swear the window sticker toyota the 4 cyl had the 6 spd. either way just too small, and i was told that the x1 might take over for the 3 series wagon, i hope not... "
flightnurse,September 2012," i highly doubt you can shift your 911 faster then a dct. in regards to your x5d, the torque band if so flat that having a 8 spd auto would be very beneficial in aiding more mpg without sacrificing performance. "
habitat1,September 2012," should have clarified that in my ""rankings"":#1 6-speed manual#2 7-speed dct (m series, $2,900 option)#3 7-speed dct (non-m, $450 option)#4 8-speed automaticlets not confuse high end dcts in the bmw or porsches pdk in the 911 with the dct used by bmw in the standard 3/5 series. very different in terms of design, performance - and cost. $2,900 for the bmw, $4,000 for the pdk, $10,000 for ferrari. you arent going to get that level of engineering or construction by checking a $450 box with bmw or volkswagen.as for my manual shifting speed vs. a dct. thats not the issue. ill give up a tenth or two in the 0-60 (one shift) drag race in order to get the direct control and the engagement factor of driving the car. i understand thats a personal choice. im no butoyotaa watson, but i still play volkswagen from the tips of a 7,100 yard course because i want the full effect. i know i could score a few strokes better from the white tee box, but it wouldnt be as satisfying. it makes me laugh that some of my playing partners will spend $500 on a driver and then moan like babies when i suggest we play the black tees rather than the blues or whites. regarding the x5d, the flat torque curve is precisely why you dont need as many gears. every gear change results in energy loss. small, but a loss nonetheless. by the time you get to highway speeds, the final gear ratio is all that matters, not how many shifts it took to get there. around town, an extra gear or two might help, but a 5,300 pound curb weight is still the overriding factor. "
rayainsw,September 2012, ok - my choice is now #3.all other comments still apply.- rayhappy with the performance - and the cost.... 
flightnurse,September 2012," i hear what you are saying as before i was the one who would never get a car that didnt have an auto, but not too sure if it age and or wisdom or both, but give me a good dct over a manual...so in theory a cvt would be the best transmission since it does not have to shift so no energy is lost. even though we know that nissan is working overtime to perfect it, they have come a long way with the new generation nissan and infiniti jx, but to see a cvt in a true performance car, nissan has its work cut out for themselves. "
sweendogy,September 2012, i agree infiniti is doing it with hp- but its also doing it with price- real dollars that can pay for a boatload of gas and oil changes. 
flightnurse,September 2012," value only goes so far, lets take my partners hyundai, for 2012, the v8 came fully loaded, no options, and it ltoyotaed at $46k, priced paid was $39k (plus tax and fees). it is bigger than a e class and 5 series, but smaller than 7 series and s class. now how many people who bought a e class or 5 series crossed shopped the hyundai, maybe not many, but they should have, but because people wanted a e class or 5 series that is what they bought regardless of price, even though the hyundai was a better value..there is a point in which value can only take you so far, and i think infiniti is getting to that point with the g and m... "
habitat1,September 2012," infiniti will be cross shopped by some bmw and mercedes shoppers because although it may have some shortcomings, it is still generally considered a luxury brand. infiniti may need to be value priced because of the shortcomings, but not necessarily because of a downscale image. hyundai is not considered a luxury brand and must be very aggressive in its pricing to convince even a few e class buyers that a hyundai, coming from the makers of an hyundai, is worth a look. add to that, quite a few of the current e class/5 series demographic are old enough to remember early excels that were complete pieces of crap. a friend who bought one in the 1990s literally had the paint start peeling off the car inside of 3 years. hyundai has improved considerably from those early days, but it is still very challenging to have your bread and butter car selling for $15,000 to $19,000 and expect to get a lot of bmw/mercedes/audi cross shoppers into a showroom with a $40,000 hyundai or even more of a stretch $60,000 hyundai. even the mercedes dealer down the road has a separate area of the showroom for amg car so that someone shopping for a $100,000 cls63 doesnt have to rub elbows with someone shopping for a nice little $35,000 c250. besides image, there is another value factor that is a little hard to quantify at this point. the price of a bmw/mercedes can partly be rationalized by the belief from many decades of htoyotaory that in 8-10 years it will still be a good, solid luxury car. maybe not with the latest gadgets and do-dads, but certainly not ready for the junkyard. hyundai has a few decades to go before they will have any kind of similar subaru. in fact, most 8-10 year old hyundias are a direct contradiction to what they are now trying to position themselves at. "
flightnurse,September 2012," i agree with everything you stated, i dont think my post toyota other wise, however, infiniti can only be based as a value buy for a short time. im sure the next gen g, will help improve the short comings that the car has, but at a price, and we will see the price of the car go up. "
robbieg,September 2012," i dont see why infiniti can only be a value buy for a short time. i would think that they could and will continue to produce car that are close to a bmw and at a decent discount. i think this is cadillacs problem that they arent willing to accept the fact they are a ""value"" luxury car. i personally think a cadillac is on the same level as infiniti and less than audi, bmw, mercedes and lexus, and above acura. lincoln is a lost cause as far as i am concerned.another point, why does infiniti and cadillac put logos on some of their seat? "
sweendogy,September 2012," what is a short period of time- ? the pontiac5/37 is now in its 10th year, and 2 generations. im sure we will see a hike in price but dont you think infiniti knows its main draw is similar performance at a cheaper price- i mean its been doing it right for 10 plus years. "
m6user,September 2012," infiniti can only be based as a value buy for a short time.why? no, car will ever be exactly the same as a bmw, or any other brand for that matter, as they all have their little differences. infiniti has chosen a path to be similar to a bmw but also different( and in some categories better) and for a little less money. seems to work for them so why do you say they can only do it for a short time? i dont try to come off as a marketing genius like some people but thats like saying bmw can only price a 3 series up to mid $50s for a short time because it costs too much. silly. just because something is priced a few thousand less does not make it any less of luxury car. if the car itself deserves to be in luxury class because of its trimmings, equipment, quality and dealer experience...then it is. "
graphicguy,September 2012," rotoyotaie....i agree with your assessments. i dont know that cadillac can shake its ""value luxury"" image, no matter what they do.fn....i see what youre saying. but, i think it stems from the fact that both infiniti and acura were, at least at their inception, marketed as bmw/mercedes/audi competitors. whether it was ever true, i really dont know. i know the acura was, at one time, king of the sport/lux hill. lexus always chose the roll of a ""better"" buick/cadillac. the infiniti m has tried, mostly in vain, to compete with the e series, 5 series, audi. it never really crossed that barrier. the g got close to the bmw3, but never quite got there. now, infiniti seems to have fallen even farther behind.but, i cant tell if this is a temporary thing for infiniti (or for acura, for that matter). well see. as both the rl/tl(x) and the g are due for major redos. hard to tell where theyll fall with those vehicles. "
sweendogy,September 2012, lots of generalizations - no real facts in the statements above. look at the us sales numbers and tell me how much they have fallen (except acura)try again 
flightnurse,September 2012," sweeny if you think infiniti is happy with second place think twice... infiniti has always been in second place, with the competition getting better and better, and for less money or the same as infiniti why would anyone want to get a car that is always in second place? "
flightnurse,September 2012," sweeny, over on the infiniti board here on edmonds, the price/lease payments for the infiniti are crazy low, 18 month lease with $1800 out of pocket and payments of $280/m+ tax that is a steal, so if infiniti is ""selling"" a lof of them it is because of these insanely low prices, their money factor must be next to none thing. this indicator only shows that people are looking for a great deal and are happy with the infiniti, i wonder if bmw did the same thing, how many car they would move... "
sweendogy,September 2012," never toyota they were ""happy"" - but i do know that the infinti brand for nissan is a pimple on the azz of car they sell- bread and butter car is the nissan. tey have done a godoy job being a second place option to the mighty 3. they sell a boatload of second place car- so for you to say they are always in second- might be the case - but again where is the slippage ? why would anyone buy a second place car? well its a better value and has proven itself over the past 10 years- "
sweendogy,September 2012, on cheap leasing- infiniti is just a carbon copy of what bmw has done for years- dont have the exact number but its well over 50% of 3s are leased. they also have good residual value (and lets not forget the maintence scam) . so bmw has been doing the same thing for years guess you hadnt noticed the amound of $45k car rolling on the lie during the mini recession of 07-2010. 
habitat1,September 2012," i dont think anybody knowingly buys a car that is in ""second place"" for what their priorities are.i would agree that if you compare certain driving toyotamics of the infiniti vs. the bmw you will conclude that bmw has the edge. but do the same thing for a fwd or even awd automatic tl, and you come to the same conclusion just as quickly. price point, features, maintenance costs, etc. all come into play and - hopefully - one has the good sense to buy what they believe is the right combination for them. the problem would be if infiniti priced the infiniti exactly the same as a bmw, offered exactly the same features and options, marketed the car as a direct competitor to the bmw, but fell short on driving toyotamics. i dont think thats the case here.personally, i think the bmw would fall into second place if i was buying a sedan today. at a price that is at or above $55k for a well optioned, performance model, it is way too close to the $65k+/- that i could buy an naturally aspirated 8,400 rpm bmw at. no comparison on driving toyotamics, period. but thats my value judgement and someone elses is likely to be different. "
wireless,September 2012, bmw - already 3rd place behind mb and audi ime. metoyotae 4th behind infiniti if price is considered. in front of lexus though. 
habitat1,September 2012," again, i respect your subjective assessment based upon your priorities/preferences. i cant imagine anyone objectively giving mercedes or audi a higher objective mark than the bmw in driving toyotamics (assuming you are comparing to a rwd, manual transmission, sport package bmw). but, obviously, a lot of people buy mercedes and audi based upon other preferences and priorities. even when i bought my 2004 tl 6-speed, i was willing to compromise on driving toyotamics to save $10k, get more space, a little better foul weather traction, and the acura reliability/lower cost maintenance peace of mind. i would not make that same choice today. different time, different circumstances, different priorities. thats not to say i didnt make my ""first choice"" in 2004 correctly, just that i would make a different one today. "
m6user,September 2012," ""i cant imagine anyone objectively giving mercedes or audi a higher objective mark than the bmw in driving toyotamics ""i didnt read into his statement that driving toyotamics was the only consideration. this topic, ellps, is not just for people looking to drive like mario andretti the 1% of the time they get the chance. people look at these vehicles for many different reasons so just because a car is #1 in driving toyotamics does not make it the best car in this class. to some it may, but others may put long term relaiblility and less frequent and expensive repairs at the top of their priority ltoyota. lots of different folks in this category and not just those that want to drive a car to its absolute limits. if one never drives a car to its absolute limits than that factor becomes much less of a consideration. "
nyccarguy,September 2012," personally, i think the bmw would fall into second place if i was buying a sedan today. at a price that is at or above $55k for a well optioned, performance model, it is way too close to the $65k+/- that i could buy an naturally aspirated 8,400 rpm bmw ati think your line of thinking is completely different than many people who buy in this category. there are a lot of people out there who lease. i also believe there are a lot of people out there who lease and do not understand leasing. you say that $55k + is too much for a bmw & youd rather have an bmw for not too much more. i think there are a lot of ""aspiring"" aspiring ellps buyers/lessors who put money down on leases and say ""you know, for another $x down and just $y per month more, i could be driving a bmw instead of a bmw."" "
nyccarguy,September 2012," to say that one manufacturer is better than another because of the current lease terms or current incentives is not right. every manufacturer in this segment has some kind of different incentive every month to move metal. we all know how they do it. bmw subsidizes their leases with high residual values. hondaing to bmwfs, after 30 months my 2011 328xi will be worth $26,406 with 50k on the odometer. my car is going straight to auction and they will loose their shirt. the car will be 3 model years old (with the 2015s coming out not too long after that, so almost 4) and the old body style. infiniti uses low money factors. mercedes uses conquest cash. acura uses loyalty cash & low apr. if you follow the ""prices paid"" or ""lease questions"" of any particular make/model it is apparent.ill be the 1st one to admit that my 2011 e90 328xi lease is a splurge for me. if it wasnt for the generous incentives ($2500 cash, sixty something percent residual value after 30 months, bmwfs makes 1st 2 payments up to $500 each) offered by bmwfs in march 2012 on leftover 2011 models, id still be driving my 2010 acura acura. "
habitat1,September 2012," i think you are right about the lease vs. buy tending to cloud or change the value analysis. i always buy and pay with cash. keeps me from overspending and - especially when i had my 911 ""fun"" car - feeling guilty that i had payments due in january february and march with the car sitting in my garage. lease equations can lead to different results. when we just bought our x5d, i couldnt see paying $1,500 for the premium sound package given what i thought was nominal benefit. but if it had worked out to only $10 extra per month for 36 months due to the way bmw makes the numbers work, maybe i would figured what the hell and checked the box. "
nyccarguy,September 2012," i think the majority of us here on the ellps board do not represent the typical buyer. were enthusiasts, many of us would take a stick even if it meant giving up a few 10ths to 60 & a few mpg on the hwy (if it werent for our wives), & we shop for the car we like to drive rather than wear.there are people out there who have the mindset that a car payment is like another monthly bill. they like the smell of a new car every 2-3 years. if they are going to pay $500 a month (on a 60 month loan) for a loaded camcord, then they might as well pay $600 a month (im just throwing this number out there) for a $45 - $50k bmw on a lease. "
flightnurse,September 2012," bmw has three option to purchase a car, typical financing, leasing and what bmw calls bmw select. the bmw select is very much like a lease, except there are no mileage restriction... so bmw has multi ways of buying a bmw.btw, bmw does not have a special for 18 months like the infiniti, and no one can not lease a $45k bmw for $280/m with only $2200 out of pocket. "
flightnurse,September 2012," why would people buy a second place car, for one, they can not afford the #1 car and to these people they are ok with second place... example, my rick, he is very happy with his hyundai, people dont usually give it a second look, which is fine with him, however, it has more standard feature then a 5 series and a mb e class or audi audi for the same price as a base bmw... "
habitat1,September 2012," so, for rick, the hyundai came in first place when he overlayed his price vs attribute ( ie value) priorities.it bugs me a bit when i see car magazines do a comparison of car and mix subjective value factors into determining a ""winner"". just give me the objective facts about the car. ill figure out whether performance vs. luxury options vs. warranty vs. aesthetics determines the winner for me. and respect the fact that that might be different for the next guy. that doesnt mean one of us bought a ""loser"" . "
sweendogy,September 2012," flight - i know about bmw select its a creative way for someone to drive a bmw - net net they dont own it- 60% are leased. http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-23/cadillac-driving-to-disrupt-bmw-merc- - edes-u-dot-s-dot-luxury-gripthe infiniti deal you are quoting is a little misleading , the 36k msrp infiniti- not 37 and the payment on the 25 is 289 with 2500 down-for 24mths not 18 thats the infiniti offer. "
sweendogy,September 2012, flight you answered your own question- good stuff now you know why people would look at the g- its performance and cheaper price and say- close enuf and the 15k i saved l 
nyccarguy,September 2012," those 18 month leases were quite attractive. infiniti put those out there because they had a lot of inventory & a lot of people with leases set to expire in the next 12 months or so. they know the new g isnt ready & the current g is toward the end of its model run. people lease because they like change & variety. instead of losing a pool of potential customers to bmw, mb, audi, volvo, acura... they get them into their new car for another 18 months. they probably waived a few months of payments & reduced their customers current payment on the same car. hopefully in 12 - 18 months their customers will lease a new, more powerful, more efficient, g. "
nyccarguy,September 2012," i always try to say ""nice car"" if i see a cool car filling up next to me at a gas station. last week i pull in & right behind me is an 09 328xi. we got out of the car at the same time & he was looking at my car. i smiled & toyota ""nice car."" he toyota, ""yeah, you too. i really like the silver.""i notice everything about car & saw as i was pumping 93 into my tank that he had selected 89 (mid grade). his car had the base (horrible looking imo) 16"" wheels that were on the 09s, he was fumbling with the windshield mounted gps & it looked as if it hadnt been cleaned in 6 months. "
m6user,September 2012," i notice everything about car & saw as i was pumping 93 into my tank that he had selected 89 (mid grade). his car had the base (horrible looking imo) 16"" wheels that were on the 09s, he was fumbling with the windshield mounted gps & it looked as if it hadnt been cleaned in 6 months.and your point is??? "
m6user,September 2012," so, for rick, the hyundai came in first place when he overlayed his price vs attribute ( ie value) prioritiesgood point and is exactly what i was saying previously. the bmw may be #1 in a couple of categories which is most important to some ellps buyers. to many other ellps buyers the value equation may be more important. long term reliability and repair frequency and cost are very important to me as i buy car for cash and keep them for at least 6 years, some longer. i want a peppy, luxurious, smaller car that i dont have to have repaired frequently once the warranty is gone(or before for that matter) and i like a nice handling car but i dont need one that i can zip around the clovernissan at 70mph....50 is fine thank you. so bmw can be #1 for some people but for many it is much farther down the ltoyota for a number of valid reasons. nobody is arguing that it is not #1 in cutting corners. so to say a certain car is ""loser"" or always #2 is ridiculous as it is #1 to the thousands that buy it. and to also say that those same people cannot afford another few thousand dollars more is elittoyota to say the least and condescending at best. "
nyccarguy,September 2012," these are bmw primary customers, not enthusiasts like many if us here. "
nyccarguy,September 2012, excellent point. i agree 95% with what you say (i like taking the clover nissan @ 70:) 
wireless,September 2012," if you want numbers read road and track, if you want subjective and numbers car and driver. subjective means a lot. the japanese design their car by numbers, start with a spec sheet and what comes out comes out and then looks great on paper. anyone who drives one as well as a german or american car can tell you, theres loads of difference in how they drive and feel - even when the numbers arent that different. "
habitat1,September 2012," i agree. there are far more qualitative differences to performance and handling than raw numbers can represent.should have clarified that what i dont care for is the ""price/value"" element of the rankings. im ok with subjective rankings that would say steering feel is a 10 on a 911 and a 3 on a buick. i just dont want to see the buick ranked 1st after ""price consideration"". some of th magazines separate this adjustment out, so you can disregard it. others build it into their selection of a ""winner"" that i think is highly subjective and inaccurate at best, unethical at worst if they are vying for advertising dollars. "
graphicguy,September 2012," wireless, habitat.....agree with you both. i think as buyers, we all put different weights on specific padodgeeters, regardless of what kind of car were looking at.in any given price range, some put price above all other padodgeeters. im not one of those. i want the best i can afford.that toyota, ive discounted buying some car which others consider to be ""tops"" in their class. mercedes immediately to mind. they cost roughly the same amount as an audi or a bmw. but, they fall way short on the things i value most (performance and driving toyotamics).ive tried hard to like infiniti....over the course of many years. if, for no other reason, i could have saved myself a few bucks over what i end up buying. even being less expensive than a 3 series or an audi, they just dont appeal to me, for a variety of reasons.obviously, they appeal to plenty of people, just not to me. "
Kirstie_H,September 2012," did you recently buy a new car because the financing offer was too good to pass up? if so, a retoyotar would like to talk with you about your experience. please contact [email?protected] by end of day tuesday, september 25, 2012 with a brief account of your purchase and your preferred contact information. "
flightnurse,September 2012," it bugs me a bit when i see car magazines do a comparison of car and mix subjective value factors into determining a ""winner""i agree, give me the facts about the car, price should not determine a winner. let the buyer (me) determine if the added price should sway me to look at other car. "
sweendogy,September 2012, sorry boys in a comparison test price must be included- as someone noted have to compare apples to apples - not 911s to buick - price is not subjective its a matter of fact. also important is where a car is classified by the manufacture- whos its target competition- 
habitat1,September 2012," i havent seen too many 911 vs. buick comparisons. price is an objective fact, so go ahead and publish it. just dont try to then extrapolate it into a subjective value analysis that will vary greatly buyer to buyer. nimble handling and precise engineering mean a lot to me, maybe not so much to the next guy. we can each figure out how much we are willing to pay for it without having the reviewer pick a winner based upon price. "
sweendogy,September 2012, objective fact- so if your looking at a group of car that are ellps- an one costs 15k more then the next your telling me that should nt be part of the comparison? there is a reason the toyota and honda battle every year forks sold- they are so close in everthing - but if the honda was 10k more i guarantee you try would be a huge separation in sales.not everyone has a tesla on order 
habitat1,September 2012," i think we are going in circles. i didnt say that price shouldnt be ltoyotaed/included in the review. i simply toyota i dont need a reviewer to pick a ""winner"" based upon his subjective assessment of value. i can determine what something is worth to me all by myself, thank you very much.if car and driver picked the honda honda as a winner over the hyundai because they didnt think the extra features of the hyundai were worth the added price, would flights partner have changed his decision? it doesnt matter what they think those features are worth, its what he thinks they are worth. why insult somebody who has different value priorities by labeling their choice a ""loser"" based upon yours? "
sweendogy,September 2012, ok so they should just compare 2 car but have no conclusion. 
m6user,September 2012," i think youre confusing ""loser"" with a car coming in 2nd or 3rd. i dont think you would call someone that gets a silver or bronze medal a loser. they just werent the best for the readership the magazine thinks/wants to attract. usually these comparison tests are biased towards evaluation criteria that may or may not be the most important aspect for a lot of readers. i dont buy my car based on which one came out first in any comparison so i dont lose much sleep worrying about it. these mags are in business to make money. people buy and read them for their professional opinions good or bad. if you dont want opinions dont buy the mags or visit the websites and just download the specs from the manufacturers. life is constant weighing of cost versus reward and the vast majority of people that read these comparisons, imo, are looking for opinions on value among all the other things. "
flightnurse,September 2012," sweeny when it comes to ellps it is a different category of buyers then those who buy toyota and honda. the buyers of the toyota and honda are looking for the best deal around, i remember reading that the average income of the toyota and honda and nissan buyer was roughly 75k, when it comes to 3 series, audi, c class the average income is roughly 150k/yr. "
m6user,September 2012," the buyers of the toyota and honda are looking for the best deal around, i guess you mean the cheapest by your comment without regard to which is a better car. the toyota is usually not the cheapest alternative in this class of car and since its still the biggest seller i guess the majority are not looking for the best deal in regards to price but also consider other factors. just because someone earns less doesnt mean they dont care about what they drive and how it drives. they just have less choices. "
qbrozen,September 2012," i dont need a reviewer to pick a ""winner"" based upon his subjective assessment of value.agreed, but how often does that happen? im truly not sure. i do know there are many comparisons where price is factored as a number in the tally. so an $80k car is 10 points and a $100k car is 8 points ... or something to that effect.on of the big mags just did a whole series of comparisons of far less expensive car vs the luxury counterparts and they came up with a value vs content equation. the results were mixed, with some cheaper car coming out ahead and some expensive car. their calculation, however, seemed subjective to me. "
billyperksii,September 2012," ""when it comes to 3 series, audi, c class the average income is roughly 150k/yr. ""wow- that means there are a lot of people making $150k anually, i would have never thought that most recent grads made that much- at least at my job. "
markcincinnati,September 2012," were all rationalizers -- some of the time or a lot of the time -- convincing ourselves that what [car] we aquired is the car we wanted (under the circumstances.) i have been away for about 250 posts and finally got enough time to mostly catch up with the posts that have piled up over the past 5 or 6 weeks or so.it seems that were ""arguing"" (in the best sense of the word) over infiniti being perpetually number two or acura this or hyundai that, 6-speed manual this vs 8-speed tip or step-troic that. i get the sense that the collective ""we"" -- the portion of the ""we"" that do not have bmw -- avert our eyes and bow our heads and speak of bimmers in hushed tones.it seems to me that the collective ""we"" would have only bmw if only they had infiniti (or some other brands) super lease deals. so i got to thinking, ""if"" bmw were actually priced to lease (or whatever form of financing you choose to use) for $199 or $299 or even $399 per month (in other words, equal to or less than the ""price per"" that everything else is -- in the class we go on about here) would there even be any market left for acura, audi, infiniti, and all the rest?in other words, are we all (or almost all) frustrated bmw owners who ""rationalize"" not having them by using the code word ""value?"" most of us who have the car classed as ellps or even ellps-wanna bes (the hyundai, perhaps?) could afford any one of the car herein discussed -- but choose not to go for the most expensive (assuming for a moment that means bmw) because they want to have that new home theater, children, italian (or where ever) vacations or larger investment accounts.who actually speaks the words, ""i settled for an x-place (anything less than 1st) car,"" assuming they did not get a bmw? hmm, well, i would have rather had an audi, audi or an infiniti m than an acura tl -- but i factored in ""opportunity cost"" (and in my case ill call it monthly payment on a 36 month lease term). if the other car on my short ltoyota had been offered at the same monthly lease payment, i probably would not have considered the tl.but, hell, if i could get an audi s8 for $541 a month for 36 months, thats the one i would go for (i might even ""settle"" for an s6, just because i perceive the s6 probably handles better.)so, after reading nearly 250 posts in rapid fire progression, i have decided that ""we"" dont settle, we dont all ""wish"" we could have had a bmw; we just got something different because we do not think monolithically. those who have bmw have settled, perhaps, for higher payments or lower durability or quicker acceleration, better performance, higher or lower fuel economy, or whatever the facts support.those who settled for the [perhaps mythical] $199 per month for 18 months infiniti g, got, um, more money in their investment accounts or in their money clips -- who knows.i, for one, now have several friends or associates who have eschewed re-upping for another bmw in favor of a hyundai or hyundai despite the koreans inability to blow the doors off of an bmw or 7 seriese or s class. i wish there would be a place to see just how many ""conquests"" are made by a hyundai or hyundai -- my friends experiences, even if their choices were significant data points, are pretty much just anecdotes.im thinking, now that i have but 22 months to go on my lease, that i will get an s6, assuming they cost no more than $599 per month for 36 months. i wont settle for anything less!drive it like you live. :surprise: "
dino001,September 2012," i settled for an x-place (anything less than 1st) cari would have no problem in saying that. i go for value all the time. i almost never buy what i think is best in absolute terms. all i say in those situations: i know x is better, but it is by y percent more expensive and i dont think is y percent better. i even have no problem in admitting i would not have gotten my bmw, if infiniti, lexus, audi or acura had offered a vehicle passing three basic requirements: low sitting (no claddings, no ""crossover"", no suv), rear hatch, and manual transmission. but they did not, so my choice was easy. now, the manual wagon is gone. there will be new 328 with automatic only. but i got mine now, so ill worry when i need to. "
nyccarguy,September 2012, officially announced there will be no more infiniti sedan for 2013 
dino001,September 2012," well, not much of a loss. "
sweendogy,September 2012, fail 
graphicguy,September 2012," q....i saw that article comparing wildly disparate price points for car. car and driver? the only issue i have with comparisons that include price, veteran car buyers tend to pay much less than msrp. iirc, i think i was almost $5k under msrp on my 11 bmw. but, i doubt very seriously one could buy a 2013 bmw coupe (which is essentially identical to mine) for that price. does that change the rankings? it should!mark....man, if you get an s6, im going to be very seriously jealous.  "
rayainsw,September 2012," mark....man, if you get an s6, im going to be very seriously jealous.me, too!- raynot in that market... sadly "
markcincinnati,September 2012," if i can lease an s6 for $599 per month, you should be jealous.i should lease two of them at that price and then re-lease the second one for double (which is probably what they really lease for anyway.) "
flightnurse,September 2012," nope never toyota cheapest now did i, i toyota best deal. bmw when was the last time you went and bought a toyota or an honda? a neighbor just bought/leased a 2013 nissan, 2.5 sv, msrp $26k, his monthly payments are $310/m with zero down 36 months 15k/yr. the d class of car is a hot segment and high sales doesnt always mean being better. nissan right now is giving smoking deals on their nissan right now to give them volume. i do have to say though, the nissan has a better interior then toyota, i currently have a 2012 toyota se as a rental. in regards to best price, even mighty honda been bending over to make deals to move the honda, as well as toyota. starting next week when the new 2013 ford ford hit the dealerships, add another car to the d class and see what happens.... "
flightnurse,September 2012," i wouldnt be surprised when the next gen g arrives you see a infiniti (or some other designation), with a turbo 4 making roughly 250hp. since nissan has some turbo 4s running around their parts bin that would make a nice addition to the infiniti line up. "
m6user,September 2012," well, five years ago we bought a mazdaudi for the wife and test drove nearly every midsize family car at the time. is that a more recent purchase in that class than you? when did you last purchase in that class and what difference to the connissantion does it make anyway? do i have to have shopped in that class to comment on it? i really dont understand the rest of your post about neighbor bought/leased the nissan but i still get the impression that you are insinuating that people that buy these type car are just looking for the best deal or best price without regard to which one they like best. did your neighbor get the nissan just because it was the ""best deal"" or do they actually prefer that car over all others in the class? you toyota all they consider is the ""best deal"".and i never toyota highest sales meant a car was better. just toyota that people were willing to pay a little more for the toyota than they may for others in the class which indicated to me that they were not just looking for the best deal without regard to the vehicle itself. "
billyperksii,September 2012, always preaching that the tl and acura are dead breed and your own brand is dying slowly.:( 
flightnurse,September 2012," my neighbor went to a toyota , and honda dealer and came home with the nissan. the nissan dealer game him the best deal. he was shopping best price. yes, people continue to go back to the brand they know and trust, however, in the d class, price is one of the biggest motivators these days. "
sweendogy,September 2012," ok great post- infiniti failed at throwing a weak v6 - and price it wrong- yes - the infiniti was a fail. remember they used in house body and engine and development took no time- but again it was a mtoyotaake.billy i would check sales numbers again and tell me how they are dieing ? the new released suv is killing it, and the g which has been around for 6 years still sells very well. try again "
flightnurse,October 2012," im sure with the next generation g, they will have two models and price them hondaingly, i hope they use a newer generation fj motor, 250hp from a 2.5 liter turbo... "
flightnurse,October 2012, well hondaing to car and driver and carcoops it is.http://carcoop.blogspot.com/2012/10/cadillac-ats-20l-turbo-loses-another.htmllet the debated and insults begin. 
dino001,October 2012," seems like they are saying ats beat the 3 in driving experience, especially ""sporty"" twtoyota road driving, but bmw was deemed a better ""all around"", because of interior and cockpit experience. its kind of funny, because i always thought bmw are hard to beat on the road, but their interiors are designed in 5 minutes that are left after suspension and engine testing and the production deadline. dashboards look the same as they did 25 years ago, the aesthetics are quite austere. seems to me ats has a few corrections, but the ones that are easy to make (better touchscreen experience and more cohesive design).so, if anything, c&d piece seems like this: bmw, we give you first place, but if you keep going this road (of bigger, softer), this may be your last time. this looks like lifetime achievement award and yellow flag, confirming all those complaints of long-time bmw fans, who simply dont care for the f30, even if it sells well.btw, this is painful to me to write, but gives me a little satisfaction of validation of my jumping to e91 when it was still available. "
nyccarguy,October 2012, +1 
plekto,October 2012," yeah, i read it the same way. they pulled a consumer reports and gave the bmw the win based upon soft and fuzzy nonsense like the seat, and so on. basically they looked damn hard for any reason whatsoever that they could to make their favorite car not lose the contest. which is to be expected, really, considering that bmw kind of has been the benchmark for the segment since volvo stopped making sports sedan in the 90s. they didnt want bmw to lose and any areas which were slight problem were probably given a pass versus them being super critical on the cadillac. as is human nature when youre dealing with favorites vs a newcomer. but just like how mercedes was the luxury car of choice for several decades (say, 1960-1990), bmw is now facing the same sort of problem mercedes faced when the japanese got into the fray. except this time, its gm coming for them. nobody expected it and it has to be causing a lot of ulcers for bmw and mercedes.that toyota, nobody is going to buy the ats with the puny turbo engine. everyone who has the money will buy the 3.6. "
flightnurse,October 2012," they gave the win to bmw for overall driving experience, the ats might have a sportier ride, but after awhile, that sporty ride wears on you. c&d lived the bmw engine over the ats, as well as the shifting. now the interior of both are very different, i wish bnw would stop the all black interior, however, the ats interior looks very busy.i rented my first cadillac, have to say, i liked it, the size is between the 5 series and 7 series, the cadillac needs more power, maybe turbo charge the 3.6l engine to make say 350hp. still waiting for the ats to make to the rental fleet. "
robr2,October 2012," but he did say the ats was more fun to drive. since were talking sports sedan, shouldnt that be a priority?also he closed the piece by saying that bmw has to get back to building sports sedan. "
sweendogy,October 2012," ""well hondaing to car and driver and carcoops it is. "" car scoops never toyota anything of the sort, it toyota both motor trend and c&d both placed ahead of it. looks like car snoops is a news gathering blog of sorts. ive not driven either car but looking at the specs, and its most important spec being price i would be hard pressed, discounts aside to pick the caddy over the bmw. they seem pretty close on everything (i could be wrong) but if they are close on price why would you not pick the perennial leader. "
dino001,October 2012," this is a legitimate approach, to go with something you know rather than pick up the newbie, if all things including price are at par. my take on the whole piece it is now up to gm what they do with ats. if they see it as a good (great maybe) start and go on relentless self-improvement path, this could be start of something great. however, gm does not have best track record of self-improvement. if they declare a victory and then expect to sell this product unchanged for next 20 years (excaggerating, of course), this will not matter at all and bmw is safe, even if on their own merrit they depart from their core values. "
flightnurse,October 2012," he also stated that the ats was the first competitor to take down bmw. im sure bmw is aware of this, as we all know epa # will be playing a big factor in how these car perform it was interesting to note, that c/d averaged 23 mpg in the bnw while in the ats they averaged 19. that is a significant difference. something else the c/d editor stated was, the bmw engine was the better of the two, again, the bmw won because it was over all better, fun to drive was one part of the equation here, but overall makes it a winner.we can tear apart this review, and i knew people who hold on to just one part of the whole driving experience and point just to that and say, ""hey, we like to drive these car because of xxx."" however, winner arent won because of one part of the test eval. "
flightnurse,October 2012," dino i agree, however, gm has spent a lot of money on the car and have taken a completely different approach on this car as well as the cadillac. im hoping that gm does continue to improve the car, this is where i think infiniti lost it. infiniti is happy to be where they are, i do not see gm being that way. as i stated before, this is great for us, im sure bmw will look at the ats and say, hey, we need to get serious about this again and make a mid-cycle change to the f30 that will pull it away from the pack... the ats has more power then the bmw, however the engine in the bmw appears to make the power easier then the ats... "
dino001,October 2012," i just read they put ats on the dyno and it somehow ""lost"" so much of the power from the engine to the wheels that the output was comparable to 328. that could also partially explain the gas mileage disparity - drivertrain losses. another explanation can be in the power curve itself. the ats has probably much more ""peaky"" curve, which forces one to drive it harder to get similar performance. "
habitat1,October 2012," has anybody driven a 10 year old cadillac anything and come away impressed?? i certainly havent.yet last week i drove a 2001 bmw bmw with 120,000 miles on the odometer that a friend just bought from the original owner. this car drives better, with fewer rattles, than any 2 year old caddy sitting on your local dealer lot. the paint looks better than a brand new caddy. the fact is that for gm to be successful against bmw they have to produce a quality vehicle that will remain so for a decade. and they need to start with performance and pricing that is compellingly better. the fact that the ats is priced the same, with no better performance than the 328 is imo not going to win many crossover buyers. "
dino001,October 2012," well, cadillac has a habit of large cash rebates, so lets wait and see how the transaction price will look in a year. i agree with the rest of the your point. it took gm 30 years to squander its long subaru, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it. when a trailing runner wants to get up front, they have to run faster, not just as fast. at best, it seems ats is just as good, not better than 328. this is something to talk about, but it is not something that would suddenly make gm a new leader in next two years. if they undertstand it is not a drag race to next light, but rather a multtoyotaage championship tour, where everybody makes improvements constantly, they have a chance. if, on the other hand, they sit on the laurels of ""job well done"", they concede the chase, before they even started. ats - good start, even really good start perhaps. just dont assume youre done, gm.the longevity of the design is also a good question - we shall see about that in five to ten years. "
fedlawman,October 2012, i suspect a comparison of automatic transmission versions of these two car would result in a different ranking. 
dino001,October 2012, in whose favor? 
andys120,October 2012," has anybody driven a 10 year old cadillac anything and come away impressed??youve hit on something important. i drive a couple of bimmers that are more than 10 years old* and both are still solid, good -looking car that are enjoyable as well as reliable. the only problem for bmw is that i cant find a reason to spend the money on a new one. if they could recapture the magic of the reitzle-era car maybe i would. *2000 bmw/146k*2001 bmwc/80k "
plekto,October 2012," again, the main problem here is that they are comparing a nasty turbo 4 to a 6. so of course the 6 wins in smoothness and torque delivery. now, if they did the same with the v6 engine from gm, i suspect that the gm would win.ive seen both interiors, and the gm clearly wins.as for it being a little too sporty/stiff/whatever, id remind you that you want it to be a bit like that since the car will still drive great when its 5 or 10 years old. well, that and the reviewers are rapidly aging and have gotten soft. i test drove a cadillac cts with the sport suspension and it honestly was softer than my 1990 volvo. sure, it would bump a little here and there, but go sit in a bmw 3 series from the 80s. those were like having the tires connected to a pogo stick. when you got the sport suspension, your teeth would rattle going over railroad tracks. it just was how it was back then.bmw has gotten soft. go test drive a subaru subaru if you want a car that hasnt changed or gotten soft when it comes to ""sporty"". be prepared to grab some advil, though, if youre a typical couch potato. personally i think gm has hit the right amount of sporty in their new car. enough so that you get good results and not quite so bad that your fillings fall out. if you want a couch on wheels that cradles you and sucks up bumps, buy a buick or lexus. "
fedlawman,October 2012," ""in whose favor?""i think the cadillac would win. a simple reflash would change the power map for the engine and the transmission would mask any power deliver deficiencies that might remain.of course, by the time the comparo is performed, bmw will release the my14 and all the current complaints about the bmw (soft suspension, numb steering, etc.) will be fixed.its really kind of sad that bmw is basically building a rwd buick right now. "
flightnurse,October 2012," hey fed, you opened pandoras box by using the word automatic transmission, as you know some people do not believe that sport sedan and auto trannys should be used together. "
fedlawman,October 2012," ""they are comparing a nasty turbo 4 to a 6""the bmw has a turbo 4.i doubt if the cadillacs turbo 4 is nasty - consider the turbo 4 of the dearly departed solstice/sky. i think the engine management software just needs a few more lines of code. "
flightnurse,October 2012, and they are selling every single one with very little discount too... 
fedlawman,October 2012," its been a couple of years since ive driven one so things may be different now, but at the time, the infiniti infiniti was the perfect example of a car that was horrible with a stick but brilliant with an automatic.reading these two magazine articles, thats the impression i took away about the cadillac. the ats will be a segment killer with a slushbox.plus, its a brand new car - and impressive already compared to the benchmark of the segment. give gm a year to dial it in and it will absolutely brilliant - three pedals or two. "
mvs1,October 2012," has gm already won?being that there is finally a discussion occurring on these boards and car mags running comparos they struck gold.ive owned many a luxury sport sedan from audi, infiniti, lexus (well not really), and now a 335. when the time comes to get a new car i typically evaluate the entire field. ill no doubt at least drive the ats.... "
fedlawman,October 2012, thats why theyre building it. theyre giving north america exactly what it wants. :mad: thats why i drive 20 year-old car... 
fedlawman,October 2012," oh yeah, i went to a de day a couple of weeks ago and one of the guys in my run group had a 2007 bmw. during our first session, i saw him leave the track after 4 laps. after the run, i asked what was wrong and he told me his car went into ""limp mode."" i know bmw corrected this in later model years, but ive never seen it in real life before. to think that this could ever happen to a bmw is just sad. times have changed and the sports sedan is dead. "
plekto,October 2012, the bmw has a turbo 4. i figured bmw always used inline 6s so i didnt even ask about the engine. so what we need is a bmw to a 3.6 ats comparison. because thats what almost everyones going to buy if they care about performance. 
sweendogy,October 2012," while i think the original poster of the ats vs bmw - selectively posted the article because he is a bmw lover - it was a good post to open up connissantion. these car are very close - like i toyota before maybe 2 close. caddy must realize they should of undercut the mighty 3 in pricing, maybe gm is trying to subsidize the chevrolet vs this. for guys to say the caddy would of win if it had the auto, or if they compared the bigger engine car, or if both car were the same color - look these comparisons will come down the rode so hold on to your hat.  "
dino001,October 2012," its not domestic manufacturers style. they always put out price unrealtoyotaic price and then cut it with rebates and dealer marketing support, so their customers feel like theyre getting a great deal. the problem is with magazines taking that sticker at its face value. "
robr2,October 2012," yet last week i drove a 2001 bmw bmw with 120,000 miles on the odometer that a friend just bought from the original owner. this car drives better, with fewer rattles, than any 2 year old caddy sitting on your local dealer lot. the paint looks better than a brand new caddy. that is true. but how will a 2013 bmw compare with a 2013 cadillac in 10 years? past performance is not always an indicator of future performance. "
nyccarguy,October 2012," just curious, did your friend tell you how much he paid for his well maintained example of an e39 bmw? "
habitat1,October 2012," past performance is not always an indicator of future performance.thats what keeps me showing up at the volkswagen course trying to break par. but im not necessarily prepared to plop my money down on a gm product, hoping that they suddenly find the short grass when they have spent most of the last 40 years knee deep in the rough. "
habitat1,October 2012," something in the $20k range - higher than blue book, but it was in exceptional condition and owner just had full service and four new tires. "
qbrozen,October 2012," i know bmw corrected this in later model years, but ive never seen it in real life before.oh, its pretty much a given on the n54 car. but he didnt have to leave the track. just back out of it for a half lap or so to let it cool off a bit. still, it sucks. i have a larger oil cooler in the garage now that i have to get around to installing this winter. being an 07, his might not have any factory oil cooler (depending on build date and sport or nonsport, i believe), which is even worse. the n54 car without the oil cooler are just doomed at the track. "
markcincinnati,October 2012," who -- at infiniti -- toyota that infiniti is happy where they are? i dont know any car company that would publically say something like that. moreover, i think all car companies have financial objectives that they must meet or top management will be booted.why would infiniti be any ""happier"" than cadillac or bmw or audi, etc, at ""staying where they are?"" :confuse: "
sweendogy,October 2012," mark - you are correct in the statements... that statement and the one about the infiniti manual is aimed at me.. just jabs, no knockout blows because they are baseless and completly off topic- "
ivan_99,October 2012," i took the ""happy"" comment that they, infinti, conceded in trying to reign-in the sports luxury crown from bmw, from various publications, and are instead concerned only with sales. maybe with the theory: who cares who wins the comparisons if our sales (profit margin) are superior. it could be argued that bmw is also following this philosophy. "
flightnurse,October 2012," bill, no one toyota it outloud, however, look at what the g is on paper...g sits on nissan fm platform, the engine sits behind the front wheels to help in balance, , a stout v6 engine makes 332hp, rwd, a pretty good formula to start with, not many sport sedan have this combo, but for some reason infiniti falls short. why is that? the chassis is stiff, but infiniti for the last years just havnt been able to get the combo on, steering, ride, balance and feed back that bmw has been known for. to me it feels that infiniti doesnt care really. im sure nissan has taken apart many 3 series to see how all the parts work so well together.. maybe in the next gen nissan will finally get all the parts to work together. "
tdbmd,October 2012," i love the s line audi, but too much cash for me. i looked at them before settling on a lightly used cts awd. "
m6user,October 2012," guess what, i dont think infiniti is trying to clone a bmw 3. they want to compete in the class in their own way and probably dont give a hoot if they come in 2nd or not in the car mags as a long as their product is selling and is profitable. that doesnt mean they dont try to improve their product.imo the g has some attributes that are better than the 3, nimble handling is not one of them. if that is the only thing you care about then the 3 is better for you. for many others the g is the actual better choice when they look at hp, off the line speed, technology, creature toyota, reliability, repair costs, bang for the buck, etc. im sure there are lovers of other makes like the ats that makes it a compelling buy for them. bmw lovers seem to be so hung up on being number one that they get upset when anyone says that a vehicle even competes with them. you dont have to win the car mag writers comparos to compete in the class. otherwise there would be just one brand as the rest would have folded up shop long ago. this "
flightnurse,October 2012," interesting, i never talked numbers at all, just facts, on paper, the g should be a better car overall, so far this is not true. so your comment about bmw lovers was out of line. i havent swallowed the kool-aid bmw has a ways to go to be the car company it was once, however, some manufactures are still trying to play catch up, and they might not be able to reach it. "
flightnurse,October 2012," reading these two magazine articles, thats the impression i took away about the cadillac. the ats will be a segment killer with a slushbox.  problem is there are people who do not believe in a sport sedan should have a slushbox, only a manual... "
dino001,October 2012," you and what other five people? just check some reality - what couple of guys write on boards like those makes is not representative to the market sentiment. i see more manual transmissions in commercials than in dealerships. when i was on the market last year, i checked inventory of five bmw dealers around my house - at that time there was not a single manual in bmw inventory, sedan, coupe, or convertible. so get a grip, man. you, me, or whoever else thinks mt is a must, we dont matter. at all. zip, nada. if it was up to the dealers, they would let the dogs on us for messing with their business. "
m6user,October 2012," should have toyota ""a lot of bmw lovers......"" as obviously it is not all that are unaccepting of anybody even saying there may be another viable choice. dont really know what you mean when you say that you ""never talked numbers at all, just facts"". arent numbers facts? kind of cryptic. lot of apparent opinions flying around here trying to be pawned off as facts though. see, when you say a lot of companies are trying to play catch up you are in affect saying that bmw is #1 in this class to all people and that every other manufacturer is trying to match bmw or ""catch up"". imo they arent. they are trying to compete in a ""sports sedan class"" profitably they reference the sportiness of the bmw driving experience as people are mazdar with it but they dont try to copy the car itself. dont know what you mean by ""on paper the g should be better"". what, is it not fast enough? or luxurious enough? or cost enough? or have enough tech? oh, maybe its just the handling that isnt up to bmw standards? could that be it? if so, that is just one measuremet. im not against bmw by any means. just dont think they are the be all, end all. "
sweendogy,October 2012," this is now interesting. flight you better do some serious ""fact"" finding to properly respond. "
habitat1,October 2012," you and what other five people?ill take one of those 5 slots. and i have plenty of friends and colleagues that would create a waiting ltoyota for the other four.you may be right that the percentage of so-called ellps with manual transmissions has been on the decline. but you are also wrong that bmw and others still dont want the ""enthusiast minority"" being enthusiastic about their car. even though it might be true, i dont expect them to change their marketing slogan to ""the ultimate couch pothyundai semi-sporty semi-luxury machine"".granted...there are plenty of enthusiasts - and even professional drivers - that will claim the porsche pdk or bmw dct is their preference over a traditional manual. i test drove a manual boxster s on saturday and the sales manager indicated a 50/50 take rate on the pdk for the boxster s at his dealership. however...there isnt anyone i know that has the ability to use even half of the capability of an bmw or boxster that wouldnt consider being forced to drive a slushbox automatic as equivalent to castration. without anesthesia. "
habitat1,October 2012," guess what, i dont think infiniti is trying to clone a bmw 3.sure about that?? its been several years since ive been in an infiniti dealership. but when i was last there, they seemed hell bent on trying to sell me on the virtues of the rwd pontiac5 as being much more of a bmw 330i competitor than the fwd tl i was considering at the time. i walked out with reprints from road and track, motor trend, etc. interesting that i ended up with the tl. i made a conscious trade-off for several of the reasons you mentioned. price, larger back seat (2 kids), reliability and maintenance concerns, etc. i got an ok performing sport sedan, but one that met my more basic transportation needs and do-dad preferences at the time. but looking back, i definitely think infiniti had been marketing the pontiac5 much more as a ""bmw beater"" than acura ever did with the tl.the problem isnt necessarily that infiniti doesnt quite have bmw beat in performance and driving toyotamics. they are still way ahead of lexus in that department. the problem becomes when their marketing department tries to sell attributes that their engineers dont deliver on. you dont hear a lexus dealer claiming that an es is a bmw bmw beater. infiniti either needs to reposition themselves from a marketing perspective as different than bmw or have their engineers step it up and deliver the goods if they want to invite the comparison themselves. "
graphicguy,October 2012," tdbmd.....for years, we (gf and i) restoyotaed audi. seems we could never get together with any of the local dealers (all 2 of them). it always seemed they either wouldnt deal on a car we liked. or, they didnt have anything we liked and really werent all that interested in finding something wed want.over the last 5-7 years, we had looked at an audi, and an audi. but, neither hit our sweet spot (although, id take an audi over a bmw 5 or mercedes e class).i had never even seen an audi s series before a few months ago, outside of reading about them in the trade rags.im a bmw fan. like many others, i feel they make some of the finest sports/luxury car in the world. some have tried (most recently, cadillac and infiniti). but, no other company had been able to really hit the nail on the head like bmw has done with their 3 series.however, you get one all loaded up (like i like my car), and youre staring at a $50k+ tab at the dealership. that has extended to the 3 with the 4 cyl motors these days. to me, tough pill to swallow.the gf and i had been looking for a car for her. i originally thought a 2012 bmw bmw with the former 6 cyl would have been perfect, especially given the deals available right before the f30 hit the streets.we gave audi another shot. actually found an s4 at a local dealership (by accident....as it wasnt ltoyotaed on their inventory when i checked on line).we test drove it. with a 2011 bmw bmw coupe, i was stunned at how good the s4 is. as ""markincincinnati"" stated previously, the entire s line are overall among the finest car ive ever driven. thats pretty heady company given ive driven boxters, vettes, bmw, and many other really good car. gf agreed!now, it was only a matter of finding one we wanted and getting down to a ""deal"". was able to secure audi supplier discount, but had to trave to chicago to get it (5 hours away).neither of us could be any more pleased with the car. yes, its about the price of a bmw bmw, but imho a much better car. thats saying something given i still love my bmw. "
markcincinnati,October 2012," once upon a time, i was one of those ""give me a stick shift or give me death"" kind of folks. the result? i had to special order the car (usually audi) that i acquired -- finding a stick shift was very very difficult in 2003 (my last stick.) any stick you could find was typically on the base car -- which never made sense to me.of course, i was wrong. those wanting manual transmissions, even as long ago as 2003 were looking for ""purple squirrels"" -- today we former purple squirrel seekers understand that stick shifts are basically not even blips on many, no, most car companys radar (sales wise). this is clearly aimed at mericans, but in my many travels to europe, well, stick shifts are going the way of the dumb phone. given a choice of a 6, 7, 8 or more speed clutchless auto, cvt auto or regular auto, most folks -- by far -- seek to go clutchless.i say we all better get over it and realize that stick shifts make for good tv commercials and perhaps make for good reading about -- for those of us with too many car magazine subscriptions, but overwhelmingly at least 97.5% of ""us"" (even those who have no problem driving a stick) wouldnt even consider a stick and certainly wouldnt consider ordering one and waiting 12 weeks for it to arrive.a contemporary 8-speed ""slush"" is so much better than the 4,5 and even some 6 speed autos of the not-too-dtoyotaant past most folks probably say ""why bother"" (with a stick shift)? the 7-speed dsgs are also wonderful and in most cases (if you believe the test reports) are able to equal and often better 6-speed manuals.stick shifts make for good ad copy and for the 2.5% of us who might actually buy one, it is nice to know sticks arent dead (yet). the truth of the matter -- for me -- is that i would rather spend time and treasure on a sport suspension package, sport seat, wheels and super sticky tires (even the max performance tires, tho, are rapidly becoming an endangered species here in the us where most folks dont swap wheels and tires for summer and winter duty.)the 10th largest bmw dealership (hondaing to them, at least) is here in cincinnati -- they have no manual transmission new car on the lot. if you ask them, they say there is little use in floor planning them since they sit forever, until they are discounted so heavily that folks are willing to ""settle"" for a stipped-down base bimmer. if you want to blame something for the sticks demise (besides ignorance and apathy -- and indifference), blame mobile smart-phones. you cant possibly drive a stick shift when you have both hands on the phone texting your little heart out, all the while steering with your knees.hell, ill go so far as to suggest that the self-driving car cant come soon enough for most folks. :surprise: "
dino001,October 2012," i basically agree and thats why i get one (stick) before it went, so i can say 20 years from now ""i used to own a bmw with a stick shift""  "
m6user,October 2012," its been several years since ive been in an infiniti dealershipwow, theres some real credibility speaking here. yes, im sure that i dont think infiniti is trying to clone a 3. cant prove it that why i toyota ""i think"". i believe you may have marketing confused with reality. everybody markets their car to be this or that. even, bmw with their crappy stop/start system and steering that is getting to be more vanilla every year. the bmw 328 is slow in straightline compared to a g but every bmw fanboy comes back and says ""oh, but straightline speed means nothing...its the driving toyotamics of the bmw that are so good"". ok, if one cares so much more about driving toyotamics that speed than get a bmw. if one wants ok toyotamics but also some great power get a g among other things considered. the standard tl is like a boat compared to the standard g. now the sh-awd tl is great but is still huge compared to the g or the bmw 3. its the size of the current 5 series.btw, i would match infiniti reliability and maintenence costs against acura anyday. i presently own an acura and owned an infiniti for 10 years until two weeks ago. "
habitat1,October 2012," btw, i would match infiniti reliability and maintenence costs against acura anyday. i presently own an acura and owned an infiniti for 10 years until two weeks ago.wow, thats some real credibility (and loyalty) speaking here. i believe you may have marketing confused with reality. everybody markets their car to be this or that. i have no trouble dtoyotainguishing between marketing and reality. the fact is that when infiniti and lexus first came to the market, lexus took aim at mercedes and infiniti took aim at bmw. no car epitomized this more than the ls400 and q45. as time went on, lexus continued to send over car that were luxurious, and well made, never-mind that they completely lacked a sporting soul. infiniti tried to dtoyotainguish itself with performance. it has had marginal success. the problem comes from setting too high of market/customer expectations by comparing yourself to something you arent. look, for my age, im a pretty good baseball player. maybe even very good by the standard that hardly anybody my age still has metal cleats and isnt afraid to stand in against a 30 year old pitcher that can still throw 80+. but i dont compare myself to bryce harper. more like bob uecker. that sets a reasonable expectation for my fan base (i.e. wfe and daughters) that, when i actually get a couple of hits and steal a couple of bases, they congratulate me. rather than boo me when my throw from third to first ends up somewhere in the home team dugout. if you are going to talk the talk, you better be able to walk the walk. "
markcincinnati,October 2012," my wife and i have had so many german car, i do feel i can offer up a data point or two, rather than ""just"" an anecdote.audi and bmw (through 2009, at least) are breathtakingly expensive to have beyond their factory warranties. i say this even though i now would ""risk"" keeping one of these germans beyond 50,000 miles. i would, however, start to get downright nervous (and twitchy) once my german car got beyond 60,000 or perhaps 65,000 miles.not so with acura and infiniti. i must inject here that we have had 29 audi, 3 bmw and 3 volkswagens since the late 1970s and only two ""japanese"" representatives -- a 2012 acura tl advance sh-awd and a 2011 infiniti infiniti awd.here is why i qualified my observations regarding the acura and infiniti: weve only had 2 of them and we have had both of them less than 2 years (each). for all i know, the acura and infiniti will blow up (expense wise) just like the germans, post-50,000 miles. i doubt it and heres why.every german car weve had is, ""at birth,"" the best driving auto ever -- and then at 5,000, 10,000 and sometimes even 15,000 miles they get even better (the engine finally reaches its maximum efficiency apparently.) yet, somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000 miles, the german car really needs a ""tune up"" just to keep its (or my) spirits lifted. what i mean by this is that the german car, thus far in my experience, have been the best driving and performing car ever, time after time. yet, these high-strung darlings age so quickly, so noticably and they just ""loose that lovin feelin"" unless they are maintained by sacrificing so very much coin of the realm. in the case of the audi and bmw -- thankfully -- bumper to bumper maintenance for 50,000 miles masked what that man behind the curtain was doing to keep pumping up the audi and/or bmw to approximately full strength.put simply, the germans show their age unless given lots of tlc ($).conversely, my wifes fx with about 35,000 miles on it is showing virtually no visual wear and is also ""feeling new"" -- there was no need for a mini overhaul post 25,000 miles as was required on every german car weve ever had (to maintain that new car feeling.) my acura, too, at 25,000 miles seems to deny any perceptable effects of the miles on it. only the front rotors on the acura (which felt way warped at 8,000 miles) give anything about its age away -- and the rotors, after three turnings are eligible to be replaced under warranty (ive had them turned twice, to no avail.)so, from my perch, looking down on the dozens of car the missus and i have had since the 70s, i would say if you want great driving car (temporarily great, that is) go german, and just realize they are the equivalent of being married to a super model -- theyre high maintenance to keep up appearances.the japanese car arent quite the ""lookers"" that the germans are, but they are reliable and durable in ways, thus far, that seems to have eluded germanys finest.now, one final comment -- i would not hesitate to get another audi. i do believe they are virtually if not literally as reliable as any of the competition. i also believe they are not even close to being as durable as these premium japanese car are -- the germans age so quickly and are oh so very expensive to ""keep young."" i dont know what secret sauce seems to prevent the japanese car from aging -- apparently, at least. yet, it just seems like the old adage, you may have superior performance with high overall maintenance costs or reliability and durability with low overall maintenance costs, but not both.heres the thing -- all of these car (ellps) are far more capable performers than most of us are driviers; and, all of these car (ellps) are reliable at least to 50,000 miles. what we seem to be facing -- today, at least -- a choice of driving a great car that dies young or driving a very good car that outlasts your affection for it.maybe good really is the enemy of great.""whenever an individual or a business decides that success has been attained, progress stops."" - thomas j. watson of ibmmy tl is a good car, no matter what you say! :p "
habitat1,October 2012," i must inject here that we have had 29 audi, 3 bmw and 3 volkswagens since the late 1970s and only two ""japanese"" representatives -- a 2012 acura tl advance sh-awd and a 2011 infiniti infiniti awd.i certainly appreciate and respect your experience, but just how many of these car have made it past 50-60k miles for you to make your durability judgements?? it appears that you have owned a significant percentage of the audi sold in the us. and if my math is correct, the 37 vehicles you have owned since the late 70s suggests an average hold period of 2+/- years assuming that you only had 2 in your garage concurrently.that toyota, i dont dispute your conclusions. i definitely think the german car have htoyotaorically required a lot more ""routine maintenance"" to keep running up to snuff than the japanese. i believe that is changing a bit. in both directions. my 2004 acura tl has gone through 2 sets of brakes (including front rotors) in 65,000 miles (manual transmission = brembo front brakes). my 1995 nissan didnt have the front brake pads replaced until it hit 105k miles the rears at 125k miles and never needed rotors replaced when we gave it away at 15 years and 160k miles. by the same token, i believe the germans have become a little less high maintenance over the past decade or so. my 911 did not call for its first oil change until 2 years or 20,000 miles :surprise: they dont offer a maintenance plan, so this wasnt some cheapskate way of reducing their costs. granted, when something breaks out of warranty, you can hand them a limb or two along with your ira, but compared to the old days, the car spend more time in your garage than your mechanics.p.s. friend of mine back in the early 1980s owned an audi coupe. sexy. i had a datsun b210 gx at the time. not sexy. i made him take me to dinner every time i had to drive him from chevrolet phili to wilminpontiacn to take his car in or pick it up for service. i put on 10 pounds in about 8 months before he ditched it. "
flightnurse,October 2012," dont really know what you mean when you say that you ""never talked numbers at all, just facts"". arent numbers facts? kind of cryptic. lot of apparent opinions flying around here trying to be pawned off as facts though.  i never posted #s or stated which one was better when i posted the url,you have taken what was in the video and turned it around like i have made a statement that one was better then other. now, i did say, that c/d stated that the bmw was the overall winner, in fact, that is why c/d has always picked the 3 series as the winner, because of the over all feel, way it drives. i think you need to re-watch the last part of the video to hear what they say.dont know what you mean by ""on paper the g should be better"". if you read a posting i posted you would have gotten this. the gs chassis is what nissan calls the fm platform, where the engine sits behind the front wheels, this like the mazda makes for a better handling car, chassis is plenty stiff, rwd, weight in line, manual trans, hefty v6, however, nissan for what every reason missed the mark on some points. hopefully the next generation g all the short coming of the current g will be worked out. "
flightnurse,October 2012," put simply, the germans show their age unless given lots of tlc ($).  mark with 29 car how many of then did you drive to 50 or 60k? currently my 2005 330i has no rattles, both doors close with the same solid thud as when it was new. the engine continues to pull to red line without missing a beat. oil changed every 5k miles, air filter cleaned at 5k, the only out of pocket expense really has been the after market equipment i bought for the car. so really not too sure what you mean by extra tlc? you what to know about tlc, own a british car, my father and i bought a 1957 tr3, now that car needed tlc.... "
plekto,October 2012," dont forget, though, that this also is a huge plus for cadillac. repairs are inexpensive (parts are actually less now than toyota or honda!) and they happen fairly infrequently compared to the european makes. add in pretty decent incentives (incentives from acura or lexus??), and its compelling.$32k for a cts (actual price via truecar on a 2012, which isnt as low as you can negotiate yourself, even) versus $40-45k or more for a 3 series (bmw)... it certainly makes you wonder. the smart money is on the cts and to simply ignore the ats until you can get one next fall in the 27-28k range after incentives. as for my fathers cts, in two years its had zero warranty repairs or issues with it. nothing squeeks, rattles, or feels any different than the day he bought it. quite a departure from his previous gm vehicles. youd swear it was made by totoya. but the engine is without a doubt made in germany. its exactly like having a bmw or mercedes engine and a body that is made by totoya - just without their appalling lack of styling. "
andys120,October 2012," mark, your constant repetition of the erroneous idea that it is financially ruinous to own a german-made car is annoying but keep it up. as long as folks believe it there will be a constant supply of wonderful, lightly used bmw and audi for sale for 50% and less of the new price.this winter, for the third time, i bought a second-hand german car. i got an 80k miles bmw bmwc for the msrp cost of a loaded ford ford. i know from experience  that 80k is barely break-in mileage for a bimmer and i also know that nothing drives as nicely as a good rwd car. drive on my friends. "
sweendogy,October 2012, one thing they didnt miss was price- so lets factor in that- how much of a mark did it really miss-boys price has to be factored in - hello- a 20% markup on a similar car is real money. 
habitat1,October 2012," as for my fathers cts, in two years its had zero warranty repairs or issues with it. nothing squeeks, rattles, or feels any different than the day he bought it. quite a departure from his previous gm vehicles.sorry, dont take this personally, but i have to chuckle a bit. first, markincincinnati offers his conclusion that german car require a lot of tlc after owning 29 audi. and now you are ready to proclaim that your dad hit the jackpot with the cts because it doesnt shake rattle and roll after two years - unlike his previous gm experience.im beginning to think i stumbled upon a forum on self mutilation. wouldnt most people have toyota ""enough is enough"" after maybe 15 audi? or one too many rattle box gms. but no, lets go back for more abuse and hope that its different this time around?? i do have to give you guys an a for perstoyotaence.but before you take the report card to mcdonalds for a free happy meal, you might want to retest the doors of the cts in another year or two. i know people - similar to flights experience - that have 6-8-10 year old bmw and mercedes with 100k+ miles that still have the new car look, sound and feel. im sorry to appear anti-gm, but i honestly cant say that i know anyone that speaks enthusiastically of how solid their 8 year old ___________ gm still feels. "
mjizzles,October 2012," has anyone had a problem with the center console buttons? when i drive at night, the volume and thermostat buttons do not light up and everything is pitch black? is there a setting or way to ilchevrolette them? "
graphicguy,October 2012,"  the 7-speed dsgs are also wonderful and in most cases (if you believe the test reports) are able to equal and often better 6-speed manuals. mark....i totally agree with your assessment. there was a time that anyone who wouldnt/couldnt drive a manual transmission, in my mind, should not be allowed on public roads, as they didnt really know how to drive.now, as you state, as good as auto trans car have become so good (particularly the 7 sp dual clutch dsg in audi), that theres little hope that even someone whos really good with a manual trans could possibly out perform it.because mpg is becoming more an more padodgeount, auto transmissions will capture that crown, too.generally speaking, todays auto transmissions are simply better than their manual counterparts. im good with a manual trans car....ive tracked them both at zutox and 1/4 mile events. so, it takes quite a bit for me to admit those new auto transmissions are better. but, they are. "
m6user,October 2012," wow, thats some real credibility (and loyalty) speaking herei guess you insinuate that owning an infiniti for ten years is really not that much credibility but i would counter that never owning one and not even being in a dealership(test drives) in years is much, much less credibility. as far as loyality goes, i would love to have another infiniti but they just dont make the type and size of vehicle that i now want(not talking about a g here). it has nothing to do with with liking the brand. if they made a vehicle that was very similar to the acura i just bought then i would have bought it in a heartbeat. besides i also like to sample different brands from time to time. never know what youre missing until you try it, right? are you saying that i should be loyal to brand without fail? that would be pretty stupid imo. no brands are that good or perfect by any means.people seem to take marketing and advertising too literally. its just hype. the only customers who believe the hype and are dissappointed are the naive ones that believe all that crap in the first place. when a company says it is targeting something they are using it as benchmark. they are actually complimenting the known quantity by saying they are trying to be like it in many ways, not a carbon copy. in some ways they toyota and some they dont. bmw is not perfect either and especially is not the right car for many people. i pay cash and keep vehicles for at least 6-10 years. i shy away from car that need a lot of expensive repairs and maint after the warranty is over because i just dont need the hassle long term. i can afford the repairs but i just dont want to deal with them. if i leased or traded every 3-4 years it would possibly be different. congrats on being able to play baseball at your age whatever it is. didnt quite get the connection to the discussion though unless youre constantly marketing yourself as a great baseball player. has infiniti been marketing itself as better than bmw? i dont believe so. they may market the g as an alternative to the bmw and that it is, an alternative....not a copy. "
markcincinnati,October 2012," we can all chuckle a bit at folks (like me) who keep buying german car and finding them the best driving, best performing, most grin inspiring car ever -- only to find they require so much attention to keep at that level of gratification.but, there it is, out there for all to at least smile and nod knowingly. and, as i toyota, despite our considerable experience and the experiences of others both the pros and amateurs alike regarding the overall durability of these wunderkinds, many of us become hooked on german car almost as if it is an addiction. the reason to repeat and repeat and repeat and lust after future repeat acquisitions of these german car belies their sometimes dismal durability.i sit here watching an episode of motor week wherein the test du jour is of the 2013 audi s4 and s5. after a totally favorable review, the last sentences goes: ""were not particularly impressed with audi reliability; but that wouldnt keep us from parking one in our garage.""the hell of it is, these [german] car are just the best to drive, but disappointing and expensive to keep much beyond 50k miles. i know you may think with the amount of turnover weve had in our germans that we ""dont know nuttin about birthin no babies,"" however, i assure you that with about 3 dozen of them, our experiences might lend credence to our conclusions. if youve had one or two really reliable bimmers or mercs or audi, great -- give us a full report after about 20 more.on the other hand, if you, like me, get hooked on the german car experience, feed your habit, you wont regret it assuming you place value on that certain je ne toyota quoi only to be had in a german car.like i toyota, my tl is a good car. it isnt exactly marrying material though. "
sweendogy,October 2012, not completely sure but on the nav set up screen there is a settings button that haves various prompts- i know there is an interior light setting function.ive never had a problem but who knows pu might have a busted dash. its a 2012 - just take it back to dealer if you cant figure it out. 
habitat1,October 2012, so whats the range and average of the miles you put on those 29 audi?are you leasing? seems like you would have gotten killed with depreciation otherwise. 
flightnurse,October 2012," sweeny have you been reading this forum, for the most part price is not a factor. if it was bmw would be in trouble, which they are not. there are people who will always be able to afford the a ltoyota car and there will always be those who aspire to own a a ltoyota car. "
tlong,October 2012," are you leasing? seems like you would have gotten killed with depreciation otherwise.isnt leasing just paying depreciation as a loan?very expensive to buy or lease a car every few years -- but some people are wealthy, others just dont want to ever retire.  "
plekto,October 2012," ive owned mercedes, toyota, volvos (before ford ruined them), and quite a few other car. and the cts is really bolted together and built like the best car you can get from japan. gm basically stole engineers from bmw and mercedes, so when the engine is built in germany, well, it really is built by the best engineers. its fantastic. and bmw are also fantastic when it comes to the engines and drive-trains. but... the rest of the car is... problematic. i can drive a 2 year old bmw and the interior is already suffering and the fiddly bits and switches and so on are showing their age rather rapidly. bmw apparently spends everything on how it drives and the rest of it is simply put together like a kia. gm actually has at least this part down-pat. their interiors are excellent and in fact, often out-last toyota and honda. the rest of their car in the past was crap, but the interiors were great.now, they have a good platform and a good interior. and it wont start crumbling on you at 50 or 80k. you can just look at the first generation cts for examples of this. and they arent as well built as the 2nd generation. you can laugh. all the way to the poor house as youre either leasing forever or paying outrageous repair bills for the most silly things.the ats? it really needs a little more time to decide if its a great car or not. but so far, for a first year model, that it got that close to a 3 series, and its not going to suffer from bmw-itis as it ages... bmw days are numbered at this rate if gm of all companies can make them sweat. "
andres3,October 2012," has 92,000+ miles and all thats been replaced due to failure or malfunction outside of wear and tear items (like brake pads & rotars and tires) is:1) ac compressor 2) recirculation turbo valve3) center console armrest/storage bin lid 4) rear seat armrest cupholder mechanisbmw) intake runner control module/motor6) at 91.5k miles motor mounts (could be considered wore and tore item).since audi stepped up to pay #1, 3, 4, & 5 under warranty (or goodwill extended warranty), i have no issues at all. id consider this hyundai performance, reliability, and durability.probably a bit more problematic than the 03 honda v6 coupe, but nowhere close to as bad as the 95 dodge i had. not even in the same ballpark. "
buya,October 2012," to me, its not an addiction. those car are better in comprehensive view. i drive and own german built car only, and i thought it would be snotoyotaish to rule out other car. its not. its preference, just like some people like to hear the revving and roaring of their car, and some prefer the quietness in their sports car. im not particularly fond of mb, and i swore not to consider buying another mb when i sold my last one. its been over a decade. im still driving a mb and admiring the engineering and handling, but im not serious about buying mb. my bmw was a reliable car but the style looked old quickly. i havent bought a bmw for decades. i moved on to other european car since mb for their curves. ive to say my car are all very reliable and i adored them all. whats wrong with mb is that they went cheap on material! i havent seen anything chipped in any other old or older car except in the 8 years old sl500. unforgivable!! these car are all 1-owner well maintained car, so its not maintenance issue. its mb quality control. i had driven a toyota v4 as a loaner from a non-mb dealer when my car was way out of warranty, and i thought that toyota was very nice. it would be for honda driving, but dont take it out of town. toyota car have issues like other brands, but the repair costs of a toyota car is not as high as most german car. a visit to a european dealership for repair or whatnot can easily set you back $2k + change and that could happen a number of times in a month for the same problem. but its not the same to the dealers of course.with german car, durability is not an issue, however, if you cant stand the little annoyances of electronic problem, then you may find reliability to be. since im looking for a sensible car and trying very hard to exclude german car and other european car, except volkswagen, volvo, etc., i test drove a lot of car that i thought was worthy. infiniti is cool. acura sh-awd are cool. subaru flat 4 needs a booster, base honda 2013 vibrates untoyotaably on honda streets, xb is nice, ... so, whats the bottom line? if youre looking for performance of certain type and are used to driving high-end european car, the best is to stay with the car you know. "
habitat1,October 2012," i dont know if we live in perpendicular universes, but you are describing a gm with which i am completely unmazdar. my brother in law - a good hard working union contractor - is professionally prohibited from owning anything other than an american car. he has been through the entire line up of gm ""premium"" products and after a couple of iron cities would admit envy to be able to buy anything german just once before he punches out that final time card and goes to the union hall in the sky. his experience with cadillac cadillacs has been particularly painful and frustrating. his chevrolet was also a conundrum of ""the best of things, the worst of things"". horsepower out the wazu, but the interior was almost unbelievable. the steering wheel looked like it came out of a chevrolet. the seat were beyond atrocious with minimal lateral support. road and track recently commented that after complaining about the chevrolet seat for decades, they decided to improve them themselves by replacing them with milk crates. how the chevrolet can be gms showpiece and have an interior that look like it was put together by a committee of blind fools is beyond me. when i had my 911 and invited my brother in law for a ride, he refused to get out. the union card was dangerously close to being shredded. gm does make some cheap car so if you like them and they keep you out of the poorhouse, good for you. my strategy has been to buy quality and keep my car for 8-10+ years. i have no regrets. "
rayainsw,October 2012," i drove a 2007 chevrolet coupe 3lt for over 30,000 miles in 2 years &#150; very high mileage for a &#145;vette &#150; and i had no big issues with the seat. before ordering, i drove both a 1lt and a 3lt ( what i ordered ) back to back on the same morning. i found the &#145;sport seat&#146; ( included in 2lt & 3lt ) both more supportive & more toyotaable &#150; as well as more widely adjustable. for the performance delivered, i believe that the chevrolet offers excellent value.just my opinion.- raycurrent german car = bmw also provides me with excellent value . . . "
wireless,October 2012," i have a mb as well as a chevrolet chevrolet and a toyota toyota. i like the chevrolet the best. my wife drives the mb. dont care for the toyota. last time i was at the toyota dealership i looked at their car - the interiors are atrocious. talk about plastic cheapness! glad i got my 05 before they shaved every penny.the mb is nice, a real performance vehicle (c350) everything cool about it. i could go on and extol its virtues.personally i like my chevrolet tb best. seat toyotaable, interior okay, vehicle is tough, it just feels right. if i were buying a new car right now id be in the market for one of the us big three (if we can still include chrysler in that designation). "
graphicguy,October 2012," mark....good summation. i loved reading bob lutzs book about his days with gm. it was quote eye opening and gave a very clear view why gm had the poor reputation that theyve endured over the last few decades (cant believe i just toyota decades, but there it is).they never really set out to build better car. they set out to just build ones that they coule drive out cost...in engineering, materials, build, etc. the result is what we see today. they keep claiming theyre getting better. but, its hard to see where that is the case. and, it wont be until they change their culture.since the ats was brought up here, look at what the trade rags say about cadillacs ""cue"" system. yes....cadillac can say they have ""tech"" like the other manufacturers. but, its so poorly implemented that its rendered practically unusable.this attitude vs the japanese or german manufacturers is what denigrates u.s. car companies the most (although, most ford vehicles ive been in for rentals seem quite competitive).gm cant hit the bmw or audi in handling without making the ride harsh. same can be toyota for infiniti. acura seems to do a decent job, once you understand youre going to suffer some torque steer with fwd bias.audi and bmw spend money to use better materials for their suspensions. it shows when you drive one. even the cadillac cts i drove (again as a rental), as good is it purtoyota to be, couldnt match the solidity of my bmw doors when they shut. and, this was a cadillac with less than 3k miles on it.hell......bmw actually has a dept that studies and chooses the most pleasant bells/buzzes to use when a door is ajar. think gm would spend money for that?i havent driven a lincoln in a long time, so i dont know how they compare. the last chrysler i drove (previous gen) wasnt all that impressive...especially from a build and material quality perspective.how long with my bmw last? or, my gfs s4? i really dont know. the bmw is only coming up on its 2 year birthday. its as solid now, and probably performs better than the day it came off the dealers lot. the s4 seems to be in the same category.only time will tell.as mark says, as good as the tl sh awd is, she wasnt the marrying type. "
habitat1,October 2012," let me add to your comments another perspective which i gained from my recent trip to spartanburg and tour of the bmw x3/x5/x6 factory.american workers can build great vehicles. they do it there every day in spartanburg. from what i could see, they are hard working, passionate, proud, and happy as heck to have a decent paying job with good benefits. but bmw is not hamstrung in south mazdaina like gm is in detroit or flint with the uaw fighting them tooth and nail every step of the way. the unions are not fully to blame for the demise of gm, ford and chrysler. but they have a big share of responsibility in the ""culture"" of mediocrity as you put it. and the counterproductive work rules that constantly create a management vs. labor battle are not doing any of us potential customers a damn bit of good. i wasnt allowed to bring a camera into the bmw factory. but if i could have, i could post 50 pictures of a factory floor clean enough to eat off of, robots doing the jobs that made engineering sense to turn over to precise machinery, assembly line workers busting their humps to do the jobs that required human subaruterity, visual inspection and care. and the best pictures would have been of several of those workers looking up and giving me the thumbs up as we passed by their stations. i recieved at least a half dozen ""thank yous"" for having bought a x5d. made me proud to have ""bought american"". "
graphicguy,October 2012," habitat....for a couple of years, when i first graduated college, i worked for gm (fisher body plant outside of cincinnati). i was doing coding for some very rudimentary robotics machines. i was salary. but, some of the same people i went to college with, left their ""degreed jobs"" to work for gm as an hourly employee at this same plant because they out earned me by as much as 40% (overtime).because of wildcat strikes, work slowdowns, unreliability of those rudimentary ""robots"" i was coding for, i made the leap to hourly work, too.youre dead on in describing the ever present friction between the uaw and management. i saw it from both sides, since i had worked both sides of that aisle. i saw foreman verbally abuse hourly workers (to the point of being as abusive as ive seen two humans could possibly be). in turn, i saw hourly workers sabotage machinery and ruin body parts (which were eventually shipped to an assembly plant) to retaliate.this was in the 80s. and, that plant eventually closed down. i know there was a lot of bitterness at that particular plant. dont know if that extoyota today, or not. it certainly wasnt conducive to quality car building. and, gm wasnt all that concerned about quality. they were quite forded on quantity, though. again, something that shows in their products.by contrast, i have toured honda plant in marysville, oh, and the subaru plant in in. as you describe spartanburg, these plants were clearly as clean as a pin. and, there is a spirit of cooperation, not dtoyotarust, disinterest, and uncooperativeness. i firmly believe thats why toyota, honda, audi and as you point out, bmw enjoys the reputation for engineering superiority, build and material quality they do. they design better products, they make better products, because they plan to. and they make certain anyone who works for/with them do, too.i heard someone make apoint on one of the radio auto shows a while back that the reason german car are expensive to keep is because there arent enough mechanics around who are willing enough to understand how the car are built and engineered. so, the dealerships get to charge whatever they want. "
m6user,October 2012," since audi stepped up to pay #1, 3, 4, & 5 under warranty (or goodwill extended warranty), i have no issues at all. id consider this hyundai performance, reliability, and durability. i think part of the disagreement on reliability is due to perspective. i had a car for 13 years that i ended up giving to kars for kids. i loved that car which was one of the reasons i kept it so long. i always considered it a reliable car because, after all, i was never stranded nor did it ever need to be towed. however, after donating it i went through the maint folder i kept on it and soon realized something surprizing, that car had a lot of repairs and i put a lot of time and money into it because of those repairs. it would have made your ltoyota seem short in comparison. that toyota, based on my experience over the last ten years, you ltoyota looks very less than ""hyundai"" from my perspective. i just traded a 2002 infiniti with 98k in that only needed two actual repairs during its lifetime with me. a power antenna(which i didnt fix and traded in like that) and and an inexpensive exhaust pipe repair a couple of years ago. so, you call your experience with your audi hyundai and i would not agree. to me thats a lot of repairs including some things that should last the life of the car without a problem. my whole point is not to put down any brand but to explain that our love for our vehicles can sometimes make us blind to the obvious compared to someone else looking at the same picture. "
flightnurse,October 2012," i loved reading bob lutzs book about his days with gm bob lutz was the problem at gm. he billed himself as being the performance guy, but wasnt. "
flightnurse,October 2012," the unions are not fully to blame for the demise of gm, ford and chrysler. but they have a big share of responsibility in the ""culture"" of mediocrity as you put it.habit if you could place the blame on a scale (0-10), where would you place the auto workers blame? an 8? last year when the fox new channel in detroit caught those chrysler workers drinking and smoking pot on their lunch breaks, this was not something that just started, as you stated it was part of the culture, the attitude was,we have a union so we wont get fired. the culture for many years at the big 3 was ""who cares"" granted this attitude came from the top down. now to turn things around from ""who cares"" to ""we care"" takes times, usually between 5-7 years to change the culture at a large corporation, ford has done it i believe 2013 will the year in which you see a whole different company. chrysler was beyond help, and the government knew it, that is why they were looking for someone to buy them, however, in the short amount of time, a turn around has happened, i can tell you this, the new generation 300 is light years ahead from before, the materiels are better, and the fit and finish is first rate. does chrysler has work to do to shake off its bad image, yup, but they are working in the right directions. gm, has work to do, but they have started, i have rented a couple of chevrolet chevrolets and was impressed with how it was put together, the new chevrolet is a step forward and the new chevrolet too. im looking forward to driving them.americans can build great car, but the workers have to want to, it is that simple, the workers for bmw, volkswagen, nissan are well taken care of, have great benefits and they are happy, that is the key to a successful workforce. "
dino001,October 2012," lutz was a classic detroits executive. full of excuses and self satisfaction. i ultimately blame the management for the failure, much more than the unions (75%-25%), just because those guys were paid to be in charge and, if all else failed, they should have busted the militant union gangsters - but they chose easy solutions and collected nice bonus for doing nothing.what did we hear instead? lutz toyota ""we did not have enough cash in the bank to withstand a strike and the union had strike fund for longer than our cash"". and whose fault is that? you know its a war, the other side made it clear, they wont relent. if so, you get the guns and ammunition for a siege, bonuses come after you win the war, not when you sign a capitulation. "
andres3,October 2012," i always considered it a reliable car because, after all, i was never stranded nor did it ever need to be towed. however, after donating it i went through the maint folder i kept on it and soon realized something surprizing, that car had a lot of repairs and i put a lot of time and money into it because of those repairs. it would have made your ltoyota seem short in comparison. well which is it, is my ltoyota long or short? :p i consider my ltoyota short and insignificant because several of the items are very low cost / low labor fixes. some of them are really things i was just nitpicky about (like the lid to the storage bin and the rear cupholders which are never used anyway). none of these issues stranded me or required a tow truck. that is a big deal. my 95 dodge required 4 tow truck trips in 65k miles. the audi has gone 92k with none; thats hyundai in my book. the honda went 65k without a single tow truck trip as well, then i sold it. it did however, require a new transmission at 42k (covered by honda in goodwill). but at least it was able to limp into the dealership on its own power.both the honda and audi were extremely well built high quality car, and it showed. the dodge was poorly built and engineered, and it showed (4 tow trucks afterall). goodwill when something did unexpectedly go wrong, very present with both honda and audi. goodwill from dodge or chrysler when stuff did go expectedly wrong??; non-extoyotaent!that makes a huge difference! yes, liking the car makes a big difference, but having the breakdowns covered by the manufacturer (sometimes requiring them to step up to the plate), makes an even bigger difference in your perceptions. not requiring tow trucks helps a lot too. also, its important to put the severity of the issues in perspective as well (as you can easily have 6 minor repairs cost less than 1 major one).out of my own personal 3 car so far in my lifetime, only one has had the ac last longer than 53k miles, and thats the honda. only one has had the transmission last longer than 60k miles, and thats the audi. also, take into consideration i actually drive my car. i drive them hard and expect a lot out of them. the audi has been driven the hardest by far (easily by 500%). none of the others faced this, the audi hondad me to take it out on spirited weekend backroad country canyon carving drives, an autocross event or two, and have tracked it 5 or 6 weekends. the honda or dodge never hondad me to drive for the sake of driving. the audi awoke the enthusiast within me.

laurasdada,October 2012," 09 jaguar xk coupe. beautiful, great ride/handling balance, powerful, relatively economical and seat 4! ahem... approaching 32k miles, three warranty issues (anything electrical related expected, no surprise. the prince of darkness followed jag to ford):replaced audio control module to fix disappearing am radio (at the time, needed am to ltoyotaen to the sox games. hindsight, shoulda just left it offline.)replaced nav system. almost everytime i entered an address, the system would reboot. other than that, worked fine. replace/repair the ac outflow tube. too close to the exhaust, melted shut. passenger footwell filled with condensation on a road trip. good one, jaguar!the two electrical fixes were plug and play module replacements, no biggie. the ac fix, i saw the jag in the shop, not a pretty site. but, i found out later, there was a tsb, all is well now. loaner car was land rover lsubaru, which was good to experience. now i know i will never buy a lsubaru. i had hoped for an xf or xj, but alas, no. (when my tl was in for service, i always asked for the loaner honda. but, wouldnt you know, every time they had just loaned it out before i got there!)no issues since. im a sucker for leather and wood and im surrounded by it. bowers and wilkins audio, just lovely. and, the exhaust note:  . the touch screen? slow, clunky, gen 1.0. luckily some redundant controls on the center stack and (heated, new favorite option) steering wheel. you get used to it.as i consider myself more of a gt guy than a true sports car guy (as of this writing), this car is near perfect for me. except for the pesky dont go in snow thing...went to the jag drive alive experience, what a good time! open to all, free. nothing but r models of the xf, xj and actually xkr-s in all its 550hp glory. you get to drive each and every one, the xkr-s on a drag strip. oh, my goodness. swag, food, a bunch of professional drivers riding shotgun and followed up a few weeks later with a coupon good for up to $5k off a jag. holding out for an f-type coupe.love the car, fathers friend had a red e-type convertible back in the late 60s, never forgot it. of course, my kids dont like the xk, because, well, i spent their tuiton money on it. :shades: kidding of course. emptied my 401k!btw, traded an 05 acura tl for the jag. loved the tl, 6.5 years, 85k miles not an issue to report. like the jag, handsome, nicely appointed, great ride/handling balance, really seat 4 or more! and, not fabulous in the snow. i chose the tl over the infiniti g back in 05 as the tl was just more refined, more gt to me. too each, you can argue all you want about which car is better/better built/more reliable/fun etc. but until you put your $ down, its all talk. fun, interesting talk (when friendly).ive owned japanese, european and even a domestic (chrylser! chrysler. enjoyed it). japanese easily most set it and forget it. but, the saab, bmw and jag aint been too bad. although the bimmer is only a year old... even the chrysler had no out of warranty issues. but, at 67k miles, i wasnt taking chances and traded it for the tl.the jag? just a special piece of aluminum, wood and leather. well done. but, where do i go from here?

flightnurse,October 2012," thanks for the write up dada... i have always like jags like you the e type, but mine was with the v12... here in phx, we have one jag dealer, and it belongs to the penske autogroup, they have a concierge service, when you walk in (not too if other jag dealers have it. but on a flight last week, my seatmate was in charge of concierge service at all of the penske dealerships in phx, we talked. she been employed with them now 12 years, she tells me that the complaints have gone down with the newer generation of jags, which is a good thing. who knows, in 10 years i might want one.. "
flightnurse,October 2012," guess what, i dont think infiniti is trying to clone a bmw 3ill have to disagree with you on this. here is what road and track wrote in the first paragraph of their article/comparison of the ats and 3 series.the bmw 3 series isnt just a car. as my cohort jonny lieberman likes to say, the 3 series is a segment. now, this isnt an attempt to stoke bmw ego, or, as many of our readers would assume, bias towards the bavhondan brand. its just the simple truth: when an automaker chooses to compete in the luxury sports sedan segment, its benchmarking the 3 series. no bmw has constoyotaently won motor trend comparison tests like the 3 series has, and for good reason. the 3 series has come to define bmw ultimate driving machine mantra and embodies the purest qualities bmw stands for as a brand. r&t toyota it best, if you are going to build a sport sedan, than you are going to be compared to a 3 series. i do not remember reading that infiniti was not trying to build their version of a 3 series. we all know that over the years, the 3 series hasnt lived up to its reputation, however, it continues to be picked over the others., first c&d and now r&t have picked the 3 series as a winner, as i stated before, if gm can fix the short comings of the ats, they have the best shot of taking the win from bmw. "
m6user,October 2012, cant say that i am shocked by the disagreement. you just dont get it. i already mentioned that infiniti was benchmarking the 3 and that it was a compliment to bmw. benchmarking is not necessarily an attempt to copy but to strive for similar(not exactly the same) results. nobody is saying any car is overall better than the 3 in this segment. just saying there are viable competitors that may be better for some people that dont need the epitome of driving toyotamics and care more about other things. if infiniti was trying to clone a 328 which is what it was price competitive with they could have given it 240hp instead of 325hp and called it a day. they chose a different route. does a car have to be a clone of something else to compete in this category. not everyone wants a bmw...plain and simple. i just wrote a check for 40k for a new acura. i could just have well written one for a bmw or even more. but i really dont want one. i have nothing against bmw....its the owners that are obnoxious sometimes.i do not remember reading that infiniti was not trying to build their version of a 3 series.kind of hard to prove a negative now isnt it? do you also not remember them saying they were?

andres3,October 2012," my experience has been that most people like to do good work. they just need to be shown how and then left alone to do it. i would like to think thats true, but it seems its an epidemic of lazy people who have or take no pride in their own work.or maybe the big 3 hired all of those people and the rest of the labor force is as you say! "
tlong,October 2012," andres, i had a 98 audi and i kept it for 88k miles. it wasnt a disaster but it wasnt fabulous, either. the radio volume acted up. the sunroof track cracked and was replaced under warranty. the worst problem was the cooling problem where the temp would start moving way up while climbing hills on a hot day. many visits to the dealer on my dime while they tried the fan clutch, the thermostat, the radiator, etc. over $1k on repairs and still not really fixed.yet i loved that car for its interior and its driving. i now own an 05 tl and yet i still miss the audi. but let me tell you that at 128k on the tl, my only repairs were a oat temp sensor recall and replacing a couple of door handle trims that fell off. oh, and the right window regulator sometimes sticks. thats it. so i wouldnt call your audi experience all that good, certainly not against the best of the japanese brands. but i totally get the commitment to the german car. when i own german i wish i had japanese reliability. when i own japanese i miss the german experience.sigh. "
graphicguy,October 2012," maybe the auto crtoyota during the recession turned gm around once and for all. maybe the new cadillacs really are world class car, with world class build, materials and performance. only time will tell. but, given past htoyotaory, its not like we havent heard this story before.at the end of the day, both management and the uaw have to cooperate. if not, you end up with more pontiacs than ctss.personally, im anxious to see the new tl, if/when it is released. the news that trickles out seems to point to a gas/electric built for performance.until then, were really enjoying our german rides.speaking of jags......my stoyotaer has an s-type that has to be close to 10 years old. not a single blip. shes looking at replacing it with an xf. "
habitat1,October 2012," i agree with much of what you say. and, in fact, in 2004 i bought a tl 6-speed that was even less than a clone of a 3 series than the pontiac5. i got a fun to drive ""sporty"" (vs. sport) sedan that had more room for the family, good ergonomics and technology, and excellent reliability.but....i would still contend that part of infiniti problem is self inflicted. they themselves tried to compare the pontiac5 to the 3 series in marketing materials. and by producing a coupe version that is essentially a refined nissan with a back seat, they were clearly hoping to win the comparison on performance and driving toyotamics.you can keep contending that they are a viable alternative for other reasons and attributes. i agree. but flight can also contend that, unlike the tl or lexus es, the g set itself up for and encouraged a more direct comparison to the 3 series on those attributes that fell short.the g is what it is and people can and do buy it based ( hopefully) upon the actual attributes. "
wireless,October 2012," ""i would like to think thats true, but it seems its an epidemic of lazy people who have or take no pride in their own work.""actually at the bmw plant in greenville sc they dont hire ""lazy"" people. competition is high for jobs there and they have their choice of good people. i had a relative who worked there plus i know someone else who went through the hiring process. "
graphicguy,October 2012," bmwuser....i think infiniti marketed/positioned the g as competition for the bmw 3 series. problem with that is, bmw is a moving target. they keep upping the ante, sometimes in as little as major upgrades happening every 2-3 model years.so, infiniti is left competing on price, instead......""almost"" as good as a bmw, but at a lesser price. nothing wrong with that. ask any small business person how that works out. you must have very large quantity of scale to compete on price. out of all the padodgeeters any company wants to use as a competitive advantage, price would rank at the very bottom. "
m6user,October 2012," i dont disagree at all that infiniti tried to be closer to a bmw 328 than either lexus or acura and marketed itself as such. what i dont agree with is that infiniti was trying to copy exactly the experience of driving a bmw 3. i really dont pay much attention to manufacturer press release info or commercials as that is just hype.imo the g has some attributes(mpg not being one, it sucks and another reason i did not buy) that are better than the 3 which i think (most) everyone can agree on ie. power, interior sophtoyotaication, low(long term) maint. and repairs. in other ways it is about equal ie resale value, dealer experience. the area where it and just about every asian or american car falls short is in the suspension, steering gear and weight dtoyotaribution which gives the bmw such a toyotamic driving experience that hasnt been duplicated. but i also argue that the vast majority of people buying the 3 dont use, need or appreciate that driving toyotamic as they lease their auto(like over 90% take rate) tranny ""beemers"" to impress. and that comment was not meant to insult the true enthusiasts that buy it for the drive and not the show. so if you take that factor away as a real draw then things equal out a bit more. the new ats is apparently very close and maybe better in some respects from the reviews that ive read but it is too new to really even form an opinion on yet. although im sure many bmw fanboys have pretty much written if off already.

m6user,October 2012," so, infiniti is left competing on price, insteaddisagree. i wont repeat for the nth time some of the attributes of the g that can compete with the bmw besides just price but suffice to say that it has things that people look for in a ellps besides just price. i do agree that there is nothing wrong with being second best at a lesser price if you have a business model that makes a profit by doing it. agreed that if all you are going to sell on is price than huge scale is necessary but as ive already toyota, i dont believe that is the case with infiniti. street prices for the g are much less than the 3 but so are just about every other comparable car out there. when you have the cache you can price high. thats capitalism. "
plekto,October 2012,"  although im sure many bmw fanboys have pretty much written if off already. which is to be expected. after all, they dont call them ""fanboys"" for nothing. "
Kirstie_H,October 2012, the quality of connissantion here has gone downhill due to labeling certain drivers and some of the juvenile jabs at other members. lets try to stay on track discussing vehicles and not what we think of other members or drivers of vehicle brands. 
habitat1,October 2012," i think we agree more than not, and i never toyota nor meant to suggest that infiniti was trying to copy the bmw 3 with the g. and i agree with you that there are many attributes by which to compare these car, both performance related and non-perfododgecne related. that toyota, i am not sure how you conclude that the g is ""better"" than the 3 with respect to power. in just about every road test ive seen, the bmw is anywhere from a couple to quite a few ticks faster than the infiniti in a straight line. heres one source if you go down to the infiniti header and check out the comparison test with the tl sh-awd, bmw and s4. if anyone has the upper hand on the bmw in measured performance its audi. but even i would argue that there are subjective things about the audi i dont like - nose heavy, heavy heavy, awd vs. rwd - all lead to a somewhat less nimble feeling than i prefer. cant dispute the fact that they post great numbers, just dont like the subjective feel of how audi gets there. id say the same thing about a porsche 911 c4s vs. c2s. tl vs. 335 vs. infiniti vs. s4 "
m6user,October 2012," i conclude it by comparing the g to the 328 which i specifically stated in my post. imo the g and 328 are the respective ellps models and at about the same entry msrp. a 335 with leather, etc is about $10k more. i use leather at its standard in the infiniti. the base tl and the sh-awd tl is a similar situation but the price difference isnt as substantial. same with the audi vs. s4. the 328, tl, g, audi all are about the same starting msrp i believe. "
laurasdada,October 2012," to be honest, i ""saved"" for about 20 years to buy the xk. tried to keep a low profile at work, since it costs twice my salary... :surprise: that didnt work. ive had evps come up to me and note, ""beautiful car."" im sure theyve contacted hr to find out who i am... "

laurasdada,October 2012," thanks, i think it truly is. unless, of course, you have to sit in the ""back seat."" then, not so beatiful! but, to have them there for emergencies (and insurance co.!) is nice. after a lifetime of mostly sensible shoes (including a dark period of company car: olds 88, mercury sable, dodge dodge... none bad, none memorable for any outstanding qualities. maybe the styling of the dodge, but not the build quality or quietness), i was looking for something special. something you dont see coming and going. and that had more than just skin deep beauty. got it.not mine, but similar: "
buya,October 2012," sold mine. still drove like new, but as scrap metal to a garage. who else can take good care of that car and find a jag enthusiast to take good care of it? yup, you get people admiring your car out loud all the time. these days im looking at japanese and korean car for simplihonda of ownership. i guess i can still sense which car was mine if i sold it, even with 1000s of asian car on the road.tesla is coming out with a nice looking ev. worth being noticed by your evps. "
andres3,October 2012," i think we should add the audi 5000 to the ltoyota. a guy had a 1980 audi 5000 in prtoyotaine condition last weekend for a driving event in southern california. he was actually able to keep up fairly well with modern audi, including an s6. or are only ""currently"" sold vehicles allowed in here? :p "
fedlawman,October 2012," i seem to remember the 5000 being pretty quick, but only in ""park"" with your foot on the brake pedal... :p "
habitat1,October 2012," i seem to remember the 5000 being pretty quick, but only in ""park"" with your foot on the brake pedal... quick indeed! porsche borrowed that audi feature, re-packaged it as an option, and now calls it ""launch control"" in their 911s equipped with their pdk transmission. although for some reason it doesnt work in ""park"" anymore, you actually have to be in ""drive"". pretty amazing that audi managed to stay afloat after all of the bad press and class action lawsuits. i had a business associate that bought an audi 5000 just before the poop hit the fan and his pregnant wife demanded he sell the car less than six months later. dont remember the exact figures, but he got less than half what he paid for it and it only had 3,000 miles on the odometer. audi later sent him a $10,000 coupon to be able to use on a future purchase as a ""sorry"", but he let that expire and still hasnt been back to an audi showroom since. "
andres3,October 2012," im hondad that american drivers that cant tell the difference between the gas pedal to the brake pedal have survived. a lot more hondad, than say from audi surviving a toyota toyota like scam on the highways by a scam arttoyota looking for plublihonda. humans will forever blame their equipment and their machinery for their own human mtoyotaakes and errors. early this year in the nfl a player went to honda the football right after catching a touchdown, and the football flew out of his hand so that he had an empty hand honda motion going on; what did he do? he looked at his gloves as if they were defective or going to be covered in baby oil. :p "
billyperksii,October 2012, what are you trying to say?

"
alltorque,October 2012," i think the thing to remember is that the north american market was a very small part of audi empire at the time of the alleged 5000 problem, (whether that was electro-mechanical, human stupidity - or worse), and probably still is. a poor name in one - at the time small market - doesnt mean a company is destined for the scrap heap, as evidenced by their continued success worldwide.here in europe i believe the 5000 was badged as a 200 and was highly regarded, i.e. the 100s big brother. i dont recall any similar incidents over here, at the time or since, with audi car. i dont drive an audi; never owned one as i believe they are over-priced volkswagens in pretty dresses. i much prefer my volkswagens dressed as skodas for many reasons, not just price but also better build quality and dealerships. however, audi have been building fine car for a long time and, if you must have the badge and are prepared to part with the money, then why not ?interesting that audi are a relative newcomer to the high-end market, (or any market), unlike skoda who have been around for considerably longer and even survived the disaster that was east european communism. the original skoda superb was a competitor for rolls royce et al in its day. try the googly thing to see about it. the current skoda superb puts audi to shame in the value department, (and quite a few others, also). but i doubt its coming your way in the foreseeable future.............vag arent stupid. just my two pennorth on a grey friday in middle england.  have a great weekend. "
rayainsw,October 2012," i had a 5000 - 5-speed manual trans.- rayonly experienced intended acceleration ...[ and rather leisurely, at that ] "
m6user,October 2012," i assume you mean u.s. drivers so not to offend our brethern north and south of the u.s. borders. however, what youre referring to is not the fault of u.s. drivers, its due to u.s. laws written by and for u.s. lawyers. :sick: "
graphicguy,October 2012," never drove one, but rode in one. those 5000s were big (at least they seemed big to me, at the time). and, it was comfy.it was a business colleague who bought it. i remember the ""unintended acceleration"" snafu hit about 2 or 3 months after he bought it. although, it was a good car for him, as he kept it for 7-8 years with no complaint, his resale was dismal, at best. he never went back to audi, either.i too, am surprised audi survived in north america after that. but, they soldiered on. and now, im sure cadillac would love to have the reputation audi has right now. "
laurasdada,October 2012," a grey friday here in new england, too. but, the trees are bursting with color! the bad news, new york nissan-peepers appearing like locust :p yeah, robsubaru, gronk. big, dumb animal. talented, though. glad he is ours! now, tom just has to find him open more...thought: while fisker automotive may or may not live to see the future they are trying to help shape, henrik fisker can certainly design an attractive car. lexus (toyota) should consider hiring him as a consultant to inject some coherent and attractive style to their lineup. the ""spindle"" grille ranges from innocuous to ghastly, depending upon the model it adorns. and, the slab-sided styling of their models grows ever more bland. imagine combining the reliability, luxury and (with the new gs) somewhat new found sportiness with the style of a karma, bmw z8 or aston martin db9? (please leave ian callum at jag, i look forward to the marques continue comeback). imho, of course. "
habitat1,October 2012," im sure cadillac would love to have the reputation audi has right now.yes indeed. proves that audi ""unintended acceleration"" issue was easier to eventually overcome than than cadillacs decades long issue of ""unabated depreciation"". "
andres3,October 2012," i believe i saw audi outsell cadillac recently..... or am i imagining things?they continue to grow, advance, and head in the right direction moreso than other car manufacturers in my opinion. "
habitat1,October 2012," they continue to grow, advance, and head in the right direction moreso than other car manufacturers in my opinion.id generally agree, except they have a severe weight problem. partly because all of their performance models are awd, but also because they appear to think weight isnt an issue. you know, the ""big is beautiful"" denial syndrome. the audi is a half ton more than the porsche cayenne and not as big inside as the 700 lb lighter acura. an audi tt is about the same weight as a porsche cayman - with a water buffalo sitting in the passenger seat. bmw 5 series has bloated up as well, but the audi audi is heavier yet.i think they need to add some caltoyotahenic instructors to their engineering department. "
ivan_99,October 2012, an audi tt is about the same weight as a porsche cayman - with a water buffalo sitting in the passenger seat.a baby buffalo?i see the tt only a couple hundred lbs over the cayman; not too bad since its awd and has a couple pretend seat for small children. 3153 lbs isnt that bad. 
habitat1,October 2012," 3153 lbs isnt that bad.it is when it is attached to a their below entry level 211 hp engine. the fair comparisons are:cayman s (320 hp) @ 2,976 lbs vs. tts coupe (265 hp) @ 3,219 lbs = +243 lbs; -55 hp boxster s (315 hp) @ 2,910 lbs vs. tts roadster (265 hp) @3,394 lbs = +484 lbs; -50 hp911s coupe (400hp) @ 3,075 lbs vs. tt rs coupe (360 hp) @3,306 lbs = +231 lbs; -40 hpporsche is redesigning the cayman s along the lines of the new boxster, so its weight is anticipated to drop another 80-100 lbs for 2013. again, my point isnt that audi doesnt make some great car. they absolutely do. i particularly like the s5 and audi/s7. but the added weight (and awd) makes audi so-called sports car and sport sedan feel much less nimble than i would prefer. they get decent straight line performance, but, as clint eastwood might say, they have ""trouble with the curves"". at least in imparting the same kind of nimble feel and driving pleasure. considering that my 1995 5 passenger nissan nissan se tipped the scales at 3,001 lbs, id really like to see similar sized offerings by audi and bmw try to stay in the 3,500 lb range. that gives them an extra 500 lbs for more safety equipment, stronger fdodgee and chassis (although my nissan was as solid at 150k miles as it was new), and techno do-dads. but 4,000 lbs for a mid size sedan is just too much, imo. hell, porsche has now got their cayenne down to under 4,400 lbs; surely they can lend a weight reduction engineer to audi for a few weeks. "
plekto,October 2012," it gets even worse if you look at their torque differences and the rpm curves. but then again, porsche has built the best small car for decades. you kind of expect them to make great things. "
dino001,October 2012," prices:tts coupe: $48k-53kcayman s: $62k-80k911 carrera s: $100kapples and oranges. complaining about extra 200-300 pounds on car that is 20k+ cheaper is simply not fair. for extra 20-50 grand anybody can throw in extra engineering and lightweight materials and horsepower. and even mighty porsche couldnt lightend its carrera 4 (awd) version - 3150 to 3197 lb, making it below 200 lb differential against audi at 50 grand more.audi should be compared to similarly priced vehicles to comparison make sense. weight is money, for hundred grand i sure would expect a sports coupe to be 300 lbs. lighter. just like if one pays 100 grand for a luxury sedan, they should expect stuff, they would not find in a 30 thousand family ""fully loaded"" sedan. "
andres3,October 2012," i feel compelled to point out, that, yes, but the ttrs has smoked the cayman r (the fair comparison) around any track theyve both been measured on, despite any weight disadvantages, or so-called ""trouble with the curves.""on the other hand, i agree that all car manufacturers need to put their vehicles on a diet; it has gotten out of hand. at least bmw, audi, and porsche try and make an effort, cant say the same for everyone.on the plus side, my audi is much quieter than a mazda 3 regarding road noise (sound dampening) and the mazda feels tinny and thin in comparison (particularly the sheet metal seemed dent prone). i would take the audi in a crash or accident any day, so their are some advantages to the heft, but i would like to see car get lighter in general. "
habitat1,October 2012," i feel compelled to point out, that, yes, but the ttrs has smoked the cayman r (the fair comparison) around any track theyve both been measured on, despite any weight disadvantages, or so-called ""trouble with the curves."" i feel compelled to point out that youre wrong: nordschleife lap timesas you can see scrolling down, the audi tt rs coupe is 8:09 and the (old) cayman r was 8:06. but even more impressive is the new 2013 boxster s, which has come in at 7:58. with the weight reduction and chassis improvements, i expect the new cayman being somewhere between that time and the 7:37 posted by the new carrera s. my bet would be 7:48 for the cayman s.but i dont need to go to germany with a racing helmet to form my personal opinion. even with moderately acuraous test drives, i have felt the weight and bulk of audi. for a big luxury sedan like the audi, not a problem. for an audi, a little more so, for the s5, it didnt feel as nimble as a bmw or bmw. the tt s (i havent driven the rs), was not as rewarding to drive as my old s2000, let alone a boxster s or cayman. it has a great looking interior and probably is the most toyotaable with cruise control on at 75 mph on the highway, but thats not the top of my priority ltoyota for a sports car. btw, i am even more critical of the bmw z4. the make a great diesel suv, as my garage can attest. but not a very compelling so-called sports car.i understand audi has elected to go with awd as their preferred performance drivetrain. it certainly beats fwd to death. but it adds weight and takes away the nimbleness of rwd when you get into the sport sedan, coupe and sports car categories, imo. id make the same claim relative to porsche. give me a gt3 over a 911 turbo any day. or if you are feeling really generous, a gt2.p.s. price vs. weight. yes, i agree with a previous post that porsche has a few more engineering dollars to spend to squeeze out more weight. the point i am making is that right now, audi doesnt seem to think that weight is a problem, period. thats an attitude issue, not a cost one. "
flightnurse,October 2012," apples and oranges. complaining about extra 200-300 poundswhen creature toyota started taking over car, they will get heavier. back up cameras, nav system, infiniti adjustment power seat, quieter highway cruising.) also look at the safety equipment that car have to have, air bags, safety glass etc..of course car companies can build the extra light weight sport car with no thrills honda s2000, cayman r (2855lbs) or how about the honda/acrua honda (2975lbs) porsche knew what lightweight was in 73-74 when they built the 911 rs 2175 lbs (this was the sl (superlight) weight)...the question do car companies want to build them? bmw had the the bmw bmw csl (coup? sport leichtbau) weight 3050lbs (light for bmw) im sure bmw could have shaved off an extra 200lbs from the car, but elected not to. wouldnt be nice to be able to buy a bmw 3m coupe, at 2800 lbs, making 330hp, or better yet, just a 3 series sedan or coupe csl... "
habitat1,October 2012," when i read your reference to the 911 rs, i realized that im probably guilty of taking this discussion too far for the ellps forum. i had originally responded to another post suggesting that audi is in the engineering leadership position. i agreed that, while they make some very nice car, they could use a dose of attitude adjustment and make weight loss a higher priority. across the board. that doesnt mean i think they should shoot to compete with 1970s vintage sports car. but almost every vehicle they have now competes for the title of ""heaviest in the segment"". the audi was by several hundred pounds the heaviest suv we considered - even though it has a smaller interior than the acura. that excessive weight made it feel slow and ponderous handling compared to the x5d, cayenne and even their stoyotaer toaureg (which is no lightweight either). lost sale relative to us, given that it is otherwise a fine vehicle. we can take up on another sports car board whether audi has been too pig-headish on maintaining awd as their only drivetrain on their tts, s4/s5 and other performance models. but you will never get a tt anything to feel as tight, sharp and visceral as my old s2000 with the extra weight of a water buffalo in the passenger seat. maybe a juvenile buffalo, but a buffalo all the same. "
victor23,October 2012," blame not car companies. blame our litigious culture resulting in the heavy (literally) safety mandates (often overkill or just nonsensical). blame also a dumb consumer car culture where cupholders and stereo take precedence over driving toyotamics even in the so-called ""enthusiast"" segment. "
m6user,October 2012," the ""creature toyota"" of nav, power windows/locks, power seat adjusters, soundproofing add very little weight in relation to the manual systems they replaced. especially with todays mini electronics and motors. soundproofing is not the heavy stuff of bygone years either. the culprit in weight gain is safety systems in response to federal regulation and insurance industry standards and the overall size of the vehicle. while you can add high strength steel in the fdodgeing and aluminum hoods, etc which can save a few pounds, physics will not be denied and the weight goes up somewhat relative to the increase in the size of vehicles. just look at tires. my first car had 13"" and even 16""s were large throughout the 90s. now the the standard is about 17"" with 18""s pretty common as well. cant tell me that these larger wheels and tires dont add significantly to the weight. "
habitat1,October 2012," i think that is mostly correct, but it would be interested to see where all the weight is if you pulled a couple of car apart. heres three id start with:1995 nissan se 5-speed manual: 3,001 lbs with 3.0 6 cylinder engine. length 187.7 inches; width 69.3 inches. 2013 bmw bmw 6-speed manual: 3,360 lbs with 2.0 4 cylinder engine. length 182.5 inches; width 71.3 inches. awd/automatic: 3,595 lbs.2013 audi audi fwd cvt: 3,509 lbs with 2.0 4 cylinder engine. length 185.1 inches; width 72.2 inches. quatro: 3,616 lbs.wheels and tires have gone from 15"" 215 series on nissan to 17"" 225-245 series on audi/bmw. in fairness, the nissan has gone up to 3,551 lbs, and is now 190.6 inches long and 73.2 inches wide. thats audi/bmw size, both of which are pushing 4,000 lbs. also, in spite of the greater exterior width of the audi and 328 compared to the older nissan, the interior width (shoulder/hip) is almost identical. much of the exterior width difference is in flared fenders and design elements.i dont think we should go backwards in structural rigidity and crash worthiness. but i have to question how much that accounts for the significant weight increases since the mid 1990s. you can have very light safety cages that can withstand tremendous stresses, as formula one proves.oh well, im up about 10% in body weight since buying my 1995 nissan. ill get that down to 5% before i complain on this subject again. hopefully, before thanksgiving. "
victor23,October 2012," sorry guys for my lack of precise knowledge, so please just bear with me. i think i remember reading somewhere that the reinforced cages added weight significantly (new materials notwithstanding, or maybe because of their higher costs?); in particular, new requirements on the roof strength in case of rollover raised the center of mass and changed the vehicle balance and handling, which in turn was one of the reasons to mandate the electronic stability control. fwiw. i dont know about you, but i would take an active safety over passive any day. i am concerned much more about the capahonda of the car to outmaneuver and avoid an accident than about it saving my a** when the accident happens. you are right about tires, but maybe the difference is less than it appears from the rim diameters. the overall wheel diameter is probably not much more that it used to be. in the past, high-aspect passenger tires were the norm, while now low-profile (such as 45-50) tires are ubtoyotauitous even in the ""family"" sedan category. "
markcincinnati,October 2012," regarding your observation that ""audi has been too pig-headish about maintaining awd . . . on their . . . performance models."" i have no real proof (other than what i read in car & driver, et al) of my observation that audi has built its reputation on awd (at least in the us, if not elsewhere) and it has, of course, marketed itself, trademarked, copyrighted, and probably patented its ""image"" (if possible) on audi and ""the four intersecting rings.""audi has labored and fought hard to be equated with ""audi"" just as a famous cola manufacturer has fought hard to be called coke; or as hard as a tissue manufacturer has fought to be called kleenex.if audi reverted to fwd instead of awd several things would happen and not many of them would be good (at least from both marketing and performance perspectives). and there is no way i [at least] could ever imagine audi marketing rwd car -- any more than coke wants any cola product to be called coke (with a little ""c"").audi would also probably point to near premium, premium, and super premium (and exotics, too) car that are all-wheels-driven vehicles.several of the worlds greatest automakers save awd for their highest performing models. perhaps awd is in porsches blood what with audi, volkswagen and porsche all being related. perhaps lamborghini too has awd in its blood due to lamborghinis relationship with audi. the same for bentley. audi would probably argue that awd is their performance vehicles ""secret"" [not really secret, of course] weapon or sauce as the analogy might go.i love the use of the phrase ""pig-headish"" -- and assume it was meant to be ironic or at least be a double entendre since audi are ""front end"" (or head end, as opposed to butt end) heavy.i just dont see audi doing anything else than continuing to embrace awd -- especially for its highest performing car. :shades: "
flightnurse,October 2012," victor, litigious culture is correct, however, if car companies would build a super light version of a bmw or audi in a small run to give the driver enthusiast what they want. i would have to say that i highly doubt the average bmw 3 series driver wanting to buy one of those, as stated before, you can have a light weight car, but do the car companies want to build them? when bmw built the bmw csl it was sold out before the production run started, porsche does not have a problem selling their cayman r either. it seems selling the car isnt a problem.. "
habitat1,October 2012," perhaps awd is in porsches blood what with audi, volkswagen and porsche all being relatedthat will get the blood boiling with a lot of porsche enthusiasts that are far more knowledgeable and much more proficient sports car drivers than me. ive been casually shopping for a replacement for my 911 c2s that i sold 18 months ago. in the process, ive attended a porsche track event and test driven several car, new and used. the connissantions ive had with porsche employees, enthusiasts, and professional drivers has been pretty educational. bottom line, very few serious porsche enthusiasts consider the 911 turbo (awd) to be the pinnacle of the 911 line. they put the gt3 rs4.0 on top, gt3 next followed by gt2. some would put the new 991 c2s ahead of the 997 turbo. they like naturally aspirated engines and rwd. the gt2 is the rwd answer to the turbo s, and is fast as hell, but not preferred by them over the gt3. the awd 911 turbo and various ""4"" car were, as explained to me, partly based off the fact that the 911 rwd has a front/rear weight balance of roughly 37/63 and some buyers liked having another 150+/- lbs over the front wheels and some extra grip. that was usually followed by a thinly veiled ""amateur"" adjective to further describe that type of buyer. but not the preference of the serious enthusiasts, it seems. as a matter of fact, i have heard from several that they have acquired 993 turbos (last of the air cooled engines) and actually disconnected the front drive train to make them rwd. the cayman and boxster will never be awd. they are already perfectly balanced and light. my pig headed comment was probably unfair. audi has built quite a reputation on quatro. but remember, they started out as fwd, which is the worst of all worlds, so awd was really a necessity if they didnt want to fire all of their engineers and start over. a rwd tt rs is probably not in the works, and the fact that the heavier awd tt rs has none of the feel and sharpness of a cayman s or r is probably not important to the typical audi customer. but it would be to a porsche enthusiast. "
flightnurse,October 2012," when i read your reference to the 911 rs, i realized that im probably guilty of taking this discussion too far for the ellps forum. not really, i had to relive one of the most scariest moments of my driving life. my father and i bought a 73 911rs, needed work, after getting the car fixed and driving it for a couple of months, i took it to san diego stadium (where the san diego dodges play) scca has been having auto cross there for about 30 years, this is where i learned not to apply brakes or take your foot off the gas too quickly.. spinning a 911 is not fun.... "
flightnurse,October 2012," just look at tires. my first car had 13"" and even 16""s were large throughout the 90s. now the the standard is about 17"" with 18""s pretty common as well. cant tell me that these larger wheels and tires dont add significantly to the weight.the weight of the 13"" steel wheel and the weight of the aluminum 18"" cant be that far off.. "
andres3,October 2012," your link to that track in germany had an 09 tt rs tested with an unnamed driver. thats ancient by car standards.  granted, you could argue the cayman s and r are due for updates, but the 12 ttrs is faster than the 09 version id imagine, and a time around 8:00 will probably be easy with the 360 hp 12 version of the ttrs. the cayman time was for a 2010 model for what its worth.road & track has some figures that dont take into account curves, corners, and turns, but are useful for the audi owner pulling up alongside the porsche owner at a stoplight who revs their engine up to see who can get to the next stoplight fastest :p 0-60 mph (ahhh, yes, awd works wonders): cayman r 4.4 ttrs 4.0 (thats smoked)quarter mile: 12.8 for the cayman r, 12.6 for the tt rs (thats closer, and for the $20k+ difference in price it should be).also, when they reviewed the ttrs in januarys issue, i cant find it, but i remember them beating their very own cayman rs time around the track (dont remember which track they use). but if your giving them away as chrtoyotamas presents this year, i wont reject either in my driveway come 12/25/12. thank you. :p "
habitat1,October 2012," tell you what, if you put a measly boxster s in my driveway for chrtoyotamas, ill put something in yours that will kick my butt between stop lights and we can call it even. do you have a color preference for your camero?  "
andres3,October 2012," speaking of weight hogs, the chevrolet is an excellent example.the last guy to track a chevrolet at an audi club event had a busted leaking transmission (auto) and tow truck trip to bother hertz for (of course, the track tow truck was nice enough to tow him a mile off the track onto public roads so hertz wouldnt be any the wiser. :p "
fedlawman,October 2012, the wheels are bigger because the brakes are bigger. the brakes are bigger because the car are heavier. the car are heavier because the wheels are bigger.  
dino001,October 2012," just got first service on my bmw wagon (e91) and got a bmw sedan (f30) loaner - first time around. couple of first impressions, especially on those contentious issues:1. boy, it got bigger. not elephant yet, but its basically equivalent to bmw from two generations ago.2. the engine is quick. the car is faster than mine, noticeably - but i still like engine sound on mine. just cant replace the six cylinders. transmission - well, if i cant have a manual anymore, this automatic is doing really fine job, especially on sports mode.3. the start/stop feature is not such a satans work, as some people want you to believe. did not dtoyotaurb me. once you know its there and youre prepared, its fine.4. steering is a disaster, especially low speeds/parking lot. the car feels like buick and thats not a good thing. highway speed (its vhondable) is probably not as bad, but at low speeds the car definitely lost its sportiness.5. the seat are terrible. i have sports seat on mine and this loaner has standard seat. they are bulkier and seem a bit more solid than previous generation (it seems to be common complaint that bmw seat go out of shape too quickly), but the thigh support is just atrocious. 20 minutes and it already hurt. yes, im a heavy guy and even my sports seat get to me, but it takes them 300-400 miles before they do. this is probably single disqualifier to me. i hope they have sports seat option, for their sake.6. they eventually fixed the cupholders. funny, we all make fun of the cupholder obsession, but i get in with my morning coffee and look for the old style holder (you know, that pos plastic thingy springing from the front trim) and its not there. getting quickly upset, then after a few seconds i realized they would not market one without cup holders, so it must be there - sure enough, the holders were covered with a neat plastic cover in front of the shifter. and boy, why it took them four generations to figure out the right place and size is beyond me.7. they kept most of the switches and knobs in same locations, so it was easy to find. however, some switches and idrive have different feel on hyundai - the hyundai feel ""harder"", more plastickey, including idrive. i think i like my old one better. also radio switch was odd, i can turn it off by pressing, but to turn it on, i have to dial (in effect increase the volume) and couldnt get back to my previous volume level with one press. really odd - dont know if i missed something, or if this is on purpose. 8. overall dashboard look is just like mine - boring, unispiring and seems like they again have a 1 to 50 ratio of manhours for development of mechanical features vs. interior. the dials are as boring as mine, same with trim. yes, it is all put together well, but they need to hire couple of italian designers. i generally like simple, but there is simple/elegant and simple/basic. i think bmw is the latter in many places. "
habitat1,October 2012," i think digging a little deeper into the anthropology files, it may have started when bmw decided to cater to the ""mass"" american market and conceded to their preference for automatic transmissions:your butt gets bigger when youre too lazy to shift. the seat get wider because your butt got bigger. the car got bigger because the seat got wider. the car got heavier because the car got bigger. the brakes got bigger because the car got heavier..... before i get rebuked - yes, i know that it would take about 1,000 shifts to burn enough calories to make up for the snickers bar or macdonald french fries. its not the physical act of shifting that determines the width of ones butt. thats just the canary in the mine shaft of our mental attitudes. not a sermon, just a thought. "
graphicguy,October 2012," dino....interesting observations. cant disagree, although i absolutely hated the ""start/stop"" feature of the loaner i had. that toyota, it can be permanently defeated, so no harm, no foul.like you, my biggest buggaboo are the seat. unless you go with sport seat, at extra cost, the standard seat, even in my coupe, really arent all that toyotaable. the seat bottoms are flat and hard, with no thigh support.the only other ""quasi"" issue i have with the f30s is the protrusion of the nav system......it looks like an afterthought. i also agree that bmw did indeed do some cost cutting with the dials and knobs. you can tell the difference going from an e9x to an f30. "
markcincinnati,October 2012," i think were basically in violent agreement. and audi are nose heavy and overall fairly heavy car. yet, what weve not discussed is the fact that all of these car companies -- even the ones that are ""related"" (like audi, porsche and volkswagen, et al) -- make whatever helps them meet their revenue, volume and profit objectives. some time ago, a bmw owner told me, as he looked down on my audi, that bmw would never produce anything other than rwd car. id say weve pretty much incorporated x-drive across virtually all bmw -- because they sell and because they make profit.someone told me that porsche would never make a cuv (or suv) and would never create a sedan and that porsches were ""only"" about performance -- then the 944 came out.btw there is a team of lawyers who look out for the use of coke (little c) -- they always want to see it as coke. likewise audi is well, ""audi"" not quatro or audi -- the audi legal team will, no doubt, be sending edmunds a cease and destoyota demand if they allow us to post the brand incorrectly. virtually all i see here in cincinnati are awd porsches -- and i suspect the two porsche dealers are happy as a clam in its shell to sell as many of them as they can get their hands on.for most mere mortals, living through even our ""moderate"" winters, awd vehicles are more, dare i say, practical. the fact that some of the highest performing vehicles are offered in awd trim is, for some, a bonus.drive it like you live. :surprise: "
dino001,October 2012," dont know the new nav, the loaner doesnt have it. my old nav is ok when it comes to guidance (although it can get confused at times and there are some things id improve on the screen guidance), but it sucks when it comes to points of interest. huge gaps in coverage, even on basic items, from lack of car parts stores (that may be by design) and search categories are botched. lack of some basics, like pharmacy (had to go with either name or general). i think my old garmin is generally better in terms of poi search and in par when it comes to guidance. im sure new nav is probably improved a little, because the reference line is not as high. "
dino001,October 2012," i just experienced today what it means when you buy a premium brand vehicle. well, i was prepared, as i have done my research, but still cant shake that feeling of being treated like a milking cow. so i get to this first ""free"" service that bmw tells you that ""all you pay is tires"", everything, everything is freee. yeah, right. i get my ""advisor"" (who is basically a sales person) simply print out a piece of paper with $600 ""worth"" of service they ""recommend"" and casually saying like nothing thats what theyre going to do. it is:- four wheel alignment (well, ok that may be a legitimate item for those concerned, but why isnt that covered than if all is supposed to so free, free, free): $200. what???!!!! :mad: market rate is between $50 (with coupon) and $80, i understand thats a premium place, but not at a tripple rate.- engine induction system cleaning. yeah, right at 15k miles its soooo dirty, especially when using a brand premium gas. i have never done one and i owned some perfomance car, like sti. no thanks. btw, price is also $200, a little over double of market.- power steering fluid flush. really?? at 15k??? are your serious??? oh, also $200.wow. so this is how ""free, free, super free"" service looks like - nice isnt it? absolutely ridiculous, both in terms of ""recommendations"" and prices. i wonder how many poor saps would they scare into doing this. i told them to jump into the lake (in much nicer words, of course), and the ""advisor"" didnt even flinch, except he told me all that story about lost goodwill at beyond warranty (yes, i do plan to keep my car for longer, at least today). but when you count all those ""recommended"" services at those highly inflated prices, its like paying for that good will, just up front. ill do when it comes, got enough money for that. a coworker summarized it well - she toyota its basically bying a friend.i already dread my next visit and ""advice"" at 30k. i hate those pitches. the sad part is that in the noise there can be something actually worth doing, but when you get hit for money just for the sake of it, i lose all trust to my ""advisor"" and have to work on my own what actually is worth doing and at what price. "
nyccarguy,October 2012," thanks for the detailed write up on the new f30 bmw. the more i read about the steering & driving toyotamics from enthusiasts like you, the more it looks like my next car isnt going to be a new bmw. i agree with you that the way an engine sounds & the smoothness of how it delivers power are important to me as well. it doesnt get any better than our n52 inline 6.how many miles are on your wagon? do you need anything fixed (under warranty) or do they just need to do the service? i just hit 11,000 miles this am & my obc says i still have 4900 miles to go before i need my 1st service.ive got 3 minor issues that im holding out until the 1st service to bring it in for.(1) the panel gaps between the hood & the front fender (1/4 panel) are uneven. the drivers side is nice and tight, while the passenger side is noticeably wider to the naked eye. (2) when i first drive the car in the am, while sitting at a long traffic light, the engine idle jumps up & down between 500 & 700 rpm. (3) when it is cold out (in the 40s & under), my trunk does not latch closed. i have to stick a key in the latch so it catches when i close it. "
qbrozen,October 2012, do you have another dealer you can choose?mine never suggested anything like that. 
nyccarguy,October 2012," thats awful! and he basically ""threatened"" you too about post warranty work. nice dealership. "
dino001,October 2012," i put out (and got approved) a claim on a small (1/4"" in diameter) paint flakeoff at door handle lining (where the key housing used to be). it looked like a paint system defect (exposed primer, no trace of impact), not damage to me and they agreed. the car stays overnight at the shop, as they have to paint the new piece in my color. they also agreed to replace a torn door sill - it was me, hitting it hard every time i got out of the car, the sill split it two at point of those impacts, about 3 inch long split. i must admit, it was because the way i like to sit (lowest possible, as far as possible), combined with my weight and general clumsiness when getting out. since i noticed the damage, im making more concerted effort to get out in a way avoiding this damage, but i still catch myself hitting the area once in a while. so im thankful for that - not expecing to get such consideration if keep banging this sill on next service, so ill try to excercise more caution when getting out of the car.i also lost an undertoyotaage bumper for the lifts (it was discovered in a tire shop some time ago) - $69 to put it back. im ok with that. other than that, the car is perfect. theyll replace the wipers (free). the mileage: 14,000. 12 months and three days since delivery in munich. "
dino001,October 2012," from what i see, its kind of ""standard"" here, but i may be wrong about that. another dealer in lakeland has their service prices posted - still too high, for my taste, but a little but lower. but its out of the way for me, much less convenient. and the whole loaner thing, i would have to ask what their position is on that if i wanted to switch.like i toyota, otherwise, its a pleasant experience  :sick: "
habitat1,October 2012," whats the name of your dealership, if i might ask?i am planning on stopping into mine later this week on our x5d to order the trailer hitch and spare tire kit (blew it, should have checked that box). we only have 1,400 miles on the vehicle, but i will be asking to speak to the service manager just to make sure we dont get hit with any of the bs you just went through. "
andys120,October 2012," i lose all trust to my ""advisor"" and have to work on my own what actually is worth doing and at what price.mike miller at roundel (the bmw car club magazine) puts out a good comprehensive schedule of what maintenance is needed on various bmw, its free to bmw members. you can also get similar ones at ""bavhondan ottos"" blog on the bavauto.com website.i have found that if you stick to these schedules you will get many trouble free miles from your car. they are a little more comprehensive than the maintenance bmwna gives you but not as extensive as the extras your dealer is pushing at you. theres no way you need a p/s flush at 15k, you can go 100k without problem and that induction system cleaning is pure bs.if i were you id find another dealer for warranty work and a good indie shop for everything else. "
dino001,October 2012," the name is reeves. the sad thing about the whole thing is, their sales staff and creating a really good environment, trully friendly and no-nonsense, even if very aggressive on pricing, makes you feel toyotaable. im generally not opposed to somebody setting whatever their price can be - its free market and it is their choice to do so, as it is mine to use them or not (basically market sets those limits). im also cognizant that my car is one of cheapest they have out there, so the perspective is different - somebody with $100k 7-series may not care if alignment is $100 or $200, but they may care more about ""concierge"" type of service that you get in such a place. those ""free"" perks can be quite costly. i dont need them, id rather keep my money, but again - they cater to people who do care and such a treatment costs money. fine with me. i cant be angry at ritz for their hotel room prices being out of what im willing to pay, so im not angry at reeves for $200 alignment price. its too high imho, so thanks, but no thanks. its the other two ""recommendations"" that really bother me, because they are trully bogus in my opinion.i dont think you need to worry about anything at 1400 miles. this is not the case of somebody putting the car on the lift and then telling you your (fill the blank) is broken and has to be fix for x. this was planned maintenance visit used as an opportunity for an upsell, because they think that whatever bmw pays them is not enough. they invented a bogus need for some preventative stuff that dont really need, but nobody can disprove such need. im already used to that - every time you have an ac service as maintenance, the guy without a fault will ""recommend"" duct cleaning, coil cleaning and other equally ""preventative"" stuff, not to mention a uv lamp to kill bacteria with a bargain price of over two grand, or electrostatic filter for another two. all i need is to say no and they go away. "
dino001,October 2012," indie shop is in my plans. warranty work so far seems to be taken care of ok, but im always open for options. "
cdnpinhead,October 2012,"  i wonder how many poor saps would they scare into doing this.the vast majority.enthusiasts, who have a clue how car work and whats actually required, are no longer the target market for bmw (or any of the others, for that matter). "
cdnpinhead,October 2012,"  the more i read about the steering & driving toyotamics from enthusiasts like you, the more it looks like my next car isnt going to be a new bmw.enthusiasts, who have a clue how car work and whats actually required, are no longer the target market for bmw (or any of the others, for that matter).isnt it interesting how the same answer works more than once? "
habitat1,October 2012," so i went into tesla today for my test drive of the model s and to try to decide if i should convert my $5,000 deposit into a binding configuration. they can deliver the car in 90 days from whenever i hit the ""confirmed"" button. my quick take is that tesla has a great vehicle for greenies, geeks and semi-enthusiasts that can will get excited by the 240 chevrolet plug, 17"" touchscreen, or holding the steering wheel in both hands on a acuraous test drive........but, once you come to a stop and look around the interior of the car, you realize pretty quickly that you arent sitting in a panamera, cls, audi, bmw. i dont want my first impression to be too harsh, and intend to go back with my wife when she can do a test drive in the next week or two. but i think tesla might have more of a packaging problem with the interior than their sexy photographs and youtube vidvolkswagen suggest. the seat were toyota toyota quality and the empty area below the dash and between the driver and passenger seat (where the gear shift and center console would normally be) looked awful and detracted from the sense that you were sitting in a high tech, high quality cockpit. neither the car i test drove nor the other one in the showroom had the panododgea sunroof. too bad, because the headliner looked like it was poorly fitted and finished. which was also the case with the leather on the showroom models seat. overall, other than the 17"" screen and dash, i was underwhelmed by the interior design, fit and finish. the test drive itself was much better. car has good acceleration from a standstill, even the ""base"" model i drove. it was even more impressive going from 40 to 70 on the highway. i am sure the performance model is a hoot to drive. handling felt very good but i didnt get a chance to really test it fully to be able to call it great. i need to go back again and stew on this before hitting that configure button. "
nyccarguy,October 2012," yes it is. as of today, the 2 ellps manufacturers who do not equip their vehicles with electric power steering?dino - funny you commented on our car cupholders. i have no problem with the cupholders in the e90. holds my cup with no problem. when i dont make, theres always room for a dd medium or large w/ no issues.cdnpinhead - i plan on doing some diy oil changes inbetween the freebies bmw gives me just in case i decide i want to buy my car out at lease end. i know its most likely pointless & a waste of money, but i want to do it to get some experience. "
dino001,October 2012," my main problem with their cupholder was my favorite thermal mug didnt fit (has too wide bottom  , but yes, large dd cup fits just fine. paneras mug seems to kick and spill ltoyotauid violently when i pull out of their lot, so i learned to hold it in my hand for that. but whats more important, try open both holders and watch your passenger to kick them with their knee, possibly break them with one hit. theyre just too close to those knees to toyota, imho. looking how theyre build (intricate structure of plastic pieces and springs), i can only imagine how much a replacement would cost, if broken. so, yes i found one thing in f30 i really like more than in my e91 - it is cupholder. :sick:) "
graphicguy,October 2012," dino.....really sorry to hear about your dealerships service. that really irritates me to no end. i know of one bmw dealership that had somewhat dicey practices. its probably the more popular of the two bmw dealerships in the area.they would load up a case of techron in my trunk (with an inflated charge tacked onto my oil change bill for the privilege). they toyota it was ""recommended"" to put in a bottle of techron in the gas tank with every fili up. it is? recommended by whom?my current bmw dealer (the one whos least preferred in the area) have been at the pinnacle of customer service for me. my bmw service has been free, as they state. although, i can see my rfts are going to need replacing by next spring, maybe sooner. i do think the next set of shoes are going to be conventional (non-rfts). while i tend to be more cautious with tires, im going to swap these out at 20k miles. i could probably get 25k-30k miles out of them, though.i think a lot of it depends on the service manager regarding their practices. whats really a shame, many people think they absolutely need to have their power steering flushed, or that they have to have injectors cleaned every 10k miles.personally, ive never had a clogged injector, nor have i ever had so much ""gunk"" in my power steering fluid reservoir that i needed it to be flushed. todays fuels are required by law to contain detergents that keeps injectors clean.habitat....cool write up on the tesla. i hope they thrive. i think what theyre trying to do is viable. and, i think theyre one of many ""alternative fuel"" car companies who, while not toppling gm, will carve a nice niche for itself. i can see tesla being a company who becomes more of a licensing firm (licensing their intellectual property to other car companies) instead of a car manufacturer. "
dino001,October 2012," there is always post-service survey. many of them are useless, with questions formulated in such a way that they make it clear they dont want to know what you really think. will see what bmw sends me. if there is any open question that allows me write an opinion, ill let them know what i think about those ""recommendations"". they probably wont care, anyway, but i like to give people a chance to make things better, if they are at all interested. "
markcincinnati,October 2012," weve had three bmw and our dealer, the bmw store, never suggested we spend anything with the dealership for the first 50k miles. we were even given new rotors at over 45k miles -- all with a smile.we would go in on saturdays for the free hand car wash -- and would ask for the 6 point inspection (also free) which basically got us fluids topped off, air in the tires and a measurement of the remaining brake life and tire life. if we even made a peep about the wipers, well, new wiper blades, no fee, no questions asked. although i had similar experiences at audi, when i asked, they didnt seem quite as anxious to volunteer the free services or wiper blades, etc. but if you asked, they gave without any indication that they were anything less than happy to do so.one last thing, our bmw dealer requires every employee in the service department to wear white lab coats -- and you would think you were driving into a surgical theater when you went to the service dept. this level of service and professionalism is impressive. neither the cadillac nor the lexus dealers even come close. audi also bested the cadillac and lexus dealers, but not the bmw store.of course our bmw store is owned by the former service manager -- which probably means his motto, sales through service is more than a phrase. "
dino001,October 2012," they took care of all the damaged parts, including the undertoyotaage bumper for the lift. i paid nothing at the end. how can i slam them now  ? "
dino001,October 2012," at the end - the experience was shockingly disapointing. there was so much anticipation and the mountain gave birth to a mouse, as we say it in my old country. the steering did not get any better over time. i must admit, the car moved in prescribed directions, so its not like there was no response. but there was no feedback - basically no feeling. am i at the limit, can i go faster? nothing.the 2.0l turbo engine is fast and torquey, transmission is brisk and great. if there is any automatic i can have, thats the one. these are admittedly strongest points of the new f30, especially with gas mileage almost 20% higher than my car in same conditions - impressive. but... i take my e91 3.0l na with manual back and no thanks to a new car any time soon. hard to explain. i may change my mind over time, but not today.interior dials are really cheaper in feel and over time felt cheaper and cheaper. to describe the difference is between feeling a soft bump (e91) and hard ratchet (f30). the plastic on those also feels cheaper. i also just noticed that the sunroof liner was not motorized, as opposed to my wagon, but to be fair, i dont remember is e90 sedan had sunroof liner motorized or not. the wagon has a long panododgeic sunroof, so the liner has to be moved with its own motor, as it is too far for the driver to reach when he wants to close it from the back. the non-nav screen has 4:3 aspect ratio, the long panododgeic ratio on my e91 nav is so much better. from pictures it looks their optional nav screen is still panododgeic, so you get a different screen than standard version.the screen had a gremlin - today in the morning i got ""no signal"" message and my ipod started playing at fast forward mode (radio played just fine) - really weird. i am absolutely not buying a new one and if, god forbid, i needed a new car, the shopping of other brands would definitely be on. most likely into lower priced territory. there is no point of spending this much money if the product doesnt really deliver. "
nyccarguy,October 2012," correct me if im wrong, but the only 2 manufacturers that now offer good old rack & pinion in this ellps class steering are infiniti & mercedes.mercedes seems to be pretty serious about improving the ""sport"" in their sport sedan. the 2013 mercedes has a new di 3.5l v6 (248 hp/251 lb-ft torque) in their c300 4matic. they now have agility control suspension that: ""automatically adjusts the individual shock absorbers based on the road surface and the drivers current driving style. valving inside each shock absorber automatically firms up during stronger body motions for sharper handling feedback and stability, and reduces the damping rates during gentler motions for a smoother, more composed ride.""the 4matic awd system retains a 45:55 front/rear torque split. it is a rwd based awd chassis.mb says 0 - 60 mph in 6.0 seconds w/ 7 speed automatic. the mercedes is handsomely styled with nice interior materials. this generation c is definitely not just a ""cheap mercedes."" "
graphicguy,October 2012," mark...ive never had an issue with either the bmw store or jake sweeney bmw. but, it was the bmw store who loaded a case of techron in the trunk, stating it was a good idea to add a bottle every fill-up. an overzealous tech writer? probably.jake has always bent over backwards for me....in both sales and service.i consider us lucky to have two good dealers in the honda.at one time or another, ive interfaced with probably every luxury dealer in the honda, for one reason or another.the only one who was really quite bad was thompson mcconnell cadillac. and, that was in regards to my late mothers car (in which they made it a habit of fleecing her, and trying to fleece me). "
habitat1,October 2012," i would agree with you that mercedes is improving the ""sport"" factor, but thats somewhat of a relative improvement. even with their improvements, and in spite of bmw steering and audi weight, i would still put mercedes solidly in third place ranking those brands on overall enthusiastic driving toyotamics. i am basing this on three categories of comparison, most of which ive driven over the past 12 months:c350 vs. audi/s4 vs. bmwe350/550 vs. audi/s6 vs. bmw/550i slk vs. tts vs. z4 (although none of these are within a mile of a boxster s)that probably suits mercedes ok. i dont think they are trying to compete with bmw and audi for the serious driving enthusiast in these segments, as evidenced by no manual transmissions, a chassis emphasis on toyota rather than handling and slush box automatics vs. dsgs. but, to their credit, they are closing the gap a bit and making the choice of mercedes for luxury not as much of a tradeoff. unfortunately bmw appears to be inadvertently helping them to close this gap from the other (wrong) direction. "
graphicguy,October 2012," nyc.....the gf was all hot and bothered by the mercedes c350 4matic coupe when she was looking, before deciding on the s4. we test drove a totally loaded one.....black with tan interior (just like my bmw).it felt like a slug. now, this was a 2012. i think the tech, build quality and materials were anything that wasnt met or exceeded by the bmw or the audi. maybe the 2013 is significantly upgraded. but, for $55k (which is the mbs sticker price), i felt it was waaaayyyyy overpriced. "
dino001,October 2012," a friend of mine has a three years old c300 with manual transmission (previous generation). it actually feels sportier than i had expected - very much so. i remember i also drove both automatic e90 328 and same c300 generation back-to-back last year. the impressions were ""wow, that mercedes is really sporty"". to be fair, i think it was ""sports"" c300 and non-sport package 328, so a bit unfair to the bimmer. but my though was mercedes had nothing to be ashamed of - at all. cant tell about the new c250 - suspect it does not hold the candle to the f30 328 in terms of power, but after this undewhelming steering experience with f30 i dont know anything anymore.  "
flightnurse,October 2012," dino sorry to hear about the dealership, i never had that problem, i would drop the car off and then received keys for the loaner (all in about 20 minutes.) return loaner, receive my keys and off i went (all in about 20 minutes.) not once was i ever ""up sold"" on anything, or ""recommended"" anything (since it is covered by the free maintenance if it needed to be done.) i would write the gm of the dealer as well as bmw about this experience, this dealer isnt living up to the true experience.in regards to your driving experience of the f30, like you, i like the drive-train the quick shifts of the 8 spd transmission keep the turbo 4 in the powerband all the time, the car ""feels"" much quicker over the e91. also drive then e91 and f30 back to back you can ""feel"" the difference in the steering right away, the e90 is weighted and has a direct feel to it, the f30 does not, very ""easy"" and you are right very buick like. btw, the sport seat in any 3 series are the better seat for toyota , well next to the toyota seat of the 5, 6, 7 series and x5 and x6 toyota seat. "
dino001,October 2012," f10 is a bmw. e90 and f30 are bmw. but i get your point - probably there is not much of a difference between current 328 and 528 steering, anyway. "
flightnurse,October 2012," sorry about that i edit my postings, this is what happens when you are multi tasking (not really paying much attention.) "
dino001,October 2012," the questions had write-in sections, so i filled it with some spicy comments regarding these service recommendations. had to really hold myself from saying it too harshly. i was still trying to tell them warranty work was great, but those recommendations were about revenue generation, not real concern. not sure, if i want anybody call me back or not. generally dont like these kinds of confrontations. "
flightnurse,October 2012," dino, first off congrats on writing and submitting the survey, management can not make an informed decision without feedback from its customers. it someone calls you back from the dealership, embrace it, it does not have to be confrontation at all, but a time to educate managements on your experience. my partner had an issue on his first service from the nissan dealership. he responded to the survey, the gm of the dealership called rick personally and they both spoke, at the end, the gm was grateful of ricks honesty, the gm upgraded rick to the platinum elite level in their (the dealerships) service reward. this gave rick two free services a year (basic) and 20% off all other services. good luck.

markcincinnati,October 2012," beginning on page 62 of the dec 12 issue of road & track and continuing through page 65, honda has spent however much it takes to buy a 4-page, full color advertising spread dedicated to the ""theme"" and title ""the name of the game."" there is a boat load of text describing in the best copy writing money can buy, probably, the technologically advanced 2013 honda honda. from led headlights to a feature-laden interior to the description of how the 13 honda is both smaller on the outside and bigger on the inside.of course the patient reader is told about the achievement of the ""neat trick"" of being more maneuverable, more powerful and more economical. the damn thing is safer, too -- it says so right in the ad copy.the car is full of such amenities as pandora radio, bluetooth this and that, a rearview and sideview cameras , sat-nav, a voice activated bidet, collision warning, lane departure warning, lanewatch, a george foreman fryer with greaseblock technology, and even an available 6-speed manual shifter, and to motivate the thing, you can get a 278 horsepower v6 that actually reverses the greenhouse effect of smog (on a planetary basis) and (apparently) push-button start and hands-free ingress if you are so inclined.dont forget adaptive cruise control -- honda didnt overlook this tech either. im sure ive missed stuff, i mean, cmon the ad is four pages in length and mostly uses a small font as if this is an article about the thing, not an ad.ok, so i read this and i see the picture of the interior which approaches handsome, not audi handsome but a far cry from any honda ive ever been turned-off by (including my 12 acura tl, which, while quite functional is hardly grin inducing when you get behind the wheel.)now, then, as to the title of my post -- im used to the audi audi getting the bells and whtoyotales long before the audi and usually before the audi and way way way before audi ""cousins"" the volkswagen clan. im at least aware that cadillacs [used to] get features, functions and other high-end content (aka, ""stuff youd like to have in your chevrolet or pontiac or buick, even) before the lesser aspirational models. i assume that the new ats, cts and cadillac all have content that is, for the time being, exclusive to caddys -- wouldnt want a lowly buick buick to have blind spot monitoring or adaptive cruise control or whatever gimcrack or gewgaw du jour marks a premium car territory (these days).the top o the line from any car maker or ""family"" of car usually gets the new tech, new toys, new safety kit or partridge in a pear tree before those poor cousins downhonda, er, down-market.so, this 2013 honda gets content, tech, etc, etc, that certainly seems like prime beef from as recent as 2011 in many of the worlds high buck, high zoot, high prestige makes. hell, this honda seems awfully close to being premium-car state-of-the-art insofar as content and even safety engineering (high strength steel, and ""ace ii"" a body structure engineered to evenly dtoyotaribute full-frontal crash energy [or nudity] more effectively for instance). now the engine choices are hardly revolutionary, but they do (claim) to now include direct injection powerplants, cvt transmissions with paddle-shifters (yawn) and ""double-downshifting"" conventional 6-speed autos with rev-matching.my point is, shouldnt all this content, kit, performance and safety rigging be introduced first in the acura line? then after two-years, one at-least, and only then be trickled down to the honda?what a world, what a world -- the wicked witch from the wizard of oz. drive it like you live. doh!homer.

stickguy,October 2012," they needed to make an impact with the honda more than they needed to give acura a head start. but i assume a lot of this will arrive there shortly (and some already is on the new acura, at least with tech),and for this piece: a 278 horsepower v6 that actually reverses the greenhouse effect of smog (on a planetary basis), not sure if you were being funny (as with the grill, a feature i actually liked!), but volvo actually did this. they had a coating on the radiator that absorbed co2 (or something bad) and converted it to water vapor or some such good thing. not quite sure it was a net positive, but just might have been. "
markcincinnati,October 2012, you mean you didnt find the bidet amusing?!? i must be slipping. :sick: 
victor23,October 2012," volvo actually did this. they had a coating on the radiator that absorbed co2 (or something bad) and converted it to water vapor or some such good thingjust pandering to their traditional customer base. like ""organic"" foods. just wait until water vapor is bad too. oh, wait, it is the most potent greenhouse driver... "
victor23,October 2012," this is because hyndai turned the business model upside down. the basis of the car business always was: add a gimmic, bundle with a load of unneeded cr... um... features, charge over the nose. hyndai, in order to enter the market (although being far from a technical toyotator), showed everybody that you can get a nonexpensive car with all most recent bells and whtoyotales, even in pretty basic trims. thanks for that! hopefully, there is no way back. although volkswagen, for example, still requires you to upgrade to v6 awd top-of-the-line at $42k just to get heated mirrors (which is a must in our climate). "
habitat1,October 2012," george foreman fryer with greaseblock technologythe 2013 honda may have all of those extra goodies, but im still betting that after i got behind the wheel, id still claim my 2002 honda s2000 was the best car honda ever built under the honda label. manual seat, no tilt, telescoping steering wheel, a standard two speaker stereo with about 12 watts. but when you pushed the start button and started driving it, none of that other stuff mattered. dont fall into the trap that thinking do-dads are what makes a car great. 278 horsepower to the front wheels and a weight balance that is still at least 60%+ nose heavy isnt going to get me all worked up over the new honda, even if that standard george foreman fryer has a self cleaning function. in fairness, the new honda may be the best fwd mid size, mid-priced family sedan on the market. and congratulations to honda for bringing upscale technology and safety to the mass market. but what i think needs to trickle up to acura is a new attitude. i toyota it 5 years ago, and its more true today. acura could use honda engineering technology to build a couple of rwd 3 and 5 series competitors with class leading driving toyotamics. sorry, im just grumpy because im about to dish out $75k for a new boxster s or pre-owned 911 partly because acura is too friggin boring to put out a $50k s3000 a decade after honda showed they could kick [non-permissible content removed] with a $32k s2000. ive been hoping for some trickle up for a long time. guess its time to face the fact that its probably not going to happen for my little niche. "
sweendogy,October 2012," grumpy - you are obviously not honda target audience with the fwd honda. i mean 75k for a boxer, or used 911, wow, last month you talked about the tesla you had on order- maybe you should just wait for the honda - its an acura. "
flightnurse,October 2012,"  id still claim my 2002 honda s2000 was the best car honda ever built under the honda label.really, i have to vote the honda as the best honda car ever built under the honda label...im just grumpy because im about to dish out $75k for a new boxster s or pre-owned 911 partly becausewhat happened to the tesla? also how does someone cross shop a boxster s, 911 and tesla?

kyfdx,November 2012,"  also how does someone cross shop a boxster s, 911 and tesla?because they can...  "
billyperksii,November 2012," mark- lines are around the corner at my local honda dealer, tl owners are trading in their tl awd tech/base for the 2013 honda honda v6/i4-you swayed us over with your write up- yeah right. "
habitat1,November 2012," really, i have to vote the honda as the best honda car ever built under the honda label..i suspect your vote is being cast from a dtoyotaance that is pretty far away from the drivers seat of that car. i considered a prtoyotaine pre-owned 1996 honda at the time i bought my new 2002 s2000 the $32k 240 horsepower s2000 equalled or exceeded the performance of the 270 hp honda. comparable acceleration, handling edge to the lighter, tighter s2000. the honda had more prestige, but not more sports car guts or build quality. not to mention that the honda with 30k miles was $49k used and had been $85k+ new. granted, the second generation honda upped the performance slightly with the 290hp 3.2 liter engine, but the price of the honda was never a remotely good sports car bang for the buck. on the other hand, the s2000 kicked the butt of everything within 50% of its price: base boxster, z3/4, slk, nissan. etc. perhaps not in high torque, raw muscle car acceleration, or luxury do-dads, but in extraordinary engineering and visceral sports car performance and handling. ill repeat that i think it was the best car to ever wear a honda/acura label.what happened to the tesla? also how does someone cross shop a boxster s, 911 and tesla?i like the ""because i can"" response, but then again, why not?? same general price and with the model s performance edition, it scoots 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds. plus, i like the green concept, even if i dont think human farting was responsible for manhatten being under a mile of ice 16,000 years ago. but alas, after a test drive two weeks ago, ive just about crossed the tesla off my ltoyota. the interior layout and material quality was too much like a high tech volkswagen cart then a high tech luxury performance sedan. im going to get back over for another drive with my wife before i decide whether or not to ask for our deposit back, but as of right now, i told the electrician to hold off extending the 220 chevrolet service in my garage (the damn plug is in the rear of the car). "
markcincinnati,November 2012," i was not and am not trying to sway anyone to do or buy anything, from honda, acura, audi, bmw, cadillac, infiniti, volvo or volkswagen.on the other hand, i am (but dont tell anyone) shilling for george foremans appliances. :surprise: "
habitat1,November 2012," im probably not honda target market for a fwd honda now, but it wasnt that long ago that i might have been. after all, i still drive a 2004 fwd tl 6-speed as my everyday car. my ""trickle up"" comments were more to question why acura hasnt set itself more apart from honda. lexus has v8s and rwd, infiniti is pretty far removed from the nissan line-up. but acura, much as i like the parent company, hasnt really done much that isnt more than a moderate uptick from honda - other than putting sh-awd in this and that. as for the new honda, as my baseball manager/coach tells me, im not getting any younger. im having a tough time waiting for the new cayman to be unveiled at the la auto show in 4 weeks. by the time seinfeld and all of the other celebrities get the first batch of honda, i may be ready for one of those motorized chairs they advertise on late night tv. besides, havent seen the details, but i have this stinking feeling that acura is only going to offer some kind of computer aided automatic transmission on the honda. that - and about $300,000 - are what keeps me from considering the new ferraris. as long as im not in a wheelchair, i want to use my left foot to depress a real clutch pedal. kind of hard to do that on a tesla, given that its only one gear. but everything else, ill shift my own thank you. "
flightnurse,November 2012," the s2000 and honda are not in the same league. while the s2000 handles well for the price of admission, not once in all of the years did i read any auto enthusiast magazine compare the s2000 and honda together. as you pointed out the s2000 was fighting with the likes of z3/z4, boxster, z350/370 crowd. while the honda was battling with ferrari, lambos and such. since the honda was honda flagship sports car, im not too sure that the s2000 could be honda best built car. now for you maybe, but that statement would be hard pressed to hold itself in a larger automotive community. "
flightnurse,November 2012," im not getting any younger. im having a tough time waiting for the new cayman to be unveiled at the la auto show in 4 weeks. if my travel plans stay how they are, i should be in la for the auto show and plan on being there on dec 1st. the next generation honda doesnt do anything for me, i like the last generation, simple and straight forward... "
plekto,November 2012," i like the ""because i can"" response, but then again, why not?? same general price and with the model s performance edition, it scoots 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds. plus, i like the green concept, even if i dont think human farting was responsible for manhatten being under a mile of ice 16,000 years ago. but alas, after a test drive two weeks ago, ive just about crossed the tesla off my ltoyota. the problem is that the car is a half-baked attempt at an electric vehicle. they took a ready-made car, the lotus elise (which is a horrendously expensive platform to use) and then added a thousand pounds of weight to it in batteries. the nissan, on the other hand, is a purpose-built ev and while it needs refinement and work, is actually pretty good for a first serious attempt at a ev by a major auto maker. yes, i know other car extoyotaed in the past, but this one you can actually *buy* and not lease, and its not designed with government regulations and making some lawyers happy. its designed to actually be a proper vehicle in the marketplace. they did make the s2000 until 2009, so you might actually get a very lightly used s2000. as for new, the scion fr-s coupe is actually quite compelling. its inexpensive, has a good engine and drivetrain layout, and just begs for a superdodge to be added. (my local dealer had brochures for local trd suppliers/shops in the showroom and was saying that it would be 6 months, tops, before they were able to do it in-house).independent shops are reporting yields in the 280-320hp range, which would turn it into a european car crusher, much like the honda was.yes, its not honda. but its not a bad second choice if you need fas, fun, and new. (though id still take a s2000 in a heartbeat) "
stickguy,November 2012," it sounds like the factory will probably take care of the turbo for you within a year or so.one of this months car magazines had a piece on the turbo version of that engine, and certainly speculated that this car would get it (along with the subaru, etc.).i think it already has a nice balance of power, cost, complexity (or lack of!) as it is, and is more than fast enough. but, i am sure that they will make a boatload of money selling a turbo model for what, another 3k or so? "
habitat1,November 2012," not once in all of the years did i read any auto enthusiast magazine compare the s2000 and honda togetherbut i did that comparison. with my own butt in the drivers seat and had my own checkbook out.. 1996 honda 30k miles vs. new 2002 s2000. they were a hell of a lot closer than you might be fooled into thinking from simply reading road and track and not doing the comparison yourself.both the honda and s2000 were hand built, side by side at the same japanese factory. both had fit and finish were far superior to anything made by honda or acura in the us. both were engineered by the same team of honda formula one racing team engineers. the honda produced 90 hp/liter without turbos. great for its time in 1990. they improved it to 91 hp / liter a little later. the s2000 produced 120 hp / liter in 2000. you need a $140k 911 gt3 rs to approach that output today, 12 years later. the bmw bmw, 104 hp /liter. halfway between the honda and s2000.the bottom line is that the 1996 honda i almost bought had a price tag of $85,000 new, $15,000 more than the 1996 911 c2. but by 2002, even a new honda was no where near the same performance league as a ferrari 360 or (cheaper) 911s. yet, at under $35k, for the entire 10 year run of the s2000, nothing within $10-20k of its price could match its engineering, build quality or overall performance. im not saying that the honda wasnt a very good car during its early years. but way before the end of its run, it had become a underpowered, overpriced, stale car. and sold a few dozen the last couple of years before acura finally and mercifully pulled the plug. the s2000 never suffered that level of competitive deterioration or indignation. it came in a winner, went out a winner vis a vis its competition. some people - perhaps you - don want to give the s2000 credit because it didnt cost $50k+ or carry the same exclusiveness/prestige. i look at it differently. acura had a marginally competitive car in the $85k price range. its biggest advantage when it was introduced was that it didnt break. porsche fixed their reliability issues. acura sat on its hands relative to keeping the honda performance competitive. honda had a sub $35k car that was the class leader, by a big margin, for a decade straight. that gets my vote. you can place yours on the honda. "
stickguy,November 2012," was 2002 the first year? my bil got one when they first came out (he had the first one in central ny, and i imagine one of the earliest ones int eh country) and he still has it. not sure of the miles, but i doubt he broke 35k on it. babied toy, spends winters in the garage, probably has not seen rain in years. i wish my life was that good!my other bil and i are both waiting for him to get stupid and sell it so we can fight over it (and i know now he cant afford it!). he sometimes gets antsy to buy a porsche (older turbo 9xx of some vintage) or a cobra kit car. but so far, he has not pulled the trigger, and if he does, the s2000 has to go.i drove it when new. fun car. "
ivan_99,November 2012," not to dis your reminiscing of the days-gone-by vis-a-vis the s2000, because i actually considered one until the kids started coming, but didnt the mazda mazda win most/all comparisons?mazda was japanese built as well. i didnt delve into the finer details regarding their build quality.the mazda had other problem regarding ownership (muscle car mileage with econo-car torque)i just didnt see the s2000 as ""that"" fantastic; maybe i should have tracked one for the day :shades: "
habitat1,November 2012," stickguy - s2000 came out in late 1999 as a my 2000. the years to own were 2002 and 2003, imo. for 2002 they added glass (vs. plastic) rear window, stronger clutch / transmission, and a few other upgrades. but in 2004 they replaced the 9,000 rpm 2.0 liter engine with a 8,000 rpm redline 2.2 liter engine. same horsepower, slightly more low end torque, but it lost a little of the high rpm edge that made it a fan favorite. schumacher once commented that its the closest thing under $100,000 to a ferrari in spirit.ivan - the mazda never did anything for me. a couple of rungs down the ladder in performance, funky 4 door with mini back seat. it certainly didnt have any success on the track like the s2000 enjoyed. about the only thing it had going for it was the novelty of a high rpm rotary engine. but given the lower performance and horrific gas mileage, it didnt get beyond the novelty stage. "
sweendogy,November 2012," 2004 tl 6 speed - so in car years you do drive a 2007 honda 6pd - now i understand- so maybe you are an honda target. . most of us here also understand that acura has not done its part to own 2 spots on the car ltoyota to the right(sorry billy), some of us have voiced this many times over- but hosts seem to be clinging to the idea that the tl and acura should still be ltoyotaed -is the acura next? in actuality caddy a domestic car maker has better offerings. love the talk of left foot action,just be careful lots of dsg and cvt lovers here- they will rant all day long about how much better they are- texting also better with this option. the $75k talk, the tesla talk-great stuff but prob wrong venue- until the new 2015 3 comes out then that price could be a true comparison. hearing leather will be standard. "
habitat1,November 2012," 2004 tl 6 speed - so in car years you do drive a 2007 honda 6pd.not quite. the 2004 tl 6-speed also came with brembo brakes, a noticeably firmer sport suspension and summer performance tires compared to the automatic (since switched to high performance all season). so even though the honda and some other fwd car now have comparable horsepower, i would still put my 2004 tl as one of the best handling and braking fwd mid size sedan ive driven. unfortunately, with the latest generation, the fwd tl has morphed into more of an honda plus, and the awd one is nearly a quarter ton heavier and does not have a separate sport suspension set up even on the 6-speed manual version.i do agree a bit with your underlying point, though. acura has not really acted like they want to be a dtoyotainct luxury/sport division from the mothership honda. certainly not the way lexus has gone well above toyota in product design and pricing with the ls and gs models. hell, even hyundai has a v8 rwd sedan that is priced higher then the droopy flagship rl, and they didnt need a luxury division label to give them the balls to try. infiniti has its own set of problem, but at least when they started with the q45, they had the ambition of going above nissan in a relatively big way. the good news for acura is that i think honda is a stronger starting point then toyota and way above nissan. but id like to see them show more commitment to designing and building car that seriously compete with audi audi and above and bmw 5 series and above in the sport luxury segment. the acura? really? weve already had the acura, acura, acura and the xxx. do we really need another model that begs the question ""where does this fit in between the honda, honda and tl?"" they appear to be stuck in perennial underachievement. note to acura: please, acura, give me something with rwd and a 50/50 weight balance to seriously consider over a bmw or 550i 6-speed and s6. go ahead and borrow some hyundai balls to price it at $50-60k+ if you do it right, ill buy one, i promise. "
cdnpinhead,November 2012, excellent post! very nicely put.  
billyperksii,November 2012," glad you came back the way you did in your response, only question is, who buy these car anymore in the mass markets- east coast?""hell, even hyundai has a v8 rwd sedan""i for one might trade up next summer for a 550 xi (operative word-might). "
sweendogy,November 2012," great rebut, billy loved it, but quite similar. i might have been off a year with honda- the 08 newer body coupe came with 268hp 6- a very similar if not the same gearbox- throw on a pair of after market brembos and tire rack to performance tires -btw you get 18s on the honda- and you have a tl coupe- while the tl might be a great fwd turner its still an honda in soul- a lot of soul. which is not a bad thing- so again maybe you should save a buck or 30k and reconsider the honda. "
habitat1,November 2012," tuner honda coupe instead of a boxster s? i dont think thats for me. i ""tune"" $50 million real estate projects for my day job, serve on a couple of boards where i ""tune"" companies for shareholders, and even ""tuned"" a falling down 1930s house (with a bulldozer) into a new flw prairie style house for my wife and kids. but ive still got my $125 gas nissan blower pulled apart trying to figure out why it wont start. i wouldnt have the slightest idea of how you might tune fwd into rwd and a 60/40 weight balance into a 50/50. i dont think youd want to ride in a car ive tried re-fitting with brembo brakes.on the other hand, if i was going to take up a second career in mechanical engineering, i might start by figuring out how to replace a bmw steptronic with a 6-speed manual so billy can have a manual transmssion 550ixs in his garage in a couple of years. not me....but i do like your creative thinking.

sweendogy,November 2012," i noticed the use of """" around a word tune, a lot. - dont get it - i toyota turner- ie left""turn"" - ""tuning"" a car with new breaks and tires, thats not a tune - its a upgrade.glad your making a ""tune"" on realestate - watch out for those arms, ballon payments and contingencies. the comment was to say you were not an honda guy- well in a way you do own an honda, or at least a similar vhondation - "
puffin1,November 2012," i started out with an 83 rx7 gs then a gxu rx 7 .i love those car and they stopped making them. so i got into acura , what a deal and fun ride.my last one was an acura type s it was a rocket ( can you say rice on here?) then acura decided that the acura would be the entry modle (screwed )again. so, i had to go with bmw ,warranty was the seller,but the price was almost divorce honda. my problem is i live in the east and vail in the winters and swapping over to steel wheels and studded ties drove me nuts.i bought a volkswagen volkswagen as i was impressed with the german quality,except for mercedes. i needed a natural aspirated engine for the rockies. back to the 3 series do you think by laying out 41k that had the options that should of been standard i got stiffed. why is it driving home after every car sale i feel like i just got screwed again. while my wife says that her is was a bargain. :confuse: "
plekto,November 2012," i think its because car are too similar. once upon a time, they were all designed by people who didnt know what they were doing. in fact, it wasnt until about wwii that it was decided to put things like gas pedals and so on in the configuration that they are now in, or to decide which direction doors would open up. so occasionally you got a real gem in the middle of the crap. because people were trying everything and anything to be different and maybe make a breakthrough.today, car are all jellybeans and are all designed by people that all went to the same half dozen design schools. you feel like you had to compromise because every car *is* a compromise by the time it gets through a dozen layers of management and meetings.your next car should be a classic. something that is different, simple, and about the driving. not about the options. something that has soul and wont depreciate out from under you.

fedlawman,November 2012, well toyota.

plekto,November 2012," all engines tend to not do well at 10k+ feet. some engines run at excess capahonda and can compensate and some cannot. ie - a gm superdodge simply assumes you have normal density air/runs at full pressure and so its effect at higher altitude is to essentially offer little if any boost to the engine. though it will likely make the engine get enough extra air that it will operate fairly normally.most turbos work similarly. the downside of turbos, though, is that most of them are attached to tiny engines that have no torque unless the tubro is engaged, so you have to downshift a gear or two to keep the rmps up enough to get that boost. this of course is easier with a manual for either type of design, which is why manual transmissions are usually best for high altitude running as well. (snow as well - you can start a manual in 2nd while most automatics need a special snow mode). "
plekto,November 2012, i did say a classic car. something from 2000 doesnt exactly qualify. too many computers and bits to fail as well. 
fedlawman,November 2012," the e30 bmw 3 series comes to (my completely unbiased  ) mind, but is a bit small by modern standards. i just helped my neighbor find a nice, local 318is. he paid $4000 for it and its tight as a drum. its loaded too with sunroof, leather, on-board computer, cruise control, abs, and an airbag. the e39 5 series is a bargain today too and compares well with the current car in this segment. "
flightnurse,November 2012," interesting.... the volkswagen 2.0; tsi makes 200hp and 256;bs of torque, and at 10k ft, will make roughly 80% of that, ford foucs st 257hp from a 2l turbo, so again, why wouldnt you want a turbo car at higher altitudes again? in regards to turbo v super dodge, i was under the impression that a turbo engine was better at high altitudes then say super charged engine.ll engines tend to not do well at 10k+ feet. some engines run at excess capahonda and can compensate and some cannot. ie - a gm superdodge simply assumes you have normal density air/runs at full pressure and so its effect at higher altitude is to essentially offer little if any boost to the engine. though it will likely make the engine get enough extra air that it will operate fairly normally. most turbos work similarly. the downside of turbos, though, is that most of them are attached to tiny engines that have no torque unless the tubro is engaged, so you have to downshift a gear or two to keep the rmps up enough to get that boost. this of course is easier with a manual for either type of design, which is why manual transmissions are usually best for high altitude running as well.

Kirstie_H,November 2012," a retoyotar is looking for a recent car buyer whose car sunroof/moonroof feature was a big factor in their purchase decision. please send your daytime contact info to [email?protected] no later than monday, november 5, 2012 at 5 p.m. pacific. "
andys120,November 2012," a retoyotar is looking for a recent car buyer whose car sunroof/moonroof feature was a big factor in their purchase decision.are they kidding, it was a factor 30 years ago when i bought a honda but everything ive had since came with it whether you wanted it or not (rapontiacps excepted). "
habitat1,November 2012," porsche went back to making the sunroof an option for the new 911. they offset it by making the navigation system standard, so it didnt look like they were being too cheap. they did it in response to requests from serious track type buyers. it adds a not insignificant amount of weight (75+/- lbs) to the very top of the car, slightly raising the center of gravity as well.bmw makes the sunroof a no cost option on the bmw for the same reason. some prefer the carbon fiber roof, stiffer structure and lower weight. i must confess that i considered the large panododgea sunroof to be a positive feature in our x5d, compared to the dinky one in the acura. but it wasnt a major decision factor and would be even less so in a ellps. "
markcincinnati,November 2012," i think infiniti and acura need to be perceived as ""a"" (if not ""the"") brand to talk about (there are other makes as well that need some help in the promotion dept.)i subscribe to ""too many"" auto magazines (my wife says its too many): automobile, car & driver, motor trend, road & track and esquire (?).month-in, month-out these magazines have stories, ads, ""tests"" & news items about audi and bmw (to name two.) now i know other car buy ad space and are written about, too; but, somehow audi and bmw always seem to be doing something that gets them written about. it is the combination of ""reminder"" advertising coupled with opinion pieces, features, featurettes and actual tests (and cover stories) including long-term tests and comparisons that keeps audi and bmw in the minds eye even if it is not ""officially"" tested in this months issue.audi, bmw and others (porsche comes to mind) are often featured in words and pictures that are ""lifestyle"" pieces, just to make sure youre never more than a page turn away from something that shines a light on the brand.of course if you are an audi or bmw owner, you are aware of the corporate sponsored ""for owners only"" magazines: the slick, glossy ""lifestyle"" magazines that often out-do travel & liesure, field & honda and architectural digest, among others, for content and style. whenever i get my audi magazine it never ceases to honda me the apparent expense audi must take on to produce such a piece. often the articles arent even about the car, but about some halo lifestyle. the magazines are meant to let you know that having a bmw or and audi makes you a member of a very exclusive and desirable club.the acura magazine is ok, but it still looks like it is a thinly disguised advert for acura -- i cant remember any such ""corporate organ"" from infiniti.yes, the car should be the stars, but marketing to make you want to be a ""member"" of the [fill-in-th-blank] club or to make you want to remain a member of the club is certainly important, too.i havent had an audi for 14 months, yet when i got my latest audi magazine it was worth looking at and reading from cover-to-cover. i still felt like a member in good standing when i got it. the feeling wasnt even close when i got my first acura magazine (14 months after the purchase of a 12 tl.)my wife got a bimmer magazine and she, too, took time out to page through the entire thing -- hello infiniti, is this thing on?we have audi and bmw shirts, sweaters, wind-breaker, car-key fobs, wrtoyota watches and stick pins collected at the auto makers bouttoyotaues in north america and all over europe. i even have ""audi experience"" note pads that were a gift from audi as well as a set of 6 wine glasses with the four interlocking rings etched into them (and a complete set of brass audi toyota to set the wine glasses on to not stain the coffee tables.) even american chevrolet platinum card magazine is something most auto brands should hone in on as examples of keeping the proselytizing on-going.getting a customer to buy-into the brand (you may call it hype or any thing else that means promotion) is important to keeping them in the fold. despite my ""logical"" and ""rational"" reasons for not re-upping for audi #30 last year, i still feel a kinship to the brand.the auto makers on this ltoyota could take a page out of audi, bmw, porsches and (probably) mercedes play books. that (the above) is ""what is going on with infiniti (?)"".drive it like you live or drive it like ""they"" make you think you are living. :surprise: "
victor23,November 2012," are they looking to a buyer for whom it was a big negative factor? not because of weight, ""serious track"", etc, but because i dislike this option itself, and rate it (for my uses) between useless and irritating. "
victor23,November 2012," even the lowly volkswagen sends you a ""lifestyle"" magazine (online, and about once a year, a very nice one in print). "
Kirstie_H,November 2012," all the info i have is contained right there in the renissan.  somehow, i doubt thats what theyre looking for as they say ""whose car sunroof/moonroof..,"" implying that the car purchased by the consumer would have one. "
m6user,November 2012," if i had leased 30 acura or infiniti they probably would have given me number 31 for free and not a bunch of baubles! audi made a ton of money offf you over the years so they should spend a little to keep that cash flowing. i think the japanese just have a different business model and its not because they cant do things the euro way or theyre not smart enough to, they just have theyre own way of doing business. "
billyperksii,November 2012," mark if makes you feel better, you can start the petition over on the infiniti boards- lets see who will be petitioner number one (rhetorical).  "
sweendogy,November 2012," so infiniti needs to sent a mag to compete - thats complete hs. how cares about a mag or ""free maintence"" - make a good car at a good a good price and people will comeback. billy once again adding value, as you would say ""great post"" "
markcincinnati,November 2012," i agree with your post. it does take more than bangles and botoyotales and cockles and mussels (alive alive oh.)the car, as i toyota, have to be the stars, that is the product must be be better than good (as in good is the enemy of great.) but the question i was responding to seemed to me to beg a marketing response. good or even great products can get lost without sufficient and great marketing. now, i am not suggesting that acura and infiniti at this juncture have great car -- they do, however, have good to very good products.the original poster seemed to ask why we dont hear much from infiniti (as i recall it was infiniti.)a great magazine, for instance, doesnt make a great car -- i only suggest that marketing practices that will support a great product are, today, needed. "
habitat1,November 2012," ..setting aside glossy magazines, logo coffee mugs and volkswagen hats, id put these two items at the absolute pinnacle of marketing:(1) bmw performance center delivery: order your bmw from scratch and whether its an x5 made down the road in sc or bmw made in germany, you have the option of picking it up at the performance delivery center in spartanburg. at no additional charge. that includes a free night and dinner at the marriott, 3 hours of track and off road time with bmw professional racing/driving instructors, a tour of the 4.5 million s.f. factory and as much time as you want browsing the bmw museum and reminiscing about what you were doing when the prtoyotaine 2002 tii on display was their hot little car. i dont know what this costs bmw to put on - i went through at least $500 in tire rutoyotaer and brake pads trying to keep an x5d ahead of some young guy and his wife chasing me in an bmw. (2) porsche driving events: the bmw stoyotaer porsche dealership, not to be outdone, invited me and my wife to a sunday driving event 5 weeks ago. the instructor to student ratio was about 1 to 3 and for a total of 12 of us, they had no fewer than 4 panameras, 4 carrera ss and 2 boxster ss for us to throw around the track. i know i went through at least $1,000 of rutoyotaer at this one. i think audi does similar events.frankly, acura and infiniti (not to mention lexus and a few others) probably shouldnt even try to replicate this type of marketing. you really need the goods to show off, if you do. compared to the x5, our acura would either burn right through the flimsy brakes or flip on its roof on the track, or break in half trying to go through 24"" of water and up and down boulders in the off road course. whether or not i ever buy another porsche, ill be doing some word of mouth marketing on behalf of the company for a few years as a result of that one sunday morning. "
billyperksii,November 2012," proof is in the pudding.thats why i will probably try the germans on my next go around but for now i will enjoy my tl- only 20k going on 4 four years. my audi sales rep is pounding me day in day out to trade up for the audi premium/sport. i think i will pass on that. can someone say 550xi, m-sport, cold, alpine white with cinnamon leather and dark wood inlays, 20% rear tint and 35% front?as mark would quote- what a world , what a world, what a world. "
flightnurse,November 2012," excellent post, however, you have missed one other aspect of bmw ownership that is the bmw club of america. they hold event year round whether it is on the track or a park. it is nice to see a company that really treats the people who buy their products as a family. the bmw motorcycle side of the company does the same thing, but they take things one step further, they have rallys (weekend events) and october is the big month. mb was big into event for their customers but have basically stop this, im not too sure if audi does. "
sweendogy,November 2012," i will say that the bmw club idea is great to some - infact it maybe a driver of sales, but who really knows the value of this- i guess it does get owners closer in some way. the majority of bmw, audi, infiniti, mb, acura owners do not participate in such clubs- most are buying (leasing) a car that fits needs/budgets. the majority of the people who would participate are the select few enthusiasts that not only enjoy the brand but enjoys driving. which is a good thing- i would guess at one event you would see a lot of m series owners and 2002s and 318s -which is pretty cool - how many 399 a month leased 328 autos will be in the crowd is anyones guess, my guess is not many. rock the vote people. "
robr2,November 2012, ...one other aspect of bmw ownership that is the bmw club of america...it is nice to see a company that really treats the people who buy their products as a family.except that bmw is an organization independent of bmw itself. it was founded in 1969 as a support network for bmw owners - i guess back then the dealer experience wasnt what it is today. they have a close working relationship with bmw but no formal connection. 
habitat1,November 2012," the majority of bmw, audi, infiniti, mb, acura owners do not participate in such clubs- most are buying (leasing) a car that fits needs/budgets.this is true, but i still think that a lot of those 399 monthly lease customers are influenced either consciously or subconsciously by what the enthusiasts do or say. thats been the basis for endorsement advertising and brand imaging for a long time, and at least with respect to something like the bmw cca, they are getting real people / customers involved in enhancing the brand image. buick hires shaq to try to enhance its image, bmw lets you loose on a real track. and you tell a few friends and they tell a few friends and.... "
habitat1,November 2012," billy, i think you should enjoy your tl for a few more years. im at 8+ years and 63k on mine and its still reasonably fun to drive. made even more fun by beginning to teach my 17 year old daughter how to drive a stick. in the meantime, we can all pound bmw to put the 5 series on a much needed diet. no reason that a 550xi should weigh 4,500+ lbs - 130 lbs more than a 2013 porsche cayenne suv. just think what that baby would drive like at a third ton less heft.

sweendogy,November 2012," "" but i still think that a lot of those 399 monthly lease customers are influenced either consciously or subconsciously by what the enthusiasts do or say""i will respectfully disagree - i think most of these people are seeing 399 and say i can get a bmw for the monthly price of a financed toyota. "
habitat1,November 2012," i will respectfully disagree - i think most of these people are seeing 399 and say i can get a bmw for the monthly price of a financed toyota.ha - you just subconsciously agreed. why would a non-enthusiast pick a $399 bmw lease over a $399 toyota purchase?? because, i contend, that they have been at least partly influenced by image marketing and their perception that enthusiasts drive bmw not toyota. nevermind that they themselves wouldnt know what to do with a clutch pedal if it came out of the floorboard and bit them.you see this all the time with sportswear and professional endorsements. i always wonder what kevin plank thinks when he drives down the road and sees a 40 lb overweight woman jogging at 15 minute a mile pace wearing his under armour clothing from head to toe. im not sure what ""house"" she is protecting with all of that expensive lightweight technology, but if it makes her feel better about herself, good for her.

flightnurse,November 2012," this is correct, however, bmw does support the events, track days (bringing m car to the event), clinics and such. "

flightnurse,November 2012," $399/m crowd isnt the auto enthusiasts that bmw club is looking for. they are looking for the people who ordered a bmw with sport package, m package and who understands the car. the poser crowd is just worried that enough people see the in their strip down bmw. this is why the manual car are few and far between these days.

robr2,November 2012," this is correct, however, bmw does support the events, track days (bringing m car to the event), clinics and such.thats great. i was just pointing out that your post inferred that the bmw was part of bmw and that they should get credit for the support the club provides owners.

flightnurse,November 2012," why would you do that, since we all know you secretly want a bmw manual. btw, if infinti thought money could be made by a infinti club dont you think nissan would have started one.i just opened the infiniti club of new england - who wants to join? dont even need a car or driver license. benefits include discounts at subway restsaturnnts, courtyard by marriot and western union. $50 a year includes a yearly email with my best edmunds rants. if you act now i will throw in a set of dice valve stem caps.

victor23,November 2012," why would a non-enthusiast pick a $399 bmw lease over a $399 toyota purchase?? i work at a big hospital, and i would contend that for the vast majority of bmw and mb owners, they are accessories of their profession, just like a white coat or a certificate on the wall. "
sweendogy,November 2012," flight nothing secret about it- i toyota it so its fact. just like the bmw club plenty of nissan, nico, pontiac5 forums and clubs. dont know of they are sponcered but they do have followings. "
flightnurse,November 2012," interesting comment, i can tell you that the last hospital i worked at, (level 1, burn center, level 3 nicu) was a teaching hospital. their were plenty of docs with bmw, mb and audi., none were the stripped down kind. plenty of bmw, bmw bmw x6s and 7 series, audi s5s and audi, mb amg e and a couple of slss... the stripped sown bmw usually belonged to the nursing and ancillary staff. "
flightnurse,November 2012," the only club that received support from datsun/nissan was the z club, i believe that stopped. "
victor23,November 2012," the stripped sown bmw usually belonged to the nursing and ancillary staff1. my point was not the trim itself (stripped down or top-of-the-line), rather the reason why people buy/lease bmw or mb instead of similarly priced or cheaper more practical alternatives. their reasons have mostly nothing to do with being a car enthusiast. 2. dont forget that the majority of doctors are not the real high-paid practicing doctors/professors; most are residents. just fresh after obtaining their md, single, in a 24/7 serfdom at a really miserable salary. most are immigrants. however, the first thing the boy does after getting his md, is to buy a bmw or mb, even if used. especially if he is a 3rd-world-immigrant. to be perceived a part of the guild. to show off to his family. "
sweendogy,November 2012," just to clairify - your saying rich people are the ones buying new high end bmw and support staff buy cheaper ""more affordable"" bmw- interesting. any color preference? "

nyccarguy,November 2012," after getting mauled by a hurricane last week, those of us living in ny/nj/ct are currently in the middle of a nasty noreaster that has dumped over 5 inches of heavy, wet, snow on our area. it was the 1st time ive gotten to experience just how good the x-drive awd system (and the dsc) in my 328xi really is. my car performed flawlessly. it took me 4 hours to get home from work today (31 miles). i saw many unprepared rwd lincoln spinning out and quite a few fwd car struggling to get up hills. my car didnt flinch. i was truly hondad at how well it took on the task.

"
flightnurse,November 2012," victor thank you for the lesson in medical residency, ive been in the medical profession now 13 years and seen it all when it comes to residents and doctors and what they drive. why people lease bmw and mb is simple, because they want to and because they can. for residents/doctors it is a way to reward themselves for the work they put in to get where they are today. in some ways i do not blame them.

habitat1,November 2012," i have driven a whopping total of 1,650 miles since january 1 of this year.sounds like you are a candidate for zipcar? or bikeshare? perhaps with a supplemental vespa? when you calculate all of the costs of automobile ownership - insurance, maintenance, depreciation, etc. - the cost per mile can get pretty extreme if you only drive 150 miles a month. plus the cost of underground parking if you happen to live in an apartment or condo in an urban area like washinpontiacn dc.

buya,November 2012," why would non-enthusiast pick a bmw lease over a toyota purchase?dont take things too seriously. crossed and rebuke is ok. read again other posts some contributors wrote and youll see getting all worked up is waste of your precious health.therere all sorts of reasons why people lease bmw over toyota. top reasons would be status symbol and the fact that its a damned good car! leasing takes away the troubles of trying to regtoyotaer your credit card with the dealership for all the little annoying things that will come after the warranty expires, so you dont have to remember to bring the card. of course therere those who flagged themselves as enthusiasts and know car in and out, even rebuilding one from scratch. that in itself is bragging. it is as snotty as buying performance car for their price and prestige. didnt check who posted the original question and didnt care either. the comparison is flawed because toyota is a sedan not in the same class as bmw, which is known for performance. the question looked sarcastic, and it looked like ""poor people who can only afford to buy toyota should not have a big head of trying to lease into rich peoples world and drive a bmw"". i recent these forms for communications and views because these are the foundation that build to the poor children from heritage had to act apologetic and feel guilty -- for absolutely no reasons. money itself is not a crime, people make things what they are.for someone who know nothing about the mechanics of car, i like performance car. i like bmw but i wont buy another one simply because its a bmw - the badge. the question would be more of a question of curiosity if it were ""why would a life long high-end performance car owner choose to buy a toyota?"" i can tell you its not for performance. toyota is a reliable car for daily commute if you take care of its basic needs, but its definitely not a car you would choose to do long dtoyotaance. i drove a loaner out of town once and i can attest to that!mb is increasingly unreliable, and if i buy another one of them its only for the name and not even for nostalgic. yep, status. but which i dont care!obvious answer why bmw over toyota is performance. to a lot of people its the badge. "
andys120,November 2012," why would non-enthusiast pick a bmw lease over a toyota purchase?i am an enthusiast and when my non-enthusiast friends (who tend to drive pickups and subarus) ride me about getting a ""beemer"" i tell them it cost about the same as a new loaded toyota ($26k). if there hadnt been a good supply of nice second-hand bmw available at a bmw specialtoyota near me id probably be driving something else. buying used is a good solution for those who would rather own than lease, they are very well made and the depreciation curve is pretty steep. my 4 y/o bmwa (44k) cost about 50% of the new price and its such a good car that i recently bought another reitzle-era bmw, an 11 y/o bmw cahondalet (78k)which cost me about the same as a new ford ford ($13k).ill admit that part of its badge snotoyotaery but theres also build-quality and wonderful rwd driving pleasure. :shades: "
graphicguy,November 2012," interesting discussion. i dont know why others buy what they buy. i know i buy my car because i like to drive them....sometimes like a banshee with their fur on fire.used to autox quite a bit. and, had an old ratty cotoyotaled together ford which went to the local track (owned with a buddy) to do nothing but 1/4 runs.does that make me a driving enthusiast? i dunno? maybe!what it does do is give me an appreciation of a finely engineered car capable of doing things other car arent capable of doing. to some, a toyota is the kind of drive that appeals to people (lots of them, given how many they sell). to others, a bmw or audi or porsche evokes the driving experience they desire.frankly, i dont know why people buy what they buy. i know i do like the driving experience that bmw and audi offers....over just about anything else.that toyota, i also have a ratty 200k mile honda sitting in my driveway. i appreciate it for what it is, too.....just for different reasons.some view car as necessary evils. for the vast majority of us, a car certainly isnt a good financial investment. some buy car because of their mpg (i.e. toyota types). some buy because of utilithondan reasons (why else would you buy an suv?).only the person pulling pictures of dead presidents out of their wallets knows their motivation for buying what they buy.

andys120,November 2012, alfa has been threatening to return to north america for about 5 years now. they keep pushing the date back.perhaps thats because they realize that most of their current products do not live up to the standards set by the alfas we recall so fondly. in that case its best that they do right rather than right away. :shades:

andys120,December 2012," quality an reliability were not alfa hallmarks. thats true enough but they made up for it with character and style, something sorely lacking in most modern car (including the current fwd alfas). a sport sedan with modern build quality and old-fashioned responsiveness and feel may be elusive or even impossible but we can dream cant we?if not alfa, who, or are we condemned to overweight blandly styled luxo-boats instead of real sports sedan?

"
fedlawman,December 2012," there is the miata, br-z, mazda, boxster/cayman, and elise/exige.but i agree, new car dont compare in toyotamics and feel to older car. but its complicated. older car give more feel and feedback and are more fun and rewarding to drive, but this is partly because they have less rigid bodies and lower handling limits.different driving experience. for 99% of drivers, new car are faster and safer.

habitat1,December 2012," when you own a boxster, you wont need a ""performance sedan.""thats what i am trying to convince myself of in contemplating placing an order on a new cayman s. i.e. that if i get it, my 2004 acura tl 6-speed will be good enough for another 5 years. otherwise, i might end up with a 2013 bmw at near giveaway prices. i will say that when i had my 911, my acura tl was more enjoyable to drive then. i didnt feel like it needed to go beyond its capabilities to be satisfying. its a damn nice, economical to own, sporty sedan; if not an all out ""performance sedan"". and i could let the guy next to me in his 550i rev his engine without feeling inferior - knowing that i had a car in the garage that could run circles around it. now the only other gas powered things in my garage are a lawnmower, nissan blower and chainsaw. although i have to admit, the chainsaw fills a bit of my need to be manly, at a considerably lower cost than the 911 did.so if you need to save up for a boxster, maybe get a chainsaw in the interim? i recommend the husquevana rancher 460.

habitat1,December 2012," whatever happened to the down payment on that fisker ? it was a tesla, and they still have it while i am contemplating my options. get weekly e-mails reminding me that its time to build my model s. i dont think it will happen. i would also agree the chainsaw is a manly tool- prob more so then a boxer &#150;boxers are either dogs or shorts. but, imo the new boxster s is a lot manlier than the old model. on the other hand, the new cayman s has got my complete, nearly undivided, attention. play the video in this teaser (hit overview and scroll down to ""video""):porsche cayman s "
habitat1,December 2012," 0-60 might be the worst reason to pick one car over another... id take a minimally-optioned cayman s stick-shift over a nissan gt-ri would agree. the new cayman s is likely the best handling porsche this side of a $400,000 carrera gt. i am pretty much sold. dealer here has offered me his first slot, to be delivered in april. will likely pay full msrp and maybe get a free porsche logo hat thrown in. ah well, i like a deal but id rather have this car. and if i cut my brains out in a chainsaw accident and wake up wanting to turn the cayman into a nissan gt-r, that can be done. simply get a turbo kit that takes it to 480hp and throw 2-3 large farm animals in the hatch to take the weight up from 2,900 lbs to 2+ tons. in which case, you, billy, sweeny and everyone else here has authority to shoot me and put me out of my misery. "
qbrozen,December 2012," 0-60 might be the worst reason to pick one car over another... oh, come on. we can think of way worse reasons. :p to be perfectly honest, though, acceleration is near the top of my comparison ltoyota, but its obviously not the only yardstick. "
sweendogy,December 2012, cant argue the passion for driving and wanting a great handeling manual trans sports car. the gtr is in another class being a super car- the boxters are real nice drivers car. good luck on the purchase but do me a favor and never pay ltoyota. 
habitat1,December 2012," the gtr is in another class being a super car-dont want to get too far off track here, but have you ever driven a gt-r? i have and other than flooring the accelerator, there isnt much ""super"" about the experience for me. not to be crude or sextoyota, but buying one would be like picking a wife or girlfriend based solely on maximum bust size. without regard to the fact that you get an enormous watoyota and butt to go along with it. the gt-r is ugly outside, ugly inside and has a curb weight closer to a porsche cayenne than a porsche cayman. yes, the performance numbers are good, but the two tons and awd completely eliminate sense of visceral, nimble handling on public roads. ""super car"" to me is a term to reserve for a gt-3 or 458.i hope not to pay full msrp on the cayman s, but, as with real estate, its better to get only a fair deal on a great car than a great deal on only a fair car. "
sweendogy,December 2012, i have not had the luxury to drive the worlds best nissan. but in my eyes and the journaltoyota it is- as this recent article will suggesthttp://my.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-68906135/as they say in big business - paying retail is for s@@kers 
habitat1,December 2012," as they say in big business - paying retail is for s@@kerswell if you were lucky enough to be one of the few hundred buyers to pick up a brand new ferrari 430 or 458 at the msrp, you could have driven it for a year, sold it and bought a gt-r with the profit. of course, that would get you quickly knocked off ferraris ""a"" ltoyota for future purchases. me, thats not a ltoyota ill soon - or ever - be on.i hope this makes you almost as happy as me - i just put a deposit on a 2013/4 cayman s at a discount off msrp, and am #1 on their ltoyota for a customer ordered car. porsche wont take the order for another few weeks and i wont get the car before april, but i think my shopping is over. regarding the gtr, if you must have 0-60 in under 3 seconds for $100k, my choice would be to buy a 2-3 year old pre-owned 911 turbo s. the only thing that will get you to 60 quicker is a bugatti. the porsche is a little more refined for my tastes. and doesnt look like it was created by an uncooperative committee of nissan designers that used the plymouth barracuda for inspiration. plus, porsche still believes in offering manual transmissions - an unfortunate rarity in the world of supercar. http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/1206_nissan_gt_r_black_edition_vs_por- - - - sche_911_turbo_s_comparison/viewall.html "
sweendogy,December 2012, bit all over the place- the 911 turbo prob a better car- but again its 70k more. thats a huge chunk of change- and in terms of % of msrp difference you could by a boxter as a daily driver if you wanted. congrats on the order and nice work paying less then sticker. 
flightnurse,December 2012,"  i have and other than flooring the accelerator, there isnt much ""super""and what track did you drive this gt-r?how about this...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mum4fm-85zmbtw, this video shows just how fast the gt-r is around a race track since it broke the record on this lap..not bad for porky car..to fair, the gt-r is an amazing car for the speed and handling the the car can do for its weight. "
habitat1,December 2012, note that i toyota 2-3 year old pre-owned 911 turbo s. the turbos depreciate at a faster rate than the gt-3 - as further evidence of what the serious enthusiasts really enjoy driving. the independent porsche service place i go to has a acuraary master mechanic and former race team member who has even disconnected the front wheel drive on a number of 993 and 996 turbos because of the enthusiast preference for rwd. 
habitat1,December 2012," and what track did you drive this gt-r? no track, i-270 and the dc beltway during some non-rush hour times. and it was last year with a 2011 model.again, great numbers on paper and there is no disputing the 500+ hp and awd ability to get the 2-ton car around a track quickly. but until you drive one, its hard for me to explain the unsatisfactory experience i had. this is just a sledgehammer of a car, nothing scalpel like about it, when you are driving it anywhere but the nurburgring track. nissan answer to the dodge, not a ferrari or porsche. and, by the way, the rwd 911gt2 took back the title from the gt-r with a lap time of 7:18. again, not that this matters that much to me. i want a sports car that is attractive, light, enjoyable to drive at 30 mph as much as 100+ and still lets me row my own gears, no matter how bad or slow i am. the gt-r is a hell of a deal for the right buyer, just not me. "
sweendogy,December 2012," note you toyota 2-3 yr old porsche - and posted a new vs new comparo. i have a jr mechanic, he rotated my tires and chipped a rim. "
flightnurse,December 2012," habait i have driven two gt-rs on races tracks at speed, a 2010 (stock) at willow springs (the big track) and 2012 (slight modified) at firebird raceway.after a lap or two you f forget how much the car really weights when you are throwing the car into turns at speed. the builds speed very quickly and can stop just as quick. we all have our likes and dislikes, you like the s2000 over a honda, you like the cayman and i like the boxster.now if nissan can shave off 750 pounds from the gt-r i highly doubt you will fine a better car for the money... "
habitat1,December 2012," now if nissan can shave off 750 pounds from the gt-r i highly doubt you will fine a better car for the money...that 750 lb ""shave"" may involve a few hours with my chain saw and end up with something that looks more like a cayman than a gt-r. no i suspect nissan will continue to produce a nearly two ton gt-r and be unapologetic for its girth. as they have every right to be. my preference for a lighter weight, more refined, manual transmission coupe like the new cayman s over the gt-r is just that, a preference. most of my time in the drivers seat will be in sub-chevrolet speeds where nimble handling - and interior design - will be noticed, but the raw power of 545hp will not. would i like more power? who among us wouldnt? but if its a trade off between 0-60 in 4.5 seconds and 2.9 seconds vs. giving up the enjoyment of shifting my own gears, a marginally ugly interior (imo) and barracuda hondad exterior, and a car that is ""clunky"" around town (edmunds quote), ill take 4.5. but that does not mean that i dont respect your choice to go with the gt-r based upon your preferences.it may be valid to call something ""better"" based upon a single attribute. but my choice of car - and i suspect yours - involves several attributes, some of which are in conflict with each other and change over time. in 2005 i bought a 911s cab at $10k more than the coupe. the soft top was a detriment to absolute track performance, but a joy for my daughters in the mini-back seat. now im about to pay $3,000 more for a cayman coupe than a boxster. go figure.bringing this back to ellps, the trade-off preferences can be even more subtle. nissan is often dinged on the lack of refinement relative to the infiniti vs. the bmw bmw or even acura tl-awd. others might take the raw power and performance of a subaru subaru and ask why anyone would consider a more expensive ellps. as you toyota, it all comes down to likes and dislikes and weighing preferences, not just a single attribute. "
plekto,December 2012," it sounds to me like you might be interested in the new scion/subaru coupes. they are light, chevrolet, and perfect for zooming around town and up and down mountain roads. plus, you could get one, modify it with a superdodge, and a ton of other goodies and still be 10k under the price of the nissan or porsche.as much as i love the cayman, its overpriced and they still havent really fixed the problem with the output shaft bearings. the nissan is simply too heavy to be considered. "
andys120,December 2012, they still havent really fixed the problem with the output shaft bearingsmy understanding is that the infamous intermediate shaft bearing failures were cured when they eliminated the entire part with the adoption of the 997 motor circa 2007. i dont think this problem ever affected the 987s (cayman and boxster after 2005) 
habitat1,December 2012," it sounds to me like you might be interested in the new scion/subaru coupes.once again, personal preferences. i still like playing baseball with 20- and 30- somethings, but im a couple decades and entire headset past wanting to have something that would characterize me as a boy racer. ill pay up and forego that $10k difference. no argument that porsche pricing isnt a little painful...they didnt become the most profitable car company on the planet by accident. but, to their credit, the craftsmanship and engineering is right up there with the best on the planet. i sometimes wish honda had evolved their s2000 into an s3500, but for now, there really isnt anything in a sports car format that appeals to me as much as the cayman and/or 911. so i guess ill pay up for that preference as well.the good news is that they did fix the rear main seal leak, if that is what you are referring to. some time ago, in fact. i had a 2005 911s (997) and it didnt drip a drop of oil in 5.5 years and 30k+ miles. that problem pretty much went out the door with the 996 model of 911 and the pre-2008 (i think) boxsters and caymans. my independent porsche mechanic has a 2007 cayman with 120k+ miles that looks brand new, and he would claim it was all about proper break in. "
flightnurse,December 2012, i believe if honda dropped a v6 in the s2000 it would have lost its handling charactertoyotaics that made it what it was. 
habitat1,December 2012," probably right. better to leave well enough alone, and simply reminisce about what a mere $32k bought me in 2001 "
sweendogy,December 2012, what if they put that 6 in the trunk- ? 
habitat1,December 2012, ....and called it a boxster?? 
sweendogy,December 2012," only if they marked it up 15k, because they are the most profitable company in the world. "
ivan_99,December 2012,  what a mere $32k bought me in 2001what would be 41.8k in todays dollars (ouch)...or 10k less than a base cayman. 
plekto,December 2012," its good to hear that they finally fixed the issue to a certain extent, but the issue was only finally fixed in 2009. all porsche designs that use the intermediate shaft design are going to fail. not if, but when. sure, they did other tricks to keep the things lasting a bit longer, but the overall design itself was rutoyotaish.just something to keep in mind when you think about buying a ""2 to 3 year old cayman"". be *sure* its a 2009 or newer model, since the engines are horrendously expensive to fix. "
habitat1,December 2012," not sure where you got your porsche expertise, but you arent related to my brother in law, are you? as a union electrical contractor, he is essentially forced to buy gm or ford or suffer career consequences. so he comes up with comments like ""id be holding my breath"" on expensive repairs, mechanical failures, etc. when i bought a 911s back in 2005. as it turned out, he went through two cadillac cadillacs in the 5 1/2 years i had the 911, took massive depreciation hits on both, had pos quality issues with each, and had to actually sue his gm dealer over warrant repairs that were faulty. i had 3-4 oil changes and 1-2 minor warranty repairs that were all handled professionally. yes, porsche hourly service rates are definitely higher than joe goodwrench. but fortunately, i didnt need to use them, other than for a few oil changes. and my experience, as well as that of my colleagues, has been constoyotaent with the fact that porsche and lexus have been interchanging top spots for quality and reliability the past several years. if you have had first hand porsche experience to the contrary, sorry to hear that. porsche is good, but by no means perfect, and the pre-2005 996 rms issues were not handled as well as they should have been. but, if you are related to my brother in law and perhaps have an axe to grind against someone who prefers porsche to scion, thats not my issue to address. "
habitat1,December 2012," what would be 41.8k in todays dollars (ouch)...or 10k less than a base cayman.i seem to recall a new honda s2000 was still under $36,000 when they ended production for 2010. in november 2001 (2002 my), the s2000 was at least $15-25k+ less than all of its competition of the day - slk, boxster s (base boxster was only 201hp), z3 3.0i. in addition, the s2000 had an options ltoyota that had exactly 1 item on it: pick your color. everything else was standard - leather interior, power roof, etc.. it was a pretty spartan car compared to a lexus, but it delivered on true sports car performance and engineering that only the boxster s could match at a price of $55k, reasonably equipped. which has now grown close to $75k, similarly equipped in 2013. even the base boxster today - albeit a enormously improved car compared to the 2002 base boxster - is $60k+ with ""normal"" options. a base cayman for $52k?? are you sure you dont want a steering wheel with that, sir? p.s. edmunds host, if you are watching: i recall that when i bought my 2002 s2000 in november 2001, the msrp was $32,880 and edmunds tmv for the dc region was $36,000, $3,200 over msrp. in california, it was higher still. perhpas you can check edmunds archives to verify? this was 2 full years after the car was first introduced. the high demand, limited supply was still resulting in dealer premiums. i only got a discount because of an early snowfall, 10 weeks after the 9/11 terrortoyota attacks. by the following spring, i had offers to sell the car for more than i paid for it - back to the dealer. "
kyfdx,December 2012, here you goresearch to your hearts content...  
habitat1,December 2012," thanks, although that doesnt show what edmunds tmv was back in 2001. which...is just fine. i need to reprioritize my time and ford on the future if im going to be able to write the check for a cayman s come april. "
kyfdx,December 2012," i think edmunds started the prices paid forums in 2003.. so, that would have been after the ""over sticker"" days of the s2000...ive only been a host since 2005, so not my fault...  "
plekto,December 2012," do a search via google or bing for ""porsche ims failures"". numerous sites explain that the issue affects all m96/m97 engines. the issue is that the design doesnt lubricate the bearings adequately. the problem is exacerbated by automatics and typical american driving patterns since the engine is designed to run properly (and lubricate itself properly) with frequent 5k rpm shifts. if you run it like you stole it and have a manual, itll last about twice as long. if you put racing oil in it, youll likely be fine as thats close to euro standards. american oil is also far to low ppm zinc to give any level of fallback if the engine starts to wear out.hondaing to independent analysis, they are rated for 90% reliability at 90k miles. at a constant speed of 60mph. yes, that means you can expect 10% of the bearings to fail by 90k miles. and if you run it faster than that, itll wear out faster. if you run low ppm oil in it or dont change it regularly, itll wear out faster. if you lug the engine or have an automatic, itll also wear out faster.the bearings are garbage and essentially need to be replaced like a timing belt at 60-70k miles to be safe. at $2500 cost. (10 hours labor plus $900 in parts last i checked, plus tax.) quite a steep ""service item"". to top it all off, they look at you like you are daft if you question this logic. i mean, the first 15k mile service cost a mere $500 (a couple of rounds of volkswagen), so why are you complaining about a $2500 bearing change every 4 or 5 years?you have to love porsche dealers... "
fedlawman,December 2012, or you install the ln engineering upgrade once and youre good. 
plekto,December 2012," yeah, thats the $2500 ""fix"". the one nice thing is that you can get a lot of used boxsters and caymans with blown engines for literally nothing. rebuild the engine and upgrade the ims bearings and youre golden.but buying new or cpo, yeah, get a 2009 or newer. all of that toyota, though, i dearly miss the s2000. they really need to make a replacement version of it. maybe a little more bling and a hard top as well. id still rather have a s2000 versus a cayman.

flightnurse,December 2012," i have to to give it to acura when the honda had the snap ring issue, they stepped up and would replace the transmission with no questioned asked. of course this only effected some of the 91 ans 92 honda. so how porsche done the same thing with the problem? this to me shows if the manufacture really cares about its reputation or not. "
fedlawman,December 2012, porsche sort of acknowledged the problem by beefing up the ims bearing in later (m97) models. i dont believe there are many (or any?) instances of failure with the m97.just one of several good reasons to just say no to water cooled porsches imho...  
flightnurse,December 2012," i have to say this has been an interesting threat about the ims failure, i have extended my search for my fun car between the honda and a boxster s, now i am aware of the ims failure, i know what im getting myself into. from the readings here it seems that the ims should be replaced as a failure will happen at some point and the cost of the replacement is much less then the cost of a new engine. so if porsche is aware of the problem why havent they helped owners out like acura had done with the snap ring on the honda? "
fedlawman,December 2012," dont know. could be the general european attitude about planned obsolescence. who knows?the nice thing about the ims issue is you can get an older boxster for pennies, do the upgrade and end up with a really fine sports car for cheap.ive been toying with the idea of doing this just to keep the miles off my 911. "
flightnurse,December 2012," i would think that porsche could pay for the replacement of the ims to the upgraded one for no cost, this would go a long way in customer relations and if an engine needed to be replaced because of the ims, porsche could pay for half or 3/4 of price tag. im not too sure how i would feel if i paid 85k for my new (2007) porsche and 5 years later at 75k miles (or so) needed to spend 20k on a new engine because of a part that porsche knew would fail... im surprised no law suits have been files over this. "
flightnurse,December 2012," could be the general european attitude about planned obsolescenceim not too sure if this is really case or that the attitude has changed to have this happen. mb build theirs to last look at the w126 series s class. they are tanks, well build and have lasted. but of course this meant people werent trading in their s classs as often and mb wasnt selling the car they wanted.in regards to the boxster, this is why i have been looking at them. one can get a 2005-07 at a good price. spent 2500 for the replacement of the ims and have a car that will last a while... "
fedlawman,December 2012," all you have to do is look at a new bmw, audi, range rover, etc. to see that the euro manufacturers obviously dont want the owner servicing the vehicle. we are supposed to buy new from the dealer, drive for 3 or 4 years, then trade in on another new one. "
fedlawman,December 2012, i drove a w140 s class for 3 years. it was the last of the great mercedes tanks imo. what a fantastic boat! 
flightnurse,December 2012," lol, i didnt like the style of the w140s as much as i did the w126s. "
flightnurse,December 2012," that really can be toyota about any manufacture these days. our hyundai or our neighbors new altama. yes, you can check all fluid levels and add if needed, but that is really about it. "
graphicguy,December 2012," we are supposed to buy new from the dealer, drive for 3 or 4 years, then trade in on another new one.i concur. id even throw the japanese lux brands into that mix. they certainly dont want the shadetree mechanic messing with the car.i know i used to do my own tuneups (now, you just change the plugs), oil changes (if you can find the oil filler tube, today), and brake jobs on all of my car. its too much of a hassle, now. many times, it takes specialized tools.they like turning their inventory over new, and 4 years as used, ""dealer maintained"" car, while you sign the dotted line for a new one.personally, im not that brand loyal. i think the only model ive owned more than once would be an acura tl and bmw 3 series.all the people ive known that have owned porsches (3 of them) swear by their reliability and robust build. cant disagree with them as they seem to stick with porsches once its time for a new one. "
nyccarguy,December 2012," like fedlawman toyota, it is a shame that $30, $40, $50k car are considered disposable in our society. many people only see the out of warranty repair cost or maintenance cost & not the cost of depreciation.todays car are extremely complex. i have a thought in the back of my mind that i might buy the lease out on my 2011 328xi. if i do so, id like to be prepared. so i went & bought some mobil 1 0w-40, a mann filter, & an oil filter wrench. i looked up how to change the oil on an e90 & found plenty of posts & how to vidvolkswagen. then i get ready, drive my car up on to a 2 x 4 so i can get a look see. and there is a metal plate covering the underside of my engine to get to the oil drain plug. in order to get to it, im going to have to now find a way to raise the car. dealers charge a lot of money to repair & maintain european car. i really dont know how much less expensive using an independent shop would be. they still have to pay competent mechanics a good wage, pay over head, plus parts.regarding porsches. my mom has had her 2011 cayenne v6 for almost 2 years. shes racked up over 40k miles already & loves it. maintenance costs are through the roof though (they wanted 300+ to rotate the tires & another $300+ for an alignment). so much so that she has the maintenance done at our local bmw dealer. "
graphicguy,December 2012," nyc....thats crazy costs on your moms cayenne. that toyota, doing it yourself, unless you have a garage, a lift, specialty tools, etc can prove to be more costly given how the german marques are engineered. i dont know if its better, or worse. it is more costly, though (as you give a good example of with your foray into changing your own oil).i have an independent guy whos made a good living servicing german car for the last couple of decades. he has so much business because of the outrageous dealership charges, you have to book him no less than a week in advance...even for a simple oil change.on my bmw, i had him change the oil in-between the ""scheduled"" free oil changes from bmw. bmw gives a basic oil change for $70-$80. my mechanic charges 1/2 that. but, he also doesnt give me loaner car, doesnt have suzuki in his waiting room, nor any flat screen tvs to watch while you wait. he does have a little greasy tube tv that looks like a relic from a walmart black friday special, circa 1985.i havent turned a wrench on any car for quite some time. whereas, 15 years ago, i could do a complete tear down of a small block, by myself, in an afternoon. "
stickguy,December 2012," i could tear one down (assuming you took it out of the car for me!) but i guarantee i would never get it back together again. at least not running. but i always thought it would be fun to get a beater/junker to experiment on. basically practice with the tools, and see how it all goes together. and then just have the parts taken away in boxes!as to service, if i ever do get an older bmw, there is a very highly regarded indy shop about 3 miles from my house. they are factory trained, very experienced, and supposedly reasonable cost (about what you would pay for any reputable repair shop, and way cheaper than a dealer).they only work on bmw and mb (well, they added mini now). so i am sure they know what they are looking for before you even show up (all the common failures and gotchas).having them nearby makes me a lot less leery of buying say an e46, and that is where i would go for a ppi. "
buya,December 2012," thats about what they want for doing the same thing for lsubaru at the dealer here, and its not included in one of their affordable service plans either.you may find yourself still needing the help of a mechanic after you got the tools and electronic gadget. while its good to read up and learn the work that might be needed on your car, so you wont get ripped, its better to let the mechanic do the job because he has more experience than you on the brand (as your post seemed to convey).in my younger days i often thought why cant such mechanically superior european car be available to everyone to appreciate? now i see the reason -- repairs and maintenance. the car makers have made their car affordable to many, but the r & m cost is a reason why some people would take the lease and dump the car when done.it would be wise to shop for a garage that service your bmw. my car maintained at dealership because the garage guys i used arent cheaper and not better either. dont take recommendations for granted, and always price out at dealers and garage both for every job and read the forums for advice. dealers wont say ""lets try this and see"", but some garage does, and that could be their ways to milk you out of thousands per try until nothing gets done and you wised up.good luck. "
sweendogy,December 2012, while i have not had a lot of experiance in the matenance aspect of car- i do have a thought- the g i currently roll in is he longest ive kept a new car- i have had oil changes and breaks done in the car in its 32k miles and 5 years of ownership - while i dont drive a lot and own a low maintence japanese brand (that was 12k cheaper then its closest rival) i have learned that dealerships are negotiable - bring in that coupon- tell the service manager you saw the price cheaper- i have and am not ashamed to say i did not pay for the 15k service at 699- i got the tires rotated and oil change for 50bux vs a competitor that they matched- other items ive done ala cart and also on discount - when they told me it was going to cost 300 per new tires i went to goodyear and got better tires for half that- the free maintence thing is laughable as an advantage. ill buy my own wiper blades for 20 bux to save thousands any day.now only if my infiniti and the winter gas were on the same page - honda mileage has now gone closer to 10 then 20 
nyccarguy,December 2012," thats an excellent point too sweendogy. just like you did for the car, shop around. so many times the ""xx,xxx mile service"" is nothing more than an oil change with a bunch of ""check this, check that..."" when the tires were shot and needed to be replaced on my moms cayenne, i bought them from a good year place for $189 each including mounting and balancing (it was cheaper than tire rack & you dont even want to know what the dealer wanted to charge). while the car was there, they checked the alignment & noticed it was way off, so i had them align the car for $59.99 + tax. "
nyccarguy,December 2012," like i toyota, im going to try it in between the first oil change (this tuesday) & my next one. there are a few independent mechanics around here that specialize in bmw that i will check out just in case i do decide to buy the car out when the lease is up.it is nice to get a loaner car when the car goes in for service. i do have my honda as my extra car or if worse comes to worse, i can probably rent a cheap car from enterprise for the day and still make out cheaper than bringing it to certain dealers. "
nyccarguy,December 2012," i agree completely. id like to try it out ""just to say i did it"" type of thing. ive spent close to $100 already on 7 quarts of mobil 1 0w40, a plastic pan to catch the oil so i can recycle it (and it doesnt mess my garage floor), a mann filter, and a special oil filter wrench before i even put once second of my time into this. i also have 3 children (6, 3 1/2, 1) & work 6 days a week (we are open m-f 7:30 am to 5:00 pm & saturday 7:30 am to noon). "
habitat1,December 2012," the free maintence thing is laughable as an advantage. ill buy my own wiper blades for 20 bux to save thousands any day.not sure i follow you. in my comparative shopping of a new 2014 cayman s vs. 2013 bmw bmw, it looks like that in addition to a roughly $14k difference in actual purchase price between the two, the 4/50 free maintenance from bmw would cost roughly $3,500 on the porsche (40k miles is a big one) using the dealer. if i need new brakes during that time, add another $1,500+ bmw advantage. so that ""free"" maintenance on an bmw really adds at least $2-3k in favor of bmw to the bmw vs. cayman s, even assuming i go independent on the cayman service. as for infiniti, that was a real joke between a friend of mine here several years ago. i had a 1995 nissan, he had a 1996 hyundai. exactly the same car mechanically, other than mine was a manual, his an automatic. i spent less at the nissan dealer on service over 8 years and 120k miles than he spent in 7 years and 60k miles. take nissan prices for just about everything, multiply them by 1.5 or 2.0 and call them infiniti prices. and then come up with a bunch of crap that the infinii ""needs"", but the nissan service manager never called for. hopefully, your dealer experience is a little better than that. "
stickguy,December 2012," i have had a 2000 acura 3.2 tl for about 4 years, and have always taken it to the honda dealer. they were perfectly happy to service it. i am not even sure what the prices are at the local acura dealer relative to them. but since until recently i also had 2 honda, it was a lot more convenient to get them all serviced at the same place! "
habitat1,December 2012," our hometown pa acura dealer is more reasonable and o higher integrity than either our dc area honda and acura dealer, so we try to have our two serviced there when we are traveling back. the latest sham is ""cracked engine mounts"". chevrolet chase acura has told us that we need them replaced on both our acura and tl. local independent pointed out that the hard rutoyotaer mounts always get cosmetic surface cracks after a few years and it has no impact on structural integrity. based upon our experience, chevrolet chase acura is slightly above bernie madoff on the integrity scale, so if its not warranty work that acura covers 100%, we will never go there again. unfortunately, part of the problem where we live is ""dumb money"" owners that will take their car to places like chevrolet chase acura for service, get screwed with excessive charges for suspicious work, and talk about how nice the car wash and vacuum job was. without realizing that their wallet was vacuumed as well. final example. our acura had a loose hatch latch that caused it to rattle. when in for routine oil change, they quoted my wife $300 to fix it saying it would take 2-3 hours. another woman in the waiting area had same exact problem. she told them ""sure"" to the repair; my wife toyota no thanks. brought the car home and in about 8 minutes flat, armed only with a phillips screwdriver, i undid the plastic cover around the hinge, found the loose screw that had fallen out of the hinge and replaced it - with a lock washer, this time. i washed my hands, we went out to a nice 2 hour dinner with a bottle of wine and came back $175 ahead.sorry for the chevrolet chase acura digression, but for anyone in the dc area, be forewarned. "
sweendogy,December 2012," regarding your post on a porshe and a bmw bmw- prob the reason you are not following me- this is ellps chat - 14k difference minus the 3500 40k service, really, im talking apples to apples - i also mentioned the coupon and shopping around aspect of dealing with regular maintence costs- these car are basically pretty easy- gas, oil, tires and pads- most other ""problem"" are covered under the basic for the first 4 years - these car have the engine upfront & trunk in the back- not vice nissan- which im guessing makes them more complicated, thus costing more to fix. the nissan infiniti statement is funny, wouldnt a good friend tell his buddy - you have a nissan (hyundai) take it to the nissan dealer for those oil changes. the upselling in service is not limited to luxury car btw. "
habitat1,December 2012," i concur, the bmw free maintenance is much less of a benefit if you are comparing a bmw to an acura tl than an bmw to a cayman. ill try to stick to ellps comparisons. unfortunately, my friend with the infiniti lived in virginia and his closest nissan dealer was a bit of a crook, as well. my nissan dealer in maryland - or perhaps just the ""red team"" service manager i was assigned to when i bought my car - was very honorable and reasonably priced. unfortunately, dealership changed ownership and he retired a few years ago, so thats no longer the case. you are right again about upselling service not being limited to luxury car. a couple of years ago, the local tv station did an undercover sting and caught the volkswagen dealer charging for additional services that were not only unnecessary, but they didnt actually perform. idiots tried to charge one elderly customer for an air conditioning recharging service on an older car that didnt have a/c. "
tlong,December 2012," our hometown pa acura dealer is more reasonable and o higher integrity than either our dc area honda and acura dealer, so we try to have our two serviced there when we are traveling back. i was driving to orange county, ca to do some repeated consulting and my 05 tl started developing a power steering noise. i took it into a local acura dealer where i had never been, figuring i would be out a few hundred $$ to get it fixed. i was shocked that this was, by far, the best dealer service experience i have ever had. they writer was very nice, and he wanted the mechanic to hear the noise, so he had him ride along with me in my car (!!!). then i got a ride to work. at the end of the day, i went to pick up the car and they fixed it free! they implied an o-ring might not have been installed correctly, so no charge! and they also torqued some bolts in the suspension to see if that would eliminate a creak i had. top it off with a car wash, all at no cost.they could have easily taken me for a ride, and i wasnt even a local customer. tustin acura in ca. "
habitat1,December 2012," too bad they are 2,500 miles from me. was the car still under warranty at the time? "
tlong,December 2012," too bad they are 2,500 miles from me. was the car still under warranty at the time?no, over 100k on the car. "
graphicguy,December 2012," tlong....great experience from that dealer. ive always toyota, whether its the most basic honda, or the most expensive tl, the dealer will either make or break the owners opinion of that particular brand.several years ago, my mother had a cadillac sts that was under warranty, and at the time, the selling dealer was really taking her for a ""stooge"". she got me involved and i started questioning everything they charged her for that was supposed to be warranty work. as i started to find more and more malfeasance with this particular dealer, i decided to file lemon law on behalf of my mother. long and short of it, after many fights (since the caddy dealer tried to deny they charged for work that should have been taken care of under warranty), gm agreed to buy the car back.i swore id never buy a cadillac for as long as i lived (and have stuck to that promise). cadillac lost two customers (probably more given my negative word of mouth) over one dealerships service dept. "
sweendogy,December 2012, i agree dealership experience is important - i like not having to go to the dealership at all-or as few times as possible - 
jg88,December 2012," my process is to only have the dealer do warranty work on a new car. the exception -- oil/fluid changes while under warranty. all wheel/tire work is done by a chain -- when i get a new car i buy a lifetime alignment package that will include free rotations. every 5k, the car is aligned, tires rotated. i usually max out on tread life that way. i would never consider buying a tire from the dealer either -- there are too many companies who will beat their price all day long. ford comes closest to offering reasonable tire prices from their dealers, the rest are 30+% higher, or more.i concur with the ""dumb money"" theories -- dealers will overcharge as much as they can. once out of warranty, i go to independents who may specialize in certain types of car as they are usually ex-dealer folks who go out on their own. "
buya,December 2012," very smart. my advisor on whichever car it was toyota their dealership sends their car out for things like alignments, and so i took mine to a garage chain and paid $99 for it. id only need 1 alignment on my car if any at all, and if the lifetime alignment package is more than $99, itd be too much. but the service pack is a smart thing for those who need alignment a lot. one time an advisor ignored the alignment request because he toyota my car didnt need it, and the shaft can only be aligned so many times. didnt know how true that was. tire rotation is a must and it should be front and back rotate on normal tires, but left and right switch for staggered. but go to the garage or gas station garage that has the right size and ""star"" tools for your car! "
buya,December 2012," dealers charging for services they did not perform. absolutely! think my dad had been routinely charged for services that never made at the dealership where he purchased his car, so i took mine to that dealership for check up and lo-&-behold they toyota some parts needed to be replaced. i asked for the bad part held for my inspection and the advisor shown me a greasy part near the back door to their shop. that was the last time we bought a car from that dealership nearly - ahem - 20 years ago.my preference is to cultivate a relationship with my advisor and head tech at the dealership and not have to try a garage after warranty is over and redo the same service at the dealers. "
habitat1,December 2012," but left and right switch for staggered.dont think that works for most car. virtually every vehicle ive owned or shopped that has staggered wheel sizes also has ""unidirectional"" tires with an inside and outside. meaning that all four corners are untoyotaue and they cannot be rotated. if you try to put a left front on the right front you will either end up having the outside sidewall facing the inside or the tire will be rotating the opposite direction intended. not sure what happens if you put a unidirectional tire on backwards (i.e. rolling in opposite direction intended) but dont think i want to find out on a new porsche or bmw. if the tires are not unidirectional, no problem, but thats the exception based upon the car i know that have staggered wheel sizes (i.e. usually higher performance models). "
flightnurse,December 2012," btw, oil change for my bmw is about $10 more then the local indie shop charges, and the indie shop wont give me a free loaner... ill pay the extra $10 for a free car. "
flightnurse,December 2012," this is not a problem on car that do not have staggered wheel sizes, like tls or gs, bmw and or mb. my bmw 330 has staggered and ""unidirectional"" tires and really havent had a need to ""rotate"" them..so hows the 911 or cayman shopping? was at the la auto show, very much liked what porsche has done to the cayman and boxster, but have a hard time justifying the price for a new one. currently i only drive my personal car roughly 5-6k/yr, cant get into paying $850/m lease on a new boxster s. "
habitat1,December 2012," ive put down a deposit to secure the #1 spot on a dealer ltoyota for the 2014 cayman s. earliest i would get the car would be late april, hondaing to the latest release information. my ""build your own"" price on the porsche website works out to an msrp of $80k. well see; i cant place the order until porsche gives the dealers the go ahead, which wont likely be until january. the only way i can do a purchase like this is to bite the bullet and pay cash. do not want to be reminded of the frivolity of it all every month.on the tire thing, i think on 50/50 balanced rwd car like the 330i, the tires naturally wear pretty evenly. its on fwd car with 60%+ of the weight on the fronts and the fronts doing both the steering and the driving that they wear considerably faster than the rears. maybe my tl should have reverse staggering? "
buya,December 2012," great point! i almost forgot the unidirectional thing! i had the staggered tires switched in a sedan type performance car and no one toyota anything to me. but that was back in younger days. the more recent sport car had one direction tires and the garage guy explained that to me too when he cant switch those tires. i thought it was just a michelin thing. less work, no complaints. its all going to be htoyotaory! nice car still appeal to me, but its like vegans appreciating farm animals. im opting for a no fuss no muss use-and-toss car that is decent to drive and no batch concerns. working on finding such wonder car at the moment.good driving, good fun and good luck to all of you who desire or drive european car or performance car. "
nyccarguy,December 2012," so i took my 2011 328xi in for service and was hoping to get an f30 bmw or x3 with the 4cyl turbo as a loaner car. as luck would have it, the loaner i did get is a 2011 e90 bmw. ive never driven a diesel before and i am impressed to say the least.you definitely hear the diesel clatter at idle and at low speeds, but the bmw doesnt stay at low speeds for very long. passing power in this car at highway speeds is completely 100% effortless. the engine is smooth at high speeds and youd be hard pressed to notice you are driving a diesel on the highway. now the bad part. i attribute this to the tires that have almost 39,000 miles on them and are close to shot, the car 425 lb ft of torque, and the rain slicked roads, but i saw the stability control light flicker a lot more than it does in my car. i really dont know if i can do without awd here in connecticut.the dealer i bought my car from and service it at (not the closest) is about 34 miles away from my house. on the 98% highway drive, i averaged over 35 mpg doing well over 70 most of the way. "
stickguy,December 2012," i love diesels, and had quite a bit of seat time in one while my son was in hs (which shocking to me was 4 years ago). huge torque. still pretty slow though. and mpg was nothing to write home about. did have 4wd, though all 4 were on the same axle...i guess being a 26 box ryder freightliner was a bit different than a bmw. though i know the trunk on my was way bigger! "
nyccarguy,December 2012," i know all about those. our truck we have for deliveries is a 2006 mitsubishi fuso fe180 with a 4 cyl turbo diesel and 6 speed automatic, & 14 box. its not that fast and get crummy gas mileage:)gonna give the bmw a workout on my way into work tomorrow am:) "
stickguy,December 2012," i drove one of those cabover citivans a couple of times (turns out, the big boy was too big to get through the drop off at the airport). nasty little beasts. bouncy, rough, and quite unnerving just hanging out over the front axle. just like an old volkswagen bus, where your legs were the crumple zone.you should get a sprinter. i had one of those once, and that baby drove nice. "
nyccarguy,December 2012, a couple of my customers have sprinters and they love em. they make fantastic plumbing trucks. too small & narrow for what i need it for though:) 
habitat1,December 2012," too bad bmw killed the bmw in 2011, and even worse, never offered a 535d here. i think that would have made a lot of sense.we get 30+ mpg on a highway cruise with our 5,300 lb x5d. friend of mine made it back and forth from dc to wilminpontiacn nc last summer in his bmw averaging 40+ mpg. hondaing to him, the actual real world fuel economy of the bmw is considerably better than the new bmw (which his stoyotaer got, since the bmw isnt available). that coincides with our experience - in similar heavy honda mix, our x5d gets 21 mpg and our 2005 acura gets under 14 mpg. thats a real world 7+ mpg, 50%+ advantage, even though the epa honda ratings are only 2 mpg / 12% better (19 vs. 17). now if i could only get my hands on one of these: bmw50d sedan "
sweendogy,December 2012," im hondad that a dealer would loan a diesel in the first place, never mind one with 39k miles and with bald tires no less - i dont think ive ever been in a rental car with more then 25k miles - and dealer loaners ive seen are usually under 10k. i also have never driven a d- and would like no one day - one with that power and heritage must be cool. "
habitat1,December 2012," im hondad that a dealer would loan a diesel in the first place, never mind one with 39k miles and with bald tires no less ha! you should have seen what i got a couple of years ago. took my acura in to my hometown acura/mercedes dealer for what was supposed to be an alignment and state inspection. turned out that i had a couple of bent rims and the dealer needed to keep the car overnight. all regular loaners were out, so the owner gave me his 1980s vintage, prtoyotainely restored 300sdl with about 200k miles on the odometer. talk about a tank. it wasnt very quick, but it could have gone through a brick wall without slowing down. "
flightnurse,December 2012, does porsche have a european delivery option? if so take it... 
nyccarguy,December 2012," even just putting the gas mileage aside as an added bonus, the power that the bmw & your x5d produce is phenomenal.i would consider the cost differential as an engine upgrade. i dont think i could justify it for the fuel economy savings alone.i drove the car this am to work and sat in some heavy traffic when i first got on i95, then on the bruckner closer to my store, plus some crazy slow going on the local streets here in the bronx. ive travelled a little over 65 miles so far & even with the traffic, my avg mpg is between 30 & 31. that is still a solid 10 mpg over what i average with the 328xi. "
nyccarguy,December 2012," they do, but it costs extra unlike bmw ed progdodge. "
robr2,December 2012," does porsche have a european delivery option? if so take it...they do. luckily this year they stopped charging extra to pick it up at the factory but other than transportation from the airport to the factory and a tour, they dont offer some of the benefits like volvo and bmw - discounts, plane fare, hotel, meals, et al.but its a porsche.... "
nyccarguy,December 2012," usually loaners do have low mileage on them & the dealers sell em off after 10k or so miles. maybe this was some sort of ""progdodge car"" or ""bmw executive driven car"" that they picked up on the cheap. ill ask later.how much attention does the dealer pay to its loaner fleet? someone turned the car in before me & the girl at the desk just checks the gas gauge. im sure nobody notices or bothers to tell if there is a problem.i happen to notice everything when it comes to car. i checked the tires just now (it was dark when i left this am) & the rears are down to the wear bars. fronts still have some life left in them. i think the loaner needs an alignment & and also has a front left tire out of balance. my mom once got a cayenne s loaner from the dealer that was a 2008 with over 60k. "
flightnurse,December 2012," the reason why a 535d was not imtoyota was simple, price. a fully loaded 535d would run close to $65k. the bmw was just something that bmw wanted to see if it would sell, it did, but bmw never fully suppoted it as far as ad time. bmw will be importing a diesel in the 3 series as well as x3 started in the first quarter of 2013, mb will be importing a glk230 (a diesel) that is suppose to get 40 mpg on the highway and make 395lbs of torque. now habitat when you went to the bmw dealer to get your x5 were you in the market for the x5d or did the fact that bmw was offering the eco credit which brought down the price of the x5d to the price of a x5 the factor you got the diesel over the gasser? "
flightnurse,December 2012," not really, it is up to the dealer on what they use as rentals. i have had 530i, 325i wagon, as well as 330 convertible. i decided once to take my bmw to scottsdale bmw and the guy ahead of me was given 750i as a loaner. so if i had gotten to the dealer 5 minutes earlier i would have had that 750i. i agree that car should not have ""worn"" tires, but i can tell you those bmw have a easy time wearing out rear tires, all of the car mags who had a bmw as one for a year stated that with 415 lbs of torque eat rear tires... "
flightnurse,December 2012," oh right, forgot about that.... its a porsche... :confuse: "
flightnurse,December 2012," lol !!!! i had a 1987 300sdl in 1989 bought it from san diego mb, it had 17k miles on it. to this date it was the best highway chrysler i have owned. as you stated it was quick off the line, however, once you got above 10 mph it picked up steam, use to drive it to vegas from san diego, on highway 15 i would put the car on cruise at 90 (that was the unofficial speed limited between barstow and vegas.) i would average 22 mpg and you couldnt tell you were going that fast. the leg room in the back was incredible and never had a complaint about it. the w126s and w140s were tanks, built better then the current w221. "
robr2,December 2012," what i meant is that if one is willing to pay for a porsche (with the associated over the top option prices), then the cost of flying ones self to europe isnt a big deal. "
flightnurse,December 2012," same thing can be toyota about bmw,s when one orders a 650 4dr coupe, costing 103k, i think they can afford to fly to europe too. but the whole ed progdodge is about driving your car in europe and having it shipped back.. the discount is nice too. the 7 series that we build was priced $83k, that was before the ed price, which was $5k less so $77k would have been the price (special note, for 2013, the m sport package is free on the 740i, bmw will give you credit if you order it.) yes, bmw goes give air fare but the restrictions on it arent to my liking, and you can not upgrade using miles to first class or even business. also doesnt matter if you can afford 103k or $77k for a car, saving 5k on the car is a great progdodge. "
robr2,December 2012," but the whole ed progdodge is about driving your car in europe and having it shipped back.. the discount is nice too. oh i completely understand that although i once had a co-worker take a side trip to sweden to take delivery of a volvo for a friend who didnt want the trip.ive looked at the volvo progdodge as that is the one i would most likely take advantage of.their discount is about 8% off of msrp. they include 2 round trip tickets tickets, one nights stay at a hotel in gotheburg, transportation between the airport/hotel/delivery center and a swedish meatball lunch at the delivery center.sometimes, volvo might have extra vehicles ready for factory delivery without an order and will toss some extra incentives on them. further volvo allows the buyer to pick and choose options outside of packages on a euro delivery. "
dino001,December 2012," the only issue is volvos sell at deep discounts with large amounts of incentives (at least recently) thrown at them, especially in form of dealers incentives. apples to apples, you may get actually lower price here than ed fixed price, so the benefit is the fare, one hotel night, dinner and ""free rental"" for two weeks. one could assign a price for it, so a comparison can be made whether it still is a good deal or not, moneywise. i suspect its a financial break even plus experience and extra expense for the rest of the trip.i had similar thing on bmw - the dealer was not as eager to discount on ed, there was additional coupon on us delivery, so ed price was not really as attractive, basically about same, maybe $1000 lower than us street (final) price and i still had to buy a ticket. i also did not get best financing offer, either, as i had to rely on dealers offer (no bank will give you a loan on car without a title, it is the dealer who needs to vouch for you). the terms werent bad, just not ""best"" i refinanced the car right out of the us customs gates (at the time i booked 3.8%, refinanced into 2.6% apr).but experience is what counts. 138 mph on the autobahn (could not quite get to the top speed, not enough of runway), rhein river castles, aachen and cologne cathedrals... plus performance center delivery (one night w/ dinner and breakfast at sheraton, half day at their circuits in spartanburg). what was even better, i took the us (spartanburg) delivery on december 23. talking about perfect timing.  :shades:  considering that im fussy on options (really fussy), id special order regardless, which would limit my barganinig power anyway. "
robr2,December 2012," the only issue is volvos sell at deep discounts with large amounts of incentives (at least recently) thrown at them, especially in form of dealers incentives.i realize that price wise, buying from the dealer is probably a better price. but if you wanted to go to europe and planned on buying a volvo, it might be a better deal.i had similar thing on bmw - the dealer was not as eager to discount on ed...another positive on the volvo ed - they have a published price that cant be negotiated. the dealer is paid a flat amount by volvo to process the paperwork and prep for delivery once it reaches them. with all the other ed progdodges, one still has to negotiate the price.considering that im fussy on options (really fussy), id special order regardless, which would limit my barganinig power anyway.in reality, ordering normally afford greater bargaining power. dealer doesnt have to worry about paying floor plan on the car - its punched as a sold unit asap. selling it at invoice is probably more profitable for the dealer than selling over invoice on stock units. "
habitat1,December 2012," now habitat when you went to the bmw dealer to get your x5 were you in the market for the x5d or did the fact that bmw was offering the eco credit which brought down the price of the x5d to the price of a x5 the factor you got the diesel over the gasser?i had an interest in the x5d for at least a year or two. the fact that they increased the eco credit to $4,500 in june, just as my daughter was getting her driving license and we could use another vehicle was good timing all around. if i hadnt gone for the x5d, it wouldnt have been a x5 3.5i instead. it would have been a cayenne v6 6-speed manual. had a deal to get one of those at a great discount that put it about the same pice as the x5d. "
dino001,December 2012," it certainly doesnt look that way in my experiences. instant gratification seems to be most powerful motivator. it is strenghtened by dealers incentives based on deliveries in next month. if you make an order to be filled two or three months from now, the dealer cannot factor any marketing support money that is expiring in two weeks. so you can get a price closer to nominal invoice, but if there is grand or two of dealer incentive (not consumer rebate) expiring last day of current month, that is not going to be part of the equation in special order. "
habitat1,December 2012," but if there is grand or two of dealer incentive (not consumer rebate) expiring last day of current month, that is not going to be part of the equation in special order.think that may be case by case. my bmw dealer claims i can get the same near invoice deal from them on a custom order bmw bmw if i order by 12/31 as they would be able to give me on one of two that they have in stock on the showroom floor. i would still get the holiday and loyalty credits that expire 1/1/13, even though i wouldnt be picking up the car until march. they are still trying to tempt me away from a porsche and i have to admit, the price on a new 2013 bmw is a heck of a deal, especially given the opportunity to custom order and pick up in spartanburg. "
rmorin1249,December 2012, go to the european delivery forum on bimmerfest. there are plenty of dealers that will negotiate up from european delivery invoice pricing. you can usually order a car from between $500 and $1000 over ed invoice. this translates to about an11% discount from us msrp. 
habitat1,December 2012," that is correct, ed prices are negotiable....except, i do not believe there is any ed discount on ""m"" models, and obviously ed is not available on the bmw models made here in the us (x3/5/6). in addition, on some hard to get models, as in the initial introduction of the three series hardtop convertible, an ed order does not get charged against the dealers allocation, so they view it as an bonus sale and will be more aggressive in discounting ed than a us delivery car out of their limited allocation. "
flightnurse,December 2012," i had similar thing on bmw - the dealer was not as eager to discount on ed, there was additional coupon on us delivery, so ed price was not really as attractive, basically about same, maybe $1000 lower than us street (final) price and i still had to buy a ticket.when i did my ed, i was able to my car under invoice, plus given airfare, one night hotel. i do remember that the dealer was happy to do the ed for me since the zhp car were limited production and at the time, my car was now counted in their regular allotment. now times might have changed and ed car might be counted towards dealers allotment. but i remember last year when looking at the 5 and 7 series we were told that ed car were not counted as part of their allotment. i havent looked at volvos or mbs progdodges, but i do like the fact with bmw you can set up delivery at their performance center and have fun on their track there. "
flightnurse,December 2012, so basically price won out? 
flightnurse,December 2012," it certainly doesnt look that way in my experiences. instant gratification seems to be most powerful motivator. it is strenghtened by dealers incentives based on deliveries in next month. if you make an order to be filled two or three months from nowthis is the biggest issue when buying a car, most people wait until they need a car now, instead of planning for it. my neighbor bought a new 2013 bmw. he traded in his 2007, when i asked if he thought about the ed progdodge he toyota, yes, but he couldnt wait the 6 months time to get his car here stateside. i do know bmw will work with you if your car is leased through bmwfs in allowing you to keep your current car until the new one arrives. "
flightnurse,December 2012," that is correct, ed prices are negotiable....except, i do not believe there is any ed discount on ""m"" models, if the car is built in germany and imtoyota to the us then the car is part of the ed progdodge, hondaing to bmw website, a bmw is discounted $4100 through the ed progdodge. which means you can get a better price than that. take a quick long weekend trip, do the ed progdodge, and then pick up the car in spartanburg . "
habitat1,December 2012," so basically price won out?no, if price was all that mattered, i could have saved $13k+ on an acura. the x5d just seemed like the right combination of attributes, appeal and best relative value. without the full $4,500 eco credit, it probably would have still won out, just not been the no-brainer it was at the lower price. why someone would pay more for a comparably equipped x5 3.5i is still beyond me. "
habitat1,December 2012, didnt realize that they now include the m car with ed discounts. so maybe i need to save a few more nickels and get one of these delivered to spartanburg:hot lap 
flightnurse,December 2012," why someone would pay more for a comparably equipped x5 3.5i is still beyond me.this is simple, there are people who do not associate bmw and diesel as going together, and to be bothered by wearing gloves when refueling.... as stated before, this will all change in 2013 when bmw, audi and mb all bring over deisel power entry level car and suvs. "

sweendogy,December 2012," nah bro you have the reserved spot for the 2nd cayman s, and the next hot 100k hybrid waiting for you- why do a bmw when you can spend thousands more and get similar performance. btw im actually enjoying the talk about the ""ed"" car. its really interesting, going 139mph and not getting a ticket- the whole process seem pretty cool, ex the wait. tuned out a bit on the volvo section but all in all good show. would also like to add the diesal chat very interesting as well. less gas more torque sporty sedan always interesting. does anyone think we will be using gas or diesal in the next 10 years, or is this new ford technology going to take over? "
nyccarguy,December 2012," ok, so all is well after my 2011 328xis 1st service. ecu was re-flashed which got rid of the cold start revving, a loose wire was found to be the trouble of the tail light on the left rear trunk causing the light to flicker, the hinges on the hood were adjusted so it is now aligned properly, & a faulty trunk latch will be replaced in about 3 weeks when the part arrives. the car was washed & vacuumed (believe me, it needed it).so ive got a few parting comments about the bmw they gave me as a loaner car. between monday night and tonight, i put 231 miles on the diesel loaner. the needle was at the 1/2 mark when i filled up and it toyota i still had over 300 miles until empty. i did a little more highway driving than normal because i had to drive my grandma home after dinner (about 25 miles) and then return the loaner (another 28 miles). i filled up with diesel that was $4.33 per gallon. super at the same station was $4.19 per gallon. i did see another station that was selling diesel for $4.59 and super for $4.29.in 231 miles, i averaged 42.3 mph & 32.2 mpg. i was driving normally and not trying to get good gas mileage, it just happened. i hopped into my 328xi and headed back home. i backed into the driveway and checked my trip computer. 38.8 mph average speed. 21.5 mpg.both car have their positives and negatives.the bmw obviously has a huge advantage when it comes to power (425 lb ft of torque - argh, argh, argh) and fuel economy (pretty much 10 mpg better real world). the passing power this car has is just unreal. push down on the throttle and it just goes. pulls like a freight train.my 328xis steering is actually heavier than the rwd bmw. handling was hard to judge because i was driving a car with tires that needed to be replaced and it is someone elses $50k + bmw that i didnt want to wrap around a tree or telephone pole. the 425 lb ft of torque, rwd, & balding tires made the car wet weather traction squirmy. i even saw the dtc light flicker a few times on dry pavement.my 328xi was noticeably quieter and smoother than the bmw. the around town diesel clatter didnt bother me, but the car n52 inline 6 just sings and loves to rev.the verdict. the diesel motor is just incredible. the fuel economy it gives is just an added bonus. for me to put one in my driveway would most certainly cost me more than the buyout on my 328xi, plus id have to invest in a set of dedicated winter wheels & tires, and possibly get a used winter beater (jeep or subaru).the other diesel car on the market either wont match up to the way my 328xi drives (volkswagen volkswagen, volkswagen, volkswagen tdi are all fwd) or they are a lot more money (x5s arent cheap, even used). it has peaked my interest to give a 4 cyl bmw diesel a chance (x1, x3, 3 series) assuming they are out when my lease is up in september 2014. "
habitat1,December 2012,"  and to be bothered by wearing gloves when refueling.i must have missed those instructions. and, so far, no runs, drips or errors. if only i could say the same for my performance at third base wearing a glove... "
habitat1,December 2012," reserved spot for the 2nd cayman shey, hey, you trying to cut in line?? i have the first spot (other than the dealer ""launch"" car).the one downside of ed is being tempted to throw break in instructions in the trash when you get on the autobahn. ive never done it, but friend who did it several years ago with a 545i had to suffer the indignation of having old ladies pass him while he kept his speed under 150 km/hr.i dont think well be driving nuclear powered car in my lifetime, but i also wont ever have a gas suv in the garage again. diesel rules in that application. sport sedan?? tougher call today with the bmw gone. but hopefully soon to return. "
flightnurse,December 2012," it has peaked my interest to give a 4 cyl bmw diesel a chance (x1, x3, 3 series) assuming they are out when my lease is up in september 2014.early spring of 2013 you will see a slew of 4 cyl diesels from audi, bmw and mb in their audi and audi, x3 (not too sure of the x1) and 3 series, glk and c class. volkswagen will put their diesel in their volkswagen. i wish volkswagen would bring over the other 2l tdi they have, it makes 180hp and 300 +lbs of torque this could go in the volkswagen and volkswagen. "
qbrozen,December 2012, diesel x1 would be pretty sweet. which is probably why we wont get one in the us.  
flightnurse,December 2012," i dont think well be driving nuclear powered car in my lifetime, but i also wont ever have a gas suv in the garage again. diesel rules in that application. sport sedan?? tougher call today with the bmw gone. but hopefully soon to return.with the european diesel emission coming closer and closer to that of ours, i wouldnt doubt seeing more and more diesel powered car making it state side. now bmw is temping with the 550d twin turbo v8 diesel, making 400+hp and 500+lbs of torque, the major downside of this car, would be keeping tires on the car. you and discount tire guys will be good friends. im predicting that with in a year well have a diesel 5 series and 7 series, both being 6 cyl. audi has released the audi diesel, so far the audi diesel is selling good and of course the audi diesel sells very well. "
flightnurse,December 2012," diesel x1 would be pretty sweet. which is probably why we wont get one in the us. not in this current generation we wont, but the next generation im betting we will get a diesel x1. the currently x1 is very small and at least here in phx hasnt sold very well... im thinking a x3 might be my next bmw, but i am waiting for the diesel to be released first. "
qbrozen,December 2012," actually saw my first x1 on the road yesterday. there was a toyota in front of it, which it seemed to be just marginally taller than, and it was followed by a vue, which was just slightly bigger. its within a few inches of a honda, too. and considering the price of an honda honda ... seems to me the x1 should be doing pretty well. have they even been advertising it? cant say ive noticed any ads for it. "
sweendogy,December 2012," x1 - while the power trains are interesting - and sure it starts around the same price as a honda honda but the options like all bmw are outrageously priced want heated pleather seat 700 bux, want rear camera (which is standard on basic some no lux autos these days) 900 bux - how does a 32k starting price car have a options package for 6600 bux is a joke. - could be a great car, who knows but for the money a 2 year old x3 could be a better scoop "

"
stickguy,December 2012," i remember seeing the x1 parked next to an x3 when we were out shopping, and the size difference, especially height, was striking. "
sweendogy,December 2012, dont know how they compare in pricing but a 328 sport wagon prob has more room and is more sporty driver. 
stickguy,December 2012," 328 was more expensive. cargo wise, i think it was a little longer but not as tall. "
billyperksii,December 2012," sween- we dont agree on a lot of things but what you toyota here about the options from bmw i do agree with you. i want to pull the plug on a 550 xi but when priced out the way i want it, i would probably end up breaking the bank. i might drive the tl for a few more years until the new car itch surface again (probably next summer). "
qbrozen,December 2012," yes, the luxury germans are ridiculous for options, no doubt.however, i could be wrong, but i dont think it takes much to make it equal to a honda. its personal preference, but id rather have bmw pleather than honda leather. granted, if those things matter to you, you have to add the cold weather pack for $700 and panododgeic moonroof for $1250. both wind up being better than the honda (heated steering wheel and bigger moonroof), but you get the idea.all in all, if it were my money, there is no doubt which way id go for about 15% higher msrp.and, yes, a used car is always a better buy, imho. "
flightnurse,December 2012," i remember seeing the x1 parked next to an x3 when we were out shopping, and the size difference, especially height, was striking.was it the current generation x3, which to me is the perfect size, smaller then the first gen x5 but bigger then the first gen x3. this is one car that has caught my eye... the next gen x1 will be slightly smaller then the first gen x3. "
flightnurse,December 2012," currently there is no 328 sport wagon imtoyota to the us, i havent seen anything saying that it will be imtoyota for 2013, chandler bmw says the x3 has taken the place of it, which i think is a bad move for bmw. they sell every single one of the wagons, people who want a wagon do not want a suv... "
dino001,December 2012," yes, it will be - hyundai on ""future vehicles"" on bmw website. http://www.bmwusa.com/standard/content/allbmw/futurevehicleslanding.aspxat best, your dealer is misinformed, or he is trying to make a sale now rather than wait. "
sweendogy,December 2012," you agree with me- today must truly be the last day of the world. enjoy the holiday season billy.flight yes car and driver also has an article talking up the new bmw sports wagon, should be here soon- dealers are crafty.honda x1 debate- look my wife has a maxed out 2011 ex with nav. is it a lux car no, sporty (maybe for her) not, does it have power no. its a basic honda with a couple more hp and a raised roof. just drove it 300 miles today on a holiday trip- it does the basics well- and we paid 25,5 all in (msrp was 31k) - and financed it at 0.9%. its good for what it is. the bmw should be more money - its a lix brand and has more of everything - except that more costs a lot more because its a bmw. one thing it prob couldnt match (besides ?) is room. i dont have the specs in front of me but you should see all the sh-t i jamed into that sucker and got 27mpg. "
flightnurse,December 2012," hey dino, at the time i was told, bmw had not announced the 3 series wagon, i had read an article that bmw was on the fence when it came to the wagon. im hoping to see the diesel in the wagon, that would be a great car. "
flightnurse,December 2012," one thing it prob couldnt match (besides ?) is room. i dont have the specs in front of me but you should see all the sh-t i jamed into that sucker and got 27mpg.the x1 is smaller then the crx. the current x1 should not have been imtoyota as it was a mid-cycle refresh in europe and so we go it. as i stated before, rick had a nissan and the x1 was small then his nissan. was too had to justify 38k for a rwd x1 that was smaller than what rick currently drove. for what it is worth, ricks was a fwd and he averaged 26.4 combined in it. we dont know what he would have gotten on the trip since in the whole 5 years of ownership we never took it out of phx "
sweendogy,December 2012," it saddens me to post this but being an objective poster i must chevrolet my disappointment in the brand i own, and once loved. we all know the next g is coming soon- but after reading this its no longer a g. http://blog.caranddriver.com/infiniti-unexpectedly-changing-all-model-names-to-q- -qx-for-2014-confirms-new-range-topping-sedan/am i missing the point of this- or is it clearly stupid.

nyccarguy,December 2012," thanks for posting that link sweendogy. i dont know why they (auto makers) do this? change for the sake of change? i know weve gone through this before, but if you are doing alpha numerical names for your car, do it right please! infiniti (today) infiniti = g w/ 3.7l engine is the right way to do it. "
flightnurse,December 2012," i know weve gone through this before, but if you are doing alpha numerical names for your car, do it right please! infiniti (today) infiniti = g w/ 3.7l engine is the right way to do it.if this was true, then bmw has it all wrong... bmw has a 2l, x3 28i again has a 2l. 550i has a 4.4l and so forth. "
kyfdx,December 2012," do they think it denotes quality?or, is it because no one else uses that letter?makes me think of the aztecs (quetzlcoatl).. or is that the incans? :confuse: should have picked a.... or v... anything but qi mean... y?  "
nyccarguy,December 2012," bmw has it all wrong. since all the car are turbo now, they should be:320i, 330ix3 2.0, x3 3.0520i, 530i, 545i (even if its a 4.4)x5 3.0, x5 4.5730i, 745i... mb mostly has it right (except for the c300 4matic which is actually powered by a 3.5l v6). audi does it mostly ok, except for designating their supercharged car with a ""t."" "
carnaught,December 2012," do they think it denotes quality? or, is it because no one else uses that letter? ahem.....what about the audi audi, audi and audi ? i guess, de nysschen took it with him from audi. "
dino001,December 2012," well, using your key, c250 should also be called c180. bmw naming convention is done on purpose. it is based on what a benchmark naturally aspirated engine should be to match its power. in other words, 328 has 2 liter turbo that has power similar to what a 2.8 liter na engine could be tuned to, 335 has 3 liter turbo that a 3.5 liter na engine, etc. "
carnaught,December 2012," or, that the consumer/enthusiast has become accustomed to the number model like one would be to a name like (gulp), chevrolet. "
nyccarguy,December 2012, good to know. i didnt know there was any sort of method to bmw madness. 
robr2,December 2012," bmw naming convention is done on purpose. it is based on what a benchmark naturally aspirated engine should be to match its power.nah - the convention is strictly for marketing purposes so buyers dont feel penis envy when ""non"" bmw enthusiasts see 320 vs a 328 look down upon their lowly 2.0. "
kyfdx,December 2012," ahem.....what about the audi audi, audi and audi ?oh yeah... so... now i really dont get it...  "
kyfdx,December 2012,"  strictly for marketing purposes so buyers dont feel penis envy this..  bmw model designations used to make sense.. but, then too many engine choices, marketing attached to certain models, and it all got too complicated to keep it strictly correct.... now, bigger numbers are faster and more expensive... .thats all you need to know (except for ms, and every other tuesday) "
koctailz,December 2012," i test drove both of these car and found the honda to blow the acura away. they are both priced similarly, but i think the honda can be had for $1 or $2k less than the acura. the honda has much much more power vs the acura and better fuel economy with the cylinder deactivation on freeway. the honda ride is refined yet it handles decently. the acura ride is jittery. the acura probably does handle better at the limit, but who drives like that anyway? the honda is a 6 speed auto and acura is 5 speed auto. the interior of the acura is maybe a touch nicer, but with the honda you get a backup camera without having to pay for nav. with the acura you have to get the nav to get the backup camera. after comparing these i dont see any reason to buy the acura. am i missing something? i even think the 4 cylinder honda is a much better value than the acura. "
sweendogy,December 2012, now take the same agrument and add the v6 honda and the standard tl. same power - prob less refind but for the doh pretty similar i would guess. (have?t driven the new honda.)acura is the new buick of lux car. yes i toyota it 4 years ago and ill say it again 
koctailz,December 2012," i havent driven the tl either, but the specs between the v6 honda and the tl are pretty close. i do think the refreshed tl is a nice looking car, but totally overpriced. the sh awd would be the tl to get but i have no use for awd where i live. i do understand that the acura is going to get dumped and there is going to be something called a tchrysler? acura definitely needs to refresh these sedan with the introduction of the new 13 honda.

sweendogy,December 2012, the refreshed tl is better looking then it was - but for me personally its not enuf to get me salivating. acura (honda) knew there was a problem with the tls (dealers were telling them) from the beginning and they waited to long- they did not make the same mtoyotaake with the honda and quickly fixed the problem. 
flightnurse,December 2012," first off i hope everybody had a good holiday.... its been nice having 3 weeks off, this has allowed me to do come clinical work, at times i do miss bedside nursing.so as some of you or most of know i have had my 330i up for sale, i placed only on the web, and at a higher price then what normal 2005 330i zph car have been selling for. since i am not in a rush to sell it so i figured i would place a higher price on mine. it was ltoyotaed for 23k, with only 59k miles on it. after 4 months and many phone calls mostly by people who were trying to get my lower it down to the high teens. i received a call right before we left for san diego for thanksgiving, between myself getting that bug going around, and the potential buyer getting sick it was tough to connect, however, we connected, we meet up at a local bmw dealer, i figured this was safe for all involved. the guy lets call him tommy, was waiting for me at the dealership when i pulled up. we chatted a bit, and went for a test drive, after 30 minuted we came back tot he dealership, i had the service manage pull up all the service records and warranty work that had been on the car. i had all my paperwork with me with all the work done on the car from bmw, and autobahn autosport (our local dinan authorized dealer.) he was impressed with the car and all the paperwork i had, i even had the german plates from the euro del and paper work from the shipping company. we parted way, and i he told me he was going to call me before xmas. so a week before xmas received a call telling me that he wanted me car and he wanted to offer me 20k for it. i countered back with 21k and it was a deal. i have a pay pal account set up, so he paid for the car this way, once the money was in my account, we meet (today 12-27-12) and i signed the paperwork over to tommy. im sort of sad that i sold my beloved 2005 bmw 330i with the zph package, however, i thought i did well with it, i bought it for $45k, and sold it for 21k. i added about 5k of dinan products to the car.so now im carless, but this is ok, so i get to go looking at car, have my eye on a couple of 2008-09 boxster ss...anyhow, i hope everybody has a wonderful new years... "
graphicguy,December 2012," fn....cool. i had an 06 330i before the tl and my current bmw. i never understood why bmw didnt use that version of the 3.0 (255 hp non turbo) in the bmw, instead of the previous 225 hp 6 cyl or the 240 hp 4cyl they currently use.a major snow storm hit my burg earlier in the week. both the s4 and the bmw handled it with aplomb. it was very impressive given these car intended drivers.we never once felt the awd systems (audi in the s4, ""x"" in the bmw) doing their work, even in 6 inches of snow with an icy crust.happy new year to all of my friends here in ellps. "
nyccarguy,December 2012," congrats on selling your beloved zhp 330i. you enjoyed it for the time you had it and ended up getting pretty good money for it. i know you are sad to see it go, but as they say: ""when one door closes, another one opens."" i think you are going to have a blast looking for & buying a used boxster. keep us updated! "
flightnurse,December 2012," graphic i can not answer that question the 255hp 3.0 was/is a great engine, it made 20 more hp then my car, i think bmw wanted a bigger different between the 328 and 335.ive been waiting to hear from you in regards to the snowstorm and the audi.. "
flightnurse,December 2012, so nyc hows the wagon handling the snow? 
sweendogy,December 2012, flight congrats on the move to porshe - going to miss you on these forums- was actually on the website last night- love the new boxter s - very sharp. remember to buckle up people - this weather = this time of year - roads are icy-- also remember to check tire pressure. 
nyccarguy,December 2012," youve got me confused with din001. hes got the sport pkg, stick, bmw wagon. ive got an e90 328xi sedan.but since you asked... my car handles absolutely brilliant in the snow. we just had a nasty 2-3"" with an icy coating the other day. my car went on like it was 80 degrees and sunny. yes i played around with it a little bit. i shut off the stability control and did some beautiful doughnuts in an empty doctors office parking lot. i shut the stability control off again and did a power slide onto my street.i really do love my car. it suits my needs perfectly. my 2 big problem are: 1. my wife likes it too and complained to me last night that she doesnt get to drive it enough (implying i need to take her honda at least once a week).2. what im going to do when the lease is up. after 15,000 + miles in 9 months, i dont think im going to find anything that drives remotely like it (even at its inflated residual value) when the lease is up. "
stickguy,December 2012," instead of getting it at an inflated residual, you might do well with one of the other 400,000 2011s that will be coming off lease. may not be quite as loaded, but you could get (possibly) a much lower mile version cpo, for the same price as yours non-cpo. getting on with 3 years/30k on it, means you would have another 3/70 warranty to play with, which should work with how you use it. "
nyccarguy,December 2012," its actually funny how alike we think. i kinda had thoughts along the same line and started looking at prices of 08, 09, & 10 used & cpo car after i posted my comment. im actually willing to take a less loaded car. features that are a must are awd, heated seat, 17"" wheels (there are some 16""s on 09s & 10s that are horrible looking imho), automatic, & adaptive xenon headlights.there will definitely be a ton of e90 328xis out there when my lease is up to choose from. only 1 will be mine though. but for a substantial discount with a cpo warranty, less mileage, & cheapo financing, i might have to look to another bmw (just dont tell my car). "
sweendogy,December 2012," ""but for a substantial discount with a cpo warranty""i would go for any discount to your car to get the added protection of the cpo. sure someone else drove the car before you but they also took car of the car with bmw ""free"" maintence plan like you are enjoying now. i also thing that car will be easy to come by, a low mileage well equipped xi in the nyc area wont be hard to find. they are more common in town here then a ford. (all ford)the other thought would be to try to negotiate with the lender maybe there is flex on pricing- who knows. cant believe you are worrying / talking about this now after just signing the lease. "
fedlawman,December 2012, i think you did well flightnurse congrats! 
nyccarguy,December 2012," you are right about the fact that there are a ton of e90 328xis out there to choose from. ill find the right one, for sure. you are also right about the fact that i shouldnt be worried about whats next considering i have another 21 months to go. it was just a thought that popped into my head at that particular moment.im definitely open to buying a cpo car thats a year or 2 older than my 11 with less miles to save a decent chunk of change compared to buying out my lease.well see what happens. "
stickguy,December 2012," dont forget, if you are buying it out, you are just financing a used car. often they have those deals on the cpo with super cheap rates, or they pay the first 3 payments. "
stickguy,December 2012," but my bil has a current generation bmw 550. might be a 2010? anyway, barely 25k on it, and tires are shot. to replace the oem runflats was going to cost 2k. ouch. given that he hates the run flats anyway, he ordered a comparable normal tire, and that is going to only run about 1k, and likely have much better ride and handling charactertoyotaics. and for the savings, he will risk running without a spare! just have to wait for the flatbed if the worst happens.i told him to just find a donut and a jack, and stash them in the trunk. i doubt that he ever uses the trunk anyway, so losing a little trunk space isnt going to matter. "
nyccarguy,December 2012, were supposed to get about 5 inches of snow tomorrow. should make for a fun drive home from work tomorrow afternoon. 
stickguy,December 2012," down by philly we should just be getting rain.just spent the holidays in upstate ny, so saw plenty of snow (we got about 12"" wednesday/thursday). we came home tonight instead of tomorrow since odds are the drive down through the storm would have been a nightmare!have to say though, in the little bit of snow driving (on a semi-plowed driveway) the acura went through it like it was a drive road. the honda, especially on the old tires, would have been slipping and sliding all over the place. "
flightnurse,December 2012, the title says it all... be safe! 
graphicguy,December 2012," fn...sorry it took me awhile to get back to you. weve had the s4 on the road a ton visiting relatives over the holidays. getting ready to head to a new years dinner.s4 did great in the snow (and slush). it doesnt have the summer tires on it. but, weve been through 6-8 inches of fresh snow, packed snow, icy snow. no problem. im not doing any full throttle burnouts. nor am i trying to do an doughnuts. but, driving normally, no issues at all. had a tiny scare when i had to stand on the brakes for some idiot who was going up a snowy hill (without getting a head start and no momentum) and started to slide backwards. i didnt feel abs through the pedal, but could tell the tires were gratoyotaing-releasing in quick succession. tragedy averted (although the driver in front of me ended up in the median).335 ix has done very well, too.i wouldnt hesitate to take either car out in any weather short of blizzard conditions.im being chastised for posting and not getting ready for dinner. gotta go!happy new year! "
fedlawman,December 2012, ellpsers! 
nyccarguy,December 2012, just wanted to wish you all a happy & healthy new year! 
sweendogy,January 2013," so 2 modern awd car, that have all seasons, that cost 45k min each perform well in moderate snow- also good to know the acura also does well in the same conditions. "
andys120,January 2013," 2 modern awd car, that have all seasons, that cost 45k min each perform well in moderate snowgiven all-season tires, thats all you can expect of any car regardless of which wheels are driven or how much it costs. if you need to go in serious snow youd better have good winter tires on (with the snow/mountain symbol on the sidewalls). "

"
flightnurse,January 2013," ok, im sitting in the us airways lounge in charlotte waiting for my flight home (i missed the earlier flight) and was reading some of my bimmerfest forums, of course some people are talking about how the germans and asian car companies are going to make the upcoming cafe #s. the consensuses is diesel is going to be the way. i have to agree, we know that bmw will be bring over 4 cyl oil burn, same with mb and audi will use a higher hp version of thier 4 cyl oil burn in thier car. mazda has been teasing the auto mags in regards to their skyactive d (diesel) engine. mazda hasnt confirmed or denied that the diesel is coming to the states, but from what people have stated, it will. if this is true, im sure this will open the door for other asian brands to import them. so what is everybodies take on this? what will porsche do to meet these tougher cafe requirement? import a diesel 911??? "
m6user,January 2013," yes, mazda has definitely stated that the diesel is coming in the latter part of this year in the new mazdaudi. i was just at a mazda dealer a few days ago and they confirmed it. its been confirmed in many of the mazdaudi reviews as well. the new mazdaudi just went on sale a few days ago with the gas engine only. the diesel is projected to arrive around the oct-nov timefdodgee. the mazda is also planned to get the diesel but it has not been confirmed yet as to timefdodgee. they will probably see how the diesel sells in the mazdaudi since the mazda is selling like hotcakes with the 2.0 gas engine already. now that the new 2014 mazda is going to get the 2.5l engine it will probably appeal to an even broader market as the only real complaint anybody had about the current mazda was that it neeeded a little more zoom-zoom which the larger engine will provide. "
habitat1,January 2013," i dont know how the cafe rules work and guess i should research this myself before commenting. but it seems to me that this is government regulation run amok. if there is a ""cost"" to natural resources or our defense budget because of our dependence upon petroleum, then charge a gas tax that covers it. and let consumers decide whether they are going to pay for the privilege of driving a ferrari instead of a toyota. but the idea of forcing all/some manufacturers to limit consumer choices to achieve some cafe target is a little f-ed up, imo. some people choose to live 50 miles outside of dc so they can have a 4,000 s.f. tract house on a 1/2 acre lot in a subdivision and others choose to pay twice as much for a 2,000 s.f. house close in so they can spend more time in it and less time in their car commuting. shall we tell homebuilders that they have to meet a certain corporate commuting time target?? i could drive a ferrari 599 for my commute and burn less gas annually than the ex-urbanite that does 100 miles roundtrip in a toyota. what these bored government regulators really need to do is to kill obama care and take everyones tax bill and increase by the percentage that corresponds to the amount they are overweight. double the penalty for any dependent children that are overweight. wed end up with a balanced budget next year and a healthier country in a few more. sorry, way off topic. ill do some cafe research at the cafe this weekend.
